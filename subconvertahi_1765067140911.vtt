2
00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.333
"Made of earth and stone."

3
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.833
"A snow-clad heart."

4
00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.291
"And icy bones."

5
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.958
From the depths of the mountains.
the trolls rose.

6
00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:35.541
For a long time.
humans and trolls lived side by side…

7
00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.916
…in perfect harmony.

8
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:44.541
Until a new world order crept over Europe.

9
00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:50.666
In Norway. a young king was assigned
to Christianize the country…

10
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.083
Olaf the Holy.

11
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.958
The new faith had no room
for primordial beings of the Earth.

12
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.291
From the safety of their dark forests.

13
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:04.458
Olaf drove them out into the sunlight.

14
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:07.541
where they were turned to stone.

15
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.000
With sword and bible in hand.

16
00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.458
Olaf scoured the land of trolls.

17
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:16.583
As the massacre progressed.

18
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:21.250
the trolls grew wary
of the sanctity of Christianity.

19
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:24.125
The age of the trolls

20
00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:25.166
was over.

21
00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:29.083
Olaf showed no mercy.

22
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.166
slaughtering everyone.
both adults and children...

23
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.125
And let's pause the story there. alright?

24
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.500
But Mama. this is the part
about the troll mass a-cred.

25
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:40.041
Massacre.

26
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.750
Papa… that Olaf the Holy.

27
00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.416
what's wrong with him?

28
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.875
The trolls were there first!

29
00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:46.916
Yes. exactly.

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.125
The trolls needed our help
for them to survive.

31
00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.208
-That's what I would do.
-I know. Nora.

32
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.625
No one stood up against the narrow-minded
humans to protect the trolls.

33
00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:56.541
Okay. I would leave now.

34
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:59.833
before I toss your butt
out of here myself. Tidemann.

35
00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:02.208
We'll save the rest for later.

36
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.708
Good night. Tiny.

37
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.833
Good night. Big.

38
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:10.333
"Troll massacre?"

39
00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.625
I could've went with
Askeladden's eating contest.

40
00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:15.167
where the troll guts itself
so its entrails spill out.

41
00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:21.083
You okay. sweetie?

42
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.416
You're okay?

43
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.791
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

44
00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:29.000
-Are you sure?
-Promise.

45
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:30.625
Mama?

46
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:31.708
Mm?

47
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:33.125
The troll wedding story…

48
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:34.833
-You remember it. right?
-Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.833
Do you really think that mean
Olaf chased them up there?

50
00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.666
-Mm-hmm.
-And that's why they died up there?

51
00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:43.833
Yeah.

52
00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:46.458
I think it's a possibility he did. right?

53
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.583
-Mm-hmm.
-Absolutely.

54
00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:51.791
Out.

55
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.625
One day we'll go see it. Nora.

56
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.500
The Troll Wall.

57
00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.250
-You promise?
-Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.291
Promise.

59
00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:03.250
Sleep now.

60
00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm not tired.

61
00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.000
Can you sing a song?

62
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.750

75
00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.166
Hello?

76
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:17.875
No!

77
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.125
Nora. Nora!
Wait. it's me! It's me!

78
00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:25.250
It's me!

79
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:30.166
Andreas Isaksen?

80
00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:38.500
-It's been a while.
-Uh-huh.

81
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.083
I… I came here by myself.

82
00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:56.541
The Tidemann hospitality
is alive and well.

83
00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.166
Yeah. well…

84
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.291
I don't get visitors that often.

85
00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:09.208
I guess not.

86
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.833
You're out here alone.

87
00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:18.083
What you been up to?

88
00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:20.291
Since we last talked?

89
00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.000
Listen. Andreas.

90
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:32.583
I mean no offense.
And it's great to see you again. really.

91
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:36.208
But now. just tell me why you're here.

92
00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:38.750
I. um…

93
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:43.458
ON THE TRAIL OF SAINT OLAF'S TOMB

94
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:45.083
Uh…

95
00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:48.000
I hoped you could help us solve a problem.

96
00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:49.833
Us?

97
00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:52.000
Uh. yeah…

98
00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.416
Is it a national security thing?

99
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.875
It's a secret.
and I'm supposed to go somewhere?

100
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.416
Um…

101
00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:02.958
Well…

102
00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:09.791
-You said that life was behind you. right?
-Yeah. I thought it was. I really did.

103
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.416
But just when you think you're out.

104
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.583
they pull you back in. right?

105
00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.541
Things are different now.

106
00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.041
A new government.

107
00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:30.000
THE PALACE DENIES ACCUSATIONS

108
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:32.875
-New prime minister.
-Yeah. right.

109
00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.041
It doesn't matter who's in power.
It's still the old guard.

110
00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:38.458
WITHDRAWS FROM TROLL COMMISSION

111
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.583
Hmm.

112
00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:41.583
RESTRAINING ORDER FROM THE PALACE

113
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:46.958
A FISTFUL OF ZEN

114
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:54.291
You wasted your time coming out here.

115
00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:56.500
Ha ha!

116
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.833
I didn't know the definition of pain until
12-year-old TikTokers reviewed my book.

117
00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.125
I haven't had time…

118
00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:08.667
-No. I get it. It's no biggie.
-I've been…

119
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.238
I saw you dedicated it to Papa.
That's really sweet.

120
00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.000
He'd have liked that.

121
00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.250
Honestly.

122
00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:25.125
I think he'd like to see
what I want to show you.

123
00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.250
I'm confused.

124
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.875
What we found…

125
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.458
Is there… more?

126
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.416
What the hell…

127
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.791
Uh… It's just a formality.

128
00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:14.375
You really think that my signing this
will stop me from speaking after?

129
00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:15.458
Not really.

130
00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.416
But if you speak about this. Nora.

131
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.291
people are definitely gonna think
that you've gone mad.

132
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:36.125
Thanks.

133
00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:40.833
TINY TROLLY MOLLY

134
00:09:49.916 --> 00:09:51.000
Vemork?

135
00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:03.000
VEMORK POWER STATION

136
00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.583
Professor Sinkhole?

137
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.500
Right. you need no introductions
to Professors Møller and Wangel.

138
00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:25.375
Professor Tidemann. Welcome to Vemork.

139
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.208
I know this might come
as a bit of a shock.

140
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.000
Yeah. you could say that.

141
00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.125
Professor. it's a great regret of mine

142
00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.416
that we started
on such bad terms last time…

143
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.416
At the time. the government didn't have
security clearance for Project Jotun

144
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.041
and the information we've gathered.

145
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.666
Yeah. but over time some secrets come out.

146
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.416
-Sooner or later.
-Yeah.

147
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.166
Like trolls in sunlight.

148
00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:51.333
What are you talking about?

149
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:54.333
Someone has always known about it.

150
00:10:57.166 --> 00:11:01.125
We have all heard about what happened
in Vemork during World War II.

151
00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:03.541
The Heroes of Telemark.

152
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:06.041
The race to create the first atomic bomb.

153
00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:09.416
The heavy water sabotage operation
to foil Hitler's plans.

154
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.333
A cover-up…
for what the mission was really about.

155
00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:18.041
The operation. Professor Tidemann.
was never about the heavy water.

156
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.583
That's her.

157
00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:20.041
Those who found him a century ago

158
00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.625
named him Jotun.

159
00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.958
after the primeval trolls from mythology.

160
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:27.125
But I…

161
00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:29.500
I call him

162
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:31.083
Mega-troll.

163
00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.166
Of course. we have safeguards in place.

164
00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.666
-For security.
-UV lights are pointed at the troll.

165
00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:44.875
Powerful enough to turn
it into stone instantly.

166
00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.583
Inspired by
your creative solution in Oslo.

167
00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:50.041
Mm-hm.

168
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.791
Have you all lost your minds?

169
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.750
-Do we have a visitor?
-What is this?

170
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.208
Oh. Uh…

171
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:58.458
-Yes. Let me introduce Professor...
-Marion Auryn Rhadani.

172
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.583
I'm the project leader.

173
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:03.250
This is the legendary
Professor Nora Tidemann.

174
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:04.958
Of course I know who you are.

175
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:08.541
I thought we agreed
not to involve her.

176
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.833
Hmm?

177
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.708
If we don't show
any progress soon.

178
00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:17.208
they'll shut down the whole project.

179
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.208
Sorry. what did you say?

180
00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:22.041
My apologies. Farsi.

181
00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:23.875
I learned when I was in college.

182
00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.625
But Professor Rhadani
is an evolutionary biologist.

183
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.583
so she's been leading
this research for almost...

184
00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:29.583
-Two years.
-Two years.

185
00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:30.886
The past two years. yeah.

186
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.708
And Andreas has told us
all about your work

187
00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:36.750
and your heroics in Oslo.

188
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.041
Of course. it's not the outcome
that I would have liked.

189
00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:44.583
A conscious troll would have provided
many more useful answers.

190
00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:48.083
Okay. so… he's not dead?

191
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.541
No. Hibernating.

192
00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:52.291
Ever since it was discovered here.

193
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.375
the only sign of life is a pulse.

194
00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:58.291
Some kind of heart is hidden inside there.

195
00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:01.458
But it's unique.
It's unlike any animal on the planet.

196
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.625
The closest thing that I could ascribe
to it would be the forest floor.

197
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:09.791
Yeah. the DNA's a mystery.
It's more spruce tree than human.

198
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:12.291
They are nature.

199
00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:15.083
They're what?

200
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:17.708
Trolls are nature.

201
00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:20.666
"Made of earth and stone."

202
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.726
-"A snow-clad heart and..."
-"Snow-clad heart and icy bones."

203
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.708
A kids' nursery rhyme.

204
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:27.708
Hm. Okay.

205
00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.666
Right. Are we finished here?

206
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.041
What? No!

207
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.458
You… you haven't seen it all.

208
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:38.041
Don't go yet. Come. come.

209
00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:47.416
Welcome to the Nerd Room.

210
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.208
Nora! Hi.

211
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.833
Siggy!

212
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.625
It's mine.

213
00:15:00.708 --> 00:15:02.416
That is… ours.

214
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.208
-Really?
-Well. we weren't romantic at the start.

215
00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:07.500
No. but it became that way.
obviously. right?

216
00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:09.208
Yeah. obviously.

217
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:12.625
Now. it became
this itty bitty creature. in here.

218
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.416
A little nilbog.

219
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.166
"Leonard" if it's a boy.

220
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.833
And if it's a girl. we'll name her Uhura.

221
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.166
Hm.

222
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.125
Congratulations.

223
00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:26.458
Thank you.

224
00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.208
But… but that's not what
I wanted you to see.

225
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.791
Look around.

226
00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:35.125
In this area. we have texts written
in Latin. Old Norse. Sanskrit. and runes.

227
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:36.625
Some of them predate Christ.

228
00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:38.791
And…

229
00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:40.958
All about trolls.

230
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:44.125
See that?

231
00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.875
Olaf the Holy's Troll Law.

232
00:15:55.416 --> 00:15:56.250
Huh?

233
00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:59.416
Its carbon date is around 1030.

234
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:03.583
Before he fell in the Battle
of Stiklestad. Just before or after.

235
00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.875
Well. um… not after. right?

236
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.250
He wouldn't be signing
anything from the grave. Yeah?

237
00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:13.666
It's been verified.
That's… that's the real deal.

238
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.958
It's clear
what his intention was.

239
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.500
Even though half
of the document's missing.

240
00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:21.875
"Trolls shall…"

241
00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:24.625
Hereby be expelled

242
00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:27.041
"from this land."

243
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:31.541
Papa was right.

244
00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:36.208
We know there was a troll from Dovre.

245
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.666
We have our troll here.

246
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.041
It's safe to assume that there may be more
trolls out there. We don't know how many.

247
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:45.416
-There's a very real chance…
-That another troll goes berserk.

248
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.708
We have to be prepared.

249
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:48.750
If we're going to be ready.
first we need to…

250
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.000
Understand more.

251
00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.250
We have so many resources here to utilize.

252
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:57.666
but despite that.
the progress of our research has stopped.

253
00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.791
They're threatening to shut us down.

254
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:04.166
We need someone who thinks out of the box.

255
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:09.041
We need the great Professor Nora Tidemann.

256
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.041
I. uh…
I just need a second to process this.

257
00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:28.500
I really need to use the restroom.
Is one nearby?

258
00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:31.125
Downstairs. You'll see the sign.
One floor down.

259
00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:34.083
I could sprint down there blindfolded.
I'm peeing every…

260
00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:40.041
-One floor down. then right.
-Okay. Thank you.

261
00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:02.166
I've rewritten this report 11 times.
There's always something.

262
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:56.708
I wonder who you are.

263
00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.375
Ow.

264
00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:37.416
What was that?

265
00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:40.708
An awakening.

266
00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:00.750
Set the UV lights to standby.

267
00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.833
-Activate them on my signal.
-Yeah.

268
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.333
Not yet. Wait.

269
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.458
Siggy. Siggy.

270
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.958
This doesn't feel right.

271
00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.541
Ready.

272
00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:19.375
-Take your hand off.
-Huh?

273
00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:21.875
-What's the problem?
-We can't destroy it now.

274
00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.416
Are you crazy? It's finally awake.

275
00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:29.750
-Now!
-Wait. you can't.

276
00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:31.041
Do it!

277
00:21:43.333 --> 00:21:44.458
Nora!

278
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:46.458
Come down here now!

279
00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:55.961
Siggy. time to go. Time to go.
Everybody out! Everybody out!

280
00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:57.666
Everybody out!

281
00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:12.000
Nora!

282
00:22:24.708 --> 00:22:26.750
Come on. Siggy! Run!

283
00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:30.863
-Marion! Take Siggy with you!
-Yeah. Siggy. come on!

284
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:32.708
Nora!

285
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:35.000
Nora. come on.

286
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:48.416
Huh.

287
00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:50.958
Ugh!

288
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.791
Andreas!

289
00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:01.583
Go!

290
00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:05.000
Siggy. are you all right?
Come on. Come on!

291
00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:31.958
Dear God.

292
00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:34.250
How did you do that?

293
00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:47.291
AIR FORCE BASE

294
00:24:07.458 --> 00:24:08.916
Captain Kris.

295
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.958
Nora Tidemann.

296
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:12.416
I should have known.

297
00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:15.833
And Isaksen. tagging along as usual.

298
00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:17.250
Good to see you're not alone.

299
00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:18.625
Holm.

300
00:24:18.708 --> 00:24:19.833
Everybody on board.

301
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.291
Hi.

302
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:32.666
Hey there.

303
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.000
-Here.
-Yeah.

304
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.250
-Thanks.
-My pleasure.

305
00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:45.708
A new girl.

306
00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:48.667
But Captain Kris is the same guy.

307
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.500
Actually I'm a… major now.

308
00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.750
Kris the major?

309
00:24:55.875 --> 00:24:56.875
Yeah.

310
00:24:58.083 --> 00:24:59.833
Feel free to call me whatever.

311
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.667
This research could lead to breakthroughs
in medical science. Climate change...

312
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.292
You treat him like he's a being
with no inherent value.

313
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:08.958
You haven't looked at the implications.

314
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:13.333
Problem with your stupid implications is
placing humans over other sentient beings.

315
00:25:13.416 --> 00:25:14.833
-It's a recipe...
-You are both right.

316
00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:16.167
Andreas. stay out of this!

317
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.125
Every living being has
inherent value and deserves respect.

318
00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:21.208
It's eerily similar to
my parents' split-up.

319
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.166
You can't be so narrow-minded.

320
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.458
You're ignoring what's self-evident.
That this is a living being with feelings.

321
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:30.208
Your head is so far up your...

322
00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:32.916
-Prime Minister.
-Major Holm.

323
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
General.

324
00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:37.291
Prime Minister Brinchmann.
meet Nora Tidemann.

325
00:25:37.375 --> 00:25:38.541
Right.

326
00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:40.500
-Professor Tidemann.
-Hi.

327
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.875
-Rhadani.
-Hi. Martin.

328
00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:46.625
-Right. Isaksen.
-Prime Minister.

329
00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:48.333
And you are…

330
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:51.666
I'm Hodne. Staff Sergeant.

331
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.000
Pleasure's all mine.

332
00:25:53.083 --> 00:25:54.625
Uh. sir. she's pregnant.

333
00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:57.000
Yeah.

334
00:25:58.708 --> 00:25:59.583
Mm…

335
00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:03.458
Ever since government officials and I
got the details surrounding Project Jotun.

336
00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:06.000
I believed the risks involved
were too high.

337
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:09.125
And the incident today.
it proves that I was right.

338
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:11.125
Martin. I have another idea.

339
00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:14.375
There's potentially
a great opportunity here.

340
00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:17.042
It's my view. if there's a chance
that we can capture it

341
00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:19.750
and get it under our control.
we can continue...

342
00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:21.791
There's no controlling natural forces.

343
00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:24.750
You can't go forward with that plan.

344
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:27.167
-That's my...
-Okay. well… what's your plan. then?

345
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.000
-Allow it to go free? Free to roam around?
-I didn't say that.

346
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.042
-Explain it. Tell us.
-I'm pointing to a problem...

347
00:26:32.125 --> 00:26:35.583
I know this research could be of value.
but I have to put Norwegian lives first.

348
00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:38.416
Therefore. I'm doing
what I should have done initially.

349
00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:42.750
I want the troll terminated.
effective immediately.

350
00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:43.750
Mmm.

351
00:26:43.833 --> 00:26:44.916
Oh my God.

352
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Okay. so this time we're all
gonna repeat the same mistakes?

353
00:26:48.083 --> 00:26:50.375
Turn an innocent troll
to stone because of us.

354
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:52.708
You're saying you've learned
nothing from Dovre?

355
00:26:52.791 --> 00:26:55.669
Three years ago. I lost my brother
in a helicopter accident.

356
00:26:56.958 --> 00:27:00.416
It was… a military operation
someone suggested.

357
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.875
using church bells.

358
00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:07.000
I won't repeat the mistakes
of the last prime minister.

359
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.958
Major Holm. join us to debrief.

360
00:27:18.041 --> 00:27:19.291
Copy that. General.

361
00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:42.000
Hey. is… is that a… a piece of…

362
00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:45.458
It's a piece of guilty conscience.

363
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.083
I screwed up. and it's a reminder.

364
00:27:57.166 --> 00:27:59.291
I have a talent for screwing up.

365
00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:08.875
But. as the. uh… the fairy tales tell us.

366
00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:11.333
learn from mistakes…

367
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.458
Grow stronger…

368
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.500
And keep fighting.

369
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:43.625
Hmm?

370
00:28:48.958 --> 00:28:50.208
Where are you going?

371
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:51.875
On an adventure.

372
00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:54.750
Hey. ho.

373
00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:57.291
Let's go!

374
00:28:58.083 --> 00:29:00.875
We tracked the troll
and lost him in the fog.

375
00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:02.750
but it will clear up this evening.

376
00:29:02.833 --> 00:29:04.638
Around sunset...

377
00:29:06.166 --> 00:29:08.583
Losing the sun means
the enemy can move freely.

378
00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:10.375
So time is of the...

379
00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:13.833
Time's of the essence.

380
00:29:13.916 --> 00:29:17.250
Aw-Geedi.
Time to put our new toys to the test.

381
00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:21.166
Everyone ready in 30. Execute.

382
00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:25.000
-Kris?
-No.

383
00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:28.000
-I haven't told you what...
-I said no.

384
00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:30.958
Check the intel again.
I want us airborne in 45.

385
00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:32.916
-Copy that.
-Amir!

386
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:37.375
-Nice to see you again.
-Mm-hmm.

387
00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:39.125
Right. From Oslo.

388
00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:43.291
-Of course. I remember.
-That's great. Hey…

389
00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:46.625
-Yeah?
-Last time. you were a scientific advisor.

390
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:48.583
Technically. Ish.

391
00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:52.500
It would be irresponsible for a major
to take civilians on a mission.

392
00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:54.583
Come on. Major. schmajor. stop with that.

393
00:29:54.666 --> 00:29:57.458
-We have a troll roaming around.
-Sorry. it's time to go.

394
00:29:57.541 --> 00:30:00.500
Seeing you two together
again turns my stomach.

395
00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:02.666
-It's not exactly ideal.
-Copy that.

396
00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:06.458
Kris!

397
00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:08.250
You owe it to my dad!

398
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.333
It's not like that.

399
00:30:15.416 --> 00:30:17.458
I wasn't insinuating that you…

400
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.625
No. that came out wrong. I meant to say...

401
00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:22.000
Lives were lost.
and I have to live with that.

402
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.041
I messed up.

403
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.958
had bad judgment.

404
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.708
I won't make that mistake now.

405
00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:31.250
My father was the happiest
when he died that day.

406
00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:34.291
We gave him that.

407
00:30:37.458 --> 00:30:38.500
I…

408
00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:41.833
Uh… I dedicated my life to this.

409
00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:48.916
Please. Kris.

410
00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:00.291
Fine. But only...

411
00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:13.208
You'll stay in the background
and do what I say.

412
00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:15.583
-Are we on the same page?
-Yeah. absolutely.

413
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.458
What's the plan. then?

414
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:24.291
The military's new SUNNA helicopter.

415
00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:26.583
Custom-made build for troll hunting.

416
00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:30.541
Equipped with UV lights powerful
enough to make crispy troll fries.

417
00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:33.541
SUNNA… Old Norse for "sun."

418
00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:38.583
-Cool.
-Yeah. we think so too.

419
00:31:38.666 --> 00:31:41.458
And now. we have… a lean. mean.

420
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:43.500
…troll-killing machine!

421
00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:45.666
-Oof…
-I hope you brought sunscreen.

422
00:31:46.375 --> 00:31:48.750
Hey! Room for one more?

423
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:57.500
You mind if I tag along?

424
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:00.333
I kinda feel like it's my troll.

425
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.375
The more. the merrier.

426
00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:03.916
Oh. thanks.

427
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.208
I never heard of a major going on
a mission like this. Is it normal?

428
00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:10.166
I'm more of the hands-on type.
You know the deal.

429
00:32:11.875 --> 00:32:13.375
Everybody on board.

430
00:32:16.875 --> 00:32:19.000
He's flirting with me. right?

431
00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:21.083
Better get used to it.

432
00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:22.625
Kris?

433
00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:29.541
Promise you'll return the same height
and intact. Andropholus Maximus.

434
00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:32.250
Hey… Siggy Starcrash…

435
00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:35.583
I swear I will.

436
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.708
You hear that?

437
00:32:42.166 --> 00:32:43.666
My little stardust love.

438
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.958
Isaksen! Get your butt in gear
if you're coming!

439
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:02.666
Don't try to be a hero. okay?

440
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.375
You're Clark Kent. not Superman.

441
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:16.750
I'll be back again before you know it!

442
00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:20.875
Love you.

443
00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:33.958
HEMSEDAL SKI RESORT

444
00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:00.250
Keep it open. cool?

445
00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:10.625
Yeah! I love it!

446
00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:11.833
Aw. how cute!

447
00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:14.208
-Your mom's here?
-Shut up. bro.

448
00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:34.250
Help!

449
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:10.958
Amir. what do you think?

450
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:13.458
Looks like the party's over. bro!

451
00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:15.041
It's eating them!

452
00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:16.666
Oh. my God!

453
00:36:18.333 --> 00:36:20.833
Tidemann! Sit down now.

454
00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:21.958
Don't worry I'm fine.

455
00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:23.500
Safety procedures.

456
00:36:27.708 --> 00:36:29.166
Standby for my command.

457
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.458
Whenever you're ready.

458
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.833
Let there be light.

459
00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:48.583
And there was…

460
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.625
Whoo!

461
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.916
We're going in!

462
00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:09.916
We're cookin' now.

463
00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:12.625
Hard right.

464
00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:13.625
Hard right!

465
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.583
Kris.

466
00:37:22.583 --> 00:37:23.875
Give the troll space.

467
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:29.125
Burn. baby. burn!

468
00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:36.958
Ugh!

469
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:54.666
Status. Amir?

470
00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:02.625
Amir?

471
00:38:05.708 --> 00:38:06.875
Kris.

472
00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:11.500
It was an honor. brother.

473
00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:22.708
Amir!

474
00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:41.666
Kris?

475
00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:50.791
Kris.

476
00:38:52.666 --> 00:38:53.833
Kristoffer?

477
00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.083
Don't do anything stupid. alright?

478
00:39:07.375 --> 00:39:08.583
Major Holm!

479
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.041
Please. sir. I can assure you.

480
00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.375
we have everything under control.

481
00:39:46.583 --> 00:39:49.125
Involving NATO at this point
would only cause…

482
00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:55.083
Mr. President.
I'm afraid I will have to call you back.

483
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:22.458
Allah Yerhamo. Amir Aw-Geedi…

484
00:40:24.666 --> 00:40:25.791
My brother.

485
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.416
I… I wasn't aware
they were such ruthless. um…

486
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:42.291
Killing machines.

487
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.458
Not all of them are like that.

488
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:47.083
Okay?

489
00:40:47.166 --> 00:40:50.125
This one is acting different
than the troll from three years ago.

490
00:40:50.208 --> 00:40:53.667
The reports I read talked about how
it killed both civilians and soldiers.

491
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.291
Yeah. but those reports never
said what he wanted.

492
00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:58.791
To get back home.

493
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:01.583
"Home."

494
00:41:01.666 --> 00:41:02.708
Yeah.

495
00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:07.208
I think you should try a little harder
not to humanize these monsters. okay?

496
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.250
If it's a monster. it's because of man.

497
00:41:13.333 --> 00:41:16.000
-It's our doing.
-We haven't done any harm to it.

498
00:41:16.958 --> 00:41:19.541
Not us. directly. Men who lived before us.

499
00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:25.083
It's not like you've helped with how you
prodded and experimented on him for years.

500
00:41:25.958 --> 00:41:28.541
I'll make sure to say sorry to it
when I see it.

501
00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:34.875
Can we do that?

502
00:41:34.958 --> 00:41:37.000
Can we communicate with it?

503
00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:42.125
Yeah. We'll use our grown-up voices
and tell it to stop.

504
00:41:55.416 --> 00:41:57.375
I have an idea of someone who can.

505
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:02.916
RESTRICTED MILITARY AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

506
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.666
DOVRE MOUNTAINS

507
00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:40.666
Here.

508
00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:42.375
Oh. Ooh!

509
00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:49.166
Thank you. Kris… toffer.

510
00:42:50.041 --> 00:42:51.166
You guys coming?

511
00:42:51.708 --> 00:42:52.750
Of course.

512
00:42:57.583 --> 00:43:01.000
Didn't the army do a thorough search
of this area three years ago?

513
00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:02.083
Yeah.

514
00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:04.083
They sure did.

515
00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:10.291
ODDRUN. LARS. AND SOLO

516
00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:12.666
A bit more to the left? Okay. How's that?

517
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.083
Yeah.

518
00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:18.125
That'll do.

519
00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:25.833
I think Oddrun is gonna be overjoyed.

520
00:43:27.791 --> 00:43:29.541
Well. speak of the angel.

521
00:43:31.958 --> 00:43:34.792
-Hello? Can you hear me?
-Huh? Yeah. yeah. I can hear you.

522
00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:37.458
Lars. honey. you have to say hello
when you pick up the phone.

523
00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:39.666
Yeah. I know. Hello?

524
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.000
-I found the wallpaper for the bedroom.
-That's great.

525
00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:44.208
Is there anything else
I should get while I'm here?

526
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:45.833
I can't hear anything you're saying.

527
00:43:45.916 --> 00:43:48.542
Sorry. Solo's acting up.
He's barking like crazy. What's going on?

528
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.375
Is there anything else
I should get while I'm here?

529
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.833
Lars?

530
00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:08.625
Lars…

531
00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.041
Lars?

532
00:44:16.125 --> 00:44:18.833
Lars. we only needed the wallpaper. right?

533
00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:22.500
-Oddrun…
-Yeah.

534
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.250
I think we need more than wallpaper. dear.

535
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:35.500
I'm really sorry about your friend Amir.

536
00:44:37.083 --> 00:44:38.083
Thanks.

537
00:44:39.458 --> 00:44:41.541
Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up now.

538
00:44:41.625 --> 00:44:43.916
-I'm sorry. Bad timing.
-No. it's fine.

539
00:44:45.875 --> 00:44:47.041
He was…

540
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:51.666
He was my brother

541
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:53.541
from another mother.

542
00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:58.625
-Our childhoods were similar.
-I see.

543
00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:00.583
Our families were…

544
00:45:00.666 --> 00:45:01.500
Tough.

545
00:45:01.583 --> 00:45:02.666
Oh.

546
00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.125
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

547
00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:09.625
No. it's refreshing.

548
00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:11.083
It seems to me like

549
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:13.625
there's a really big heart
hiding underneath

550
00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:16.541
that… really cool. um. uniform.

551
00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:19.416
Eww…

552
00:45:27.875 --> 00:45:29.625
Oh. God. What happened in here?

553
00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:32.083
It's a hunting pit.

554
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.041
According to the legend.
they wanted to get rid of the Troll King.

555
00:45:39.458 --> 00:45:42.125
so they kidnapped a troll child.

556
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:44.291
so the father would follow it here.

557
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:48.333
Straight into a death trap.

558
00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:55.125
There are symbols carved in.

559
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:58.250
They're Christian symbols.

560
00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:01.750
They're carved into each spike.
to inflict more damage on the trolls.

561
00:46:03.666 --> 00:46:07.500
But the Troll King survived the trap.
He escaped three years ago.

562
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.500
But if the story's true.
the question remains.

563
00:46:12.208 --> 00:46:15.458
Why weren't the remains
of the captured troll child ever found?

564
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:20.375
Hold still.

565
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:22.583
Stay there.

566
00:46:52.583 --> 00:46:53.666
Don't freak out.

567
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.750
Just. uh…

568
00:46:55.541 --> 00:46:57.083
Try remaining calm. okay?

569
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.125
It's hypernature.

570
00:47:11.958 --> 00:47:13.041
Shh.

571
00:47:13.125 --> 00:47:14.250
-Shh. Kris.
-Whoa.

572
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.666
Lower your weapon.

573
00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:25.583
Put it down carefully.

574
00:47:27.625 --> 00:47:30.458
Don't shine light in the troll's eyes.

575
00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:33.375
You're okay.

576
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.708
Keep still.

577
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.125
I searched here dozens of times
and couldn't find anything.

578
00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:05.708
But he didn't feel safe.
He was watching from the dark.

579
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.833
-Is it really…?
-Yeah.

580
00:48:08.916 --> 00:48:10.833
He's the son of the Mountain King.

581
00:48:26.708 --> 00:48:27.875
Hi there. Beautiful.

582
00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:04.750
Nora Tidemann.

583
00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:06.375
troll whisperer.

584
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.958
How'd you do that?

585
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:15.000
I know it sounds crazy. but I… feel it.

586
00:49:16.125 --> 00:49:17.208
I feel it.

587
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.666
It's a mystery.

588
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:30.416
Come. It's all right.

589
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:49.208
Don't think.

590
00:49:50.708 --> 00:49:51.916
Just feel.

591
00:50:31.708 --> 00:50:32.791
Hello.

592
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.708
What do I call you?

593
00:50:36.791 --> 00:50:38.416
I've been calling him Beautiful.

594
00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:40.375
Beautiful.

595
00:50:41.708 --> 00:50:43.292
It's a pleasure.

596
00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:44.666
Magical.

597
00:50:54.041 --> 00:50:55.333
So. uh…

598
00:50:55.416 --> 00:50:57.166
The next part is difficult.

599
00:50:58.125 --> 00:51:01.666
There's someone
that only you can talk to. so…

600
00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:07.541
I need to ask a favor.
and this one's pretty big.

601
00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:12.125
Hmm?

602
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.500
It's their fight this time.

603
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.666
We're going. Start it up.

604
00:53:37.625 --> 00:53:38.625
Nora!

605
00:53:38.708 --> 00:53:40.041
-Run!
-Get to the bird!

606
00:54:14.833 --> 00:54:15.833
Come on!

607
00:54:19.541 --> 00:54:20.708
Run.

608
00:54:24.958 --> 00:54:26.125
Come on!

609
00:54:32.208 --> 00:54:33.416
Keep running!

610
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.916
Go. go. go!

611
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.625
Go. go. go. go. go!

612
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:42.375
Hard right!

613
00:55:28.416 --> 00:55:33.375
DOMBÅS AIR AMBULANCE BASE
DOVRE MOUNTAINS

614
00:55:53.958 --> 00:55:55.083
I wonder…

615
00:55:56.333 --> 00:55:58.500
How did you find out the secret

616
00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:00.416
of how to communicate with him?

617
00:56:02.541 --> 00:56:03.833
Hmm.

618
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.208
I got quiet.

619
00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:09.916
And I began to listen.

620
00:56:10.666 --> 00:56:12.500
Really listen to him.

621
00:56:13.666 --> 00:56:15.125
Listen with my heart.

622
00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:22.791
I've convinced him to go outside.

623
00:56:22.875 --> 00:56:24.541
I've done it once before.

624
00:56:27.541 --> 00:56:29.958
I remember he was so careful then.

625
00:56:32.083 --> 00:56:33.791
He just sat there.

626
00:56:35.958 --> 00:56:37.666
He looked up at the starry night…

627
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:43.208
Then returned to that black cave.

628
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.125
He felt safe there.

629
00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:18.250
The Pilgrims used this route.

630
00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:21.375
What did you say?

631
00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:24.166
The pilgrimage to Nidaros
and the Saint Olaf Spring.

632
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:25.375
Look here.

633
00:57:25.458 --> 00:57:29.000
If you follow the tracks of the troll.
you'll see it goes north.

634
00:57:30.625 --> 00:57:32.166
over Dovre.

635
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:35.125
straight for… Trondheim.

636
00:57:47.583 --> 00:57:48.791
We have a full tank.

637
00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.333
Good to go.

638
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:54.875
What's going on?

639
00:57:54.958 --> 00:57:56.791
The troll's pilgrimaging north.

640
00:57:57.958 --> 00:57:58.958
That's something.

641
00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:02.416
Olaf showed no mercy.

642
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.750
The age of the trolls

643
00:58:05.833 --> 00:58:06.833
was over.

644
00:58:08.791 --> 00:58:10.708
It's something my father talked about.

645
00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:14.500
Um… oh. um… He talked about
the Christianization of Norway

646
00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:16.125
and the troll massacre.

647
00:58:16.208 --> 00:58:19.625
And how Saint Olaf drove the trolls
out of the country forever.

648
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.500
In those days. Nidaros was the capital.

649
00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:28.791
It was from there
that Olaf ruled the country.

650
00:58:28.875 --> 00:58:31.291
SAINT OLAF
NIDAROS CATHEDRAL

651
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.416
He wants revenge.

652
00:59:02.708 --> 00:59:05.333
Esther Johanne Tiller.
Welcome to Trondheim.

653
00:59:05.416 --> 00:59:07.708
-Nora Tid...
-I can tell you're a Tidemann.

654
00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:10.083
You're the spitting image
of your late father.

655
00:59:10.166 --> 00:59:11.875
Is that a compliment?

656
00:59:11.958 --> 00:59:15.375
Ah… Tobias was an interesting specimen.

657
00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:18.375
He was a hoot at parties. that's for sure.

658
00:59:18.458 --> 00:59:21.667
-"Rai. rai." Andreas Isaksen.
-You're with the rest of the funky bunch.

659
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.666
We can do this all day. Disserway!

660
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:29.000
Nidaros Cathedral.

661
00:59:29.916 --> 00:59:33.625
Built approximately between 1070 and 1300.

662
00:59:34.458 --> 00:59:38.000
Until the Reformation.
it was called Cor Norvegiae.

663
00:59:38.958 --> 00:59:40.958
"The Heart of Norway."

664
00:59:42.375 --> 00:59:45.291
The Church ruled the country
from here with an iron fist.

665
00:59:45.375 --> 00:59:47.708
Well. I'm sure
you haven't come for a lecture.

666
00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:50.166
We're here to find the tomb of Saint Olaf.

667
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.125
That's all we got.

668
00:59:53.208 --> 00:59:56.625
Well. the crazy nuts
didn't fall too far from the tree.

669
00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:57.791
Disserway!

670
01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:04.875
We think the troll is coming here
to get revenge on Saint Olaf.

671
01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:06.541
-Huh.
-I read your book.

672
01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:11.242
You have a theory that Olaf's remains are
still somewhere in the cathedral. right?

673
01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.500
Folks always say. "Think outside the box."

674
01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:16.583
But sometimes the answer
lies within the box.

675
01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:19.500
Sometimes.
it's staring you smack in the kisser.

676
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.041
Take us to this box of yours.

677
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.208
Like all beautiful things in this world.

678
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:29.542
Nidaros Cathedral's underbelly
is less flattering than its exterior.

679
01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:32.416
-Disserway!
-What the heck does "Disserway" mean?

680
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.375
It means "This way." Isaksen.

681
01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:35.916
Ah. should've known.

682
01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.666
I've often asked myself.

683
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.125
"If Olaf was so important to the Church.

684
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.750
why hide him down here?"

685
01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:46.958
Yeah. That is.
unless they had a disagreement.

686
01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:48.083
Olaf and the Church.

687
01:00:49.666 --> 01:00:52.875
Yeah. Why would you hide
something you're proud of?

688
01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:55.375
Right.

689
01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:59.500
People have poked and prodded down here
until they go wonky in the noggin

690
01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:01.083
and came up with diddly squat.

691
01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:04.000
but by all means. knock yourselves out.

692
01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.333
Where should we start?

693
01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.250
The same symbol from the cave. right?

694
01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:44.208
Oh. yeah.

695
01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:47.125
When I found this room.
there was a real hullabaloo.

696
01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:50.125
Everyone thought we'd found the tomb.

697
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:54.083
Maybe he was here for a while
and then they moved his body?

698
01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.750
God only knows by whom or why.

699
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.375
Maybe it's time to get going?

700
01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:13.708
Not much more to see.

701
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.250
That's the story.

702
01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:17.458
At least that's what we know so far.

703
01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:29.208
Ah…

704
01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:38.708
-Step aside.
-Uh. sorry.

705
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:41.708
I swear I barely touched it.
I think it was already broken.

706
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.291
It's an easy fix.

707
01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.541
Step aside.

708
01:02:46.666 --> 01:02:47.833
Sorry.

709
01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:48.958
Huh?

710
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.958
A spear in the belly.

711
01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:58.083
This is…

712
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.291
Oh…

713
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:10.958
-They're his wounds.
-What do you mean. wounds?

714
01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:14.042
That's the spot where Olaf got stabbed
by Tore Hund and his gang

715
01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:15.708
during the Battle of Stiklestad.

716
01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:20.291
First a chop in the thigh.

717
01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.166
Then a spear in the belly.

718
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.583
The final one…

719
01:03:28.458 --> 01:03:31.541
A sword… in the neck.

720
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.833
There has to be something we can…

721
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.750
Here… let's try this.

722
01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:11.041
Nora. Here.

723
01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:15.041
Yeah. first… first in the thigh.

724
01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:18.083
Then. a spear in the belly.

725
01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:23.166
Catch.

726
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.750
And then. a sword to the neck.

727
01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:44.041
Hey. hey. hey!

728
01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:47.625
I'll help you.

729
01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:48.750
Okay.

730
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.916
The answer lies within the box.

731
01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.208
Staring you smack in the kisser.

732
01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.458
Look at all this water.

733
01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:58.791
Maybe this is the Olaf Spring.

734
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.708
-Okay.
-Wait!

735
01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:28.708
You can't just barge in and open it.

736
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.416
This is Olaf the Holy!

737
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.875
I mean. it… it might be.

738
01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:37.291
-We have to open it first.
-This is Olaf.

739
01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:39.208
Oh. I feel it.

740
01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:42.458
Esther. I get it.

741
01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:46.416
I respect… your respect here. I understand
the historic nature of this moment.

742
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.833
For all we know.
this grave might give us the answers.

743
01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.721
and already our time is running thin.

744
01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:53.166
Mm.

745
01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:56.625
Yeah. alright. let's do it.

746
01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:57.708
But…

747
01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:01.541
Please respect the dead. for the Church.

748
01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.666
Naturally. Of course we will.

749
01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:11.666
Oh.

750
01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:21.708
Look at my king.

751
01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.833
Hey. good-lookin'.

752
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.625
So. this is where you've been hiding?

753
01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:37.833
You old rascal. you.

754
01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:43.916
Huh? Well. that's strange…

755
01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:47.375
-What's wrong?
-It's Bæsing.

756
01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:49.541
Olaf's sword.

757
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.541
Still intact. after so many years.

758
01:07:54.583 --> 01:07:56.041
It's silver.

759
01:07:56.125 --> 01:07:58.916
Which we all know is
a useless material for weapons.

760
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.875
It's too soft.

761
01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:03.708
But still. all that aside. it won't rust.

762
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:10.541
What's this?

763
01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:14.291
-Oh. careful. Take it easy.
-Right.

764
01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:23.333
No way. that can't be.

765
01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:41.833
Time to call home.

766
01:08:42.583 --> 01:08:44.875
Can you please hold it still
for just a second?

767
01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:47.125
That's good. And down.

768
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.333
Almost…

769
01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:50.916
Got it.

770
01:08:54.333 --> 01:08:57.650
Congrats. you just finished a quest
and leveled up to the final boss.

771
01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:01.625
Look.

772
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.208
"Trolls shall not
from this land be expelled."

773
01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.833
-This changes everything.
-Hmm?

774
01:09:15.583 --> 01:09:17.958
"For all injustices
inflicted upon the Jotun.

775
01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.916
we hereby grant them their…

776
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:21.458
"Home."

777
01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:24.583
Jotunheimen.

778
01:09:24.666 --> 01:09:26.458
So he wanted to give them a home.

779
01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:27.958
Not eradicate them.

780
01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:31.375
That's the reason.
They murdered him for it.

781
01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:34.043
The Church wanted to continue
to eradicate the trolls.

782
01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.208
That means Olaf isn't the target anymore.

783
01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:44.708
He's going after
the backbone of our nation.

784
01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:47.083
It's all of us.

785
01:09:49.583 --> 01:09:53.458
Tragedy strikes again
as another troll attack shocks Norway.

786
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:56.166
After unconfirmed reports.
it became clear yesterday

787
01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.667
that a new giant monster is
on the loose in the country

788
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.583
where Hemsedal was attacked.

789
01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:04.333
Videos of the creature have circulated
widely on social media.

790
01:10:04.416 --> 01:10:06.291
Aw. how cute!

791
01:10:06.375 --> 01:10:08.500
Viewer discretion is advised.

792
01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:11.375
How can the same shit happen
to the same country twice?

793
01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.250
How many trolls do they have over there?

794
01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:16.500
If they can fake a moon landing.
you bet they can fake that troll.

795
01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:20.791
Images from Norway show
the destruction caused by the monster.

796
01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:23.750
An unlucky couple in Lesja
had their house destroyed

797
01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:25.416
by a troll for the second time.

798
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.625
There are reports
of loss of life…

799
01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.583
…both military and civilian.
Simply terrible.

800
01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:32.750
The latest
observations place the…

801
01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:36.333
…monster on the path towards
one of Norway's largest cities.

802
01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:38.625
Trondheim was our capital
a thousand years ago.

803
01:10:38.708 --> 01:10:42.166
Hm. Are we witnessing a troll king
attempting to reclaim his throne?

804
01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.000
The Norwegian Army has so far failed
in their attempts to stop the creature.

805
01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:48.792
The incident has sparked
an international outcry.

806
01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.375
If this is
a threat to the motherland.

807
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.416
we will take control of the situation.

808
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.333
Is the country of Norway
about to be plunged back

809
01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:58.416
into the Dark Ages?

810
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:07.625
The surreal events over the last
24 hours have shocked us all.

811
01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:11.500
We must also face the reality…

812
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.708
That Trondheim is lost.

813
01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:17.208
Prime Minister!

814
01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:19.500
What is the current strategy?

815
01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:23.083
Currently. we're doing everything we can
to evacuate the people of Trondheim.

816
01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.922
What's the strategy after Trondheim?

817
01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:31.666
That… uh…

818
01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:35.375
I will address that at a later time.
Thank you.

819
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.083
We've exhausted our options.

820
01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:42.125
The target broke our ranks and is set to
arrive in Trondheim in two hours. Major.

821
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:45.583
We have deployed forces to evacuate
as many people as possible.

822
01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:47.541
-Get out of there.
-Copy that.

823
01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:50.875
We can't leave now.

824
01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:53.291
No way. Can't leave yet.

825
01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.083
Okay. but Kris. if you…

826
01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:56.958
Huh?

827
01:11:57.041 --> 01:12:00.500
If we bail now. I couldn't sleep at night.
We can't let this happen.

828
01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.625
Not a chance.

829
01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.375
People…

830
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:07.958
Good people. sacrificed their lives.

831
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.375
We resist in their memory.

832
01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.291
-Okay.
-Count me in.

833
01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.333
Andreas…

834
01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:23.833
You… maybe you should…

835
01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:26.416
Yeah. you have a family to think about.

836
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.125
That's why I can't go.

837
01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.583
If Trondheim falls…

838
01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:39.250
It won't stop here.

839
01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.416
I'm staying.

840
01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:48.625
Well. I live here.

841
01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:51.916
Okay. but do we have a plan?

842
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.750
Bullets and missiles have no effect.

843
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:56.750
Church bells are effective to an extent.

844
01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:59.000
-Uh. that…
-Do we know what Olaf did back then?

845
01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.717
What weapons were used?
Other than sunshine. of course.

846
01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:04.166
Bæsing.

847
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:05.916
The silver sword?

848
01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:07.541
Would silver work?

849
01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.375
I guess.
I assume magic is infused in the silver.

850
01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:13.291
The only thing magical about silver
is it won't corrode.

851
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.403
-It can withstand water.
-That's right.

852
01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.625
Are we sure it's the silver?

853
01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:24.166
Don't look at me.
I'm not following any of this.

854
01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:49.333
-Holy water.
-Yeah.

855
01:13:49.416 --> 01:13:53.125
That's what Olaf used on the sword.
Like the nursery rhyme.

856
01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:54.791
Mm-hmm.

857
01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:57.250
Okay. I gotta say.
first of all. that's crazy.

858
01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:01.416
And second. there's not enough water
in that bird bath for this operation.

859
01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:03.083
What do we do?

860
01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:05.541
Well…

861
01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:07.916
Hm?

862
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.458
Are you guys joking right now?

863
01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:15.166
Inside that tomb. we've uncovered
one of the world's most mythical springs.

864
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.208
-That's for sure.
-The Olaf Spring.

865
01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:20.708
-We have ammo.
-We need people.

866
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.291
Game on.

867
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:26.625
Trondheim is being evacuated!

868
01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:28.666
Everyone on the buses!

869
01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:37.541
Up here!

870
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:44.333
People of Trondheim!

871
01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:46.750
A storm is raging at the edge of the city.

872
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.625
I understand how easy it is to run.

873
01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:51.875
I promise you.
the sun that set over us all tonight...

874
01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:54.167
Okay. there's a psycho-troll
right around the corner.

875
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.542
We have no time to waste.
and our plan is insane!

876
01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.416
Who will fight with us?

877
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.416
Right here! I'm down!

878
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.041
For Trondheim!

879
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.500
Great. thank you so much.

880
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:28.416
Perfect!

881
01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:33.333
Great work. guys!

882
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.166
Hurry up! Go!

883
01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.333
Alright. everyone! The enemy's moving!

884
01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:03.666
Keep up the pace! Faster. faster!

885
01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:22.583
Yes. Siggy.

886
01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:26.250
I promise. they put me on… bell duty.

887
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:28.541
-Let me call you back. okay?
-Okay.

888
01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:41.541
So. what's your take… on faith?

889
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:48.250
When my mother died.
I thought that if I could

890
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:52.791
believe in all of it hard enough.
she would watch over me from up there.

891
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:58.458
But… you can't force it.

892
01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:00.541
You have to let faith happen. So…

893
01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:04.041
I have faith she's watching.

894
01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:08.416
I also have faith in you and your plan.

895
01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.541
Although you are a little bonkers.

896
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:15.708
We're standing together
because you're our captain.

897
01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.125
It's because of you. really.

898
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:31.666
What if we fail?

899
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:37.666
It's always better to follow your heart
and fail than to go against your beliefs.

900
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.625
Yeah.

901
01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.208
You're gonna be a great papa.

902
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.000
I hope you're right.

903
01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:36.250
It has to work.

904
01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:38.250
No plan B. right?

905
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:53.500
Looks like you could use a fistful of Zen.

906
01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:55.875
What?

907
01:18:55.958 --> 01:18:58.291
I ordered your latest book and read it.

908
01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:01.125
It was a real hoot.
You should write another.

909
01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:06.000
I'm afraid nobody's a fan of sequels.

910
01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.166
Oh. that's a load of bull.

911
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.666
Everyone loves a good sequel.

912
01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:42.708
9-8. wait for my command.

913
01:19:42.791 --> 01:19:44.500
Copy that. Major.

914
01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:12.833
Okay. we're ready.

915
01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:16.000
Isaksen. alright. it's showtime. Go ahead.

916
01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:19.583
-Engage!
-Let's play these bells.

917
01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:33.791
9-8. open fire!

918
01:20:34.541 --> 01:20:36.208
Go. go. go!

919
01:21:00.083 --> 01:21:01.693
It's having an effect. He's hurt.

920
01:21:17.416 --> 01:21:18.958
Come on!

921
01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:25.958
Isaksen! Status?

922
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.875
Oh God! Run!

923
01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.583
Go. go!

924
01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:35.333
9-8. retreat!

925
01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:37.625
Get out of there. Retreat now!

926
01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.708
Come and get it.

927
01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:11.000
Oh. my God. it's working.

928
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Or not.

929
01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:22.333
Let's fall back now.

930
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.875
Fall back now!

931
01:22:26.583 --> 01:22:27.416
Run!

932
01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:35.875
Isaksen! Fall back!

933
01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.083
Beautiful…

934
01:23:08.791 --> 01:23:10.291
Monster mash.

935
01:23:48.375 --> 01:23:50.625
-Nora!
-He's killing him!

936
01:23:50.708 --> 01:23:53.333
Our weapons have no effect.
His skin is bulletproof.

937
01:23:53.416 --> 01:23:54.792
-His insides are vulnerable.
-Huh?

938
01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:58.083
It has an internal ecosystem. A heart's
pumping everything through the body.

939
01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:02.068
If we can get water inside the system so
it spreads. we can kill him from within.

940
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.169
How do we do that?

941
01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:11.208
I have an idea. If we position
the helicopter right on top of him.

942
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:13.625
we can drop the bomb
straight into his mouth!

943
01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:16.458
Isaksen. you have seen
way too many movies.

944
01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:23.416
How… how many bombs are there?

945
01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:32.000
This is the last one.

946
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.791
-Whatever we do. we do it now!
-Yeah.

947
01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:44.000
Stall him. alright?

948
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:47.916
Kris! I need a pilot!

949
01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:16.458
Ugh.

950
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:24.125
Just curious.

951
01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:27.416
what do you have in store to make
him look up and open his mouth?

952
01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:30.791
Uh… let's get up there.
and I'll improvise a plan.

953
01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:32.416
Great idea.

954
01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:51.333
-You seem lonely down here.
-More the merrier.

955
01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:05.833
No!

956
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.750
-There goes the detonator!
-Huh?

957
01:26:13.833 --> 01:26:15.500
I said we just lost the detonator!

958
01:26:24.166 --> 01:26:26.333
I have to take the chopper down.

959
01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:29.041
Isaksen! The only way
to detonate it now is manually!

960
01:26:29.625 --> 01:26:32.875
How do you do that?
Tell me how to do it manually.

961
01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:36.042
You need an explosive.
Something like this would do the trick.

962
01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:37.875
A hand grenade.

963
01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:43.909
The problem is that the pin must be pulled
right before the bomb enters his mouth.

964
01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.875
So then… someone has to jump with the bomb

965
01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:49.583
and pull the pin on the way down?

966
01:26:49.666 --> 01:26:50.666
Yeah!

967
01:27:14.291 --> 01:27:15.291
No.

968
01:27:18.791 --> 01:27:20.125
No. no!

969
01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:31.333
Get us in position.

970
01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:32.250
Isaksen.

971
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:37.625
It's time to go.

972
01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:40.291
-Nora?
-No!

973
01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:43.750
Nora! Run!

974
01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:44.833
Never!

975
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:51.041
Kris. it's now or never!

976
01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:53.125
This thing… it won't stop here!

977
01:27:53.208 --> 01:27:54.375
It's up to us!

978
01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.541
Nora!

979
01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.458
Siggy!

980
01:28:19.416 --> 01:28:21.541
-Andreas.
-Hi. honey.

981
01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:23.125
You went on a side quest?

982
01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:25.333
No. no. it's like Spock says.

983
01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:28.333
"The needs of the many…"

984
01:28:30.791 --> 01:28:32.000
Tell me you're joking.

985
01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:33.458
We're in position.

986
01:28:39.208 --> 01:28:40.958
What… what are you doing?

987
01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.291
"The needs of the many…"

988
01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:54.041
"…outweigh the needs of the few."

989
01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:02.333
Please. Siggy. tell our little miracle

990
01:29:02.416 --> 01:29:03.291
that papa was...

991
01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:16.708
That Papa…

992
01:29:32.416 --> 01:29:34.250
That Papa was…

993
01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:49.250
…Superman.

994
01:32:42.416 --> 01:32:44.291
But it doesn't end here.

995
01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:51.791
No. this fairy tale has only just begun.

996
01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:54.958
ESTHER JOHANNE TILLER
OLAF BENEATH US

997
01:32:56.208 --> 01:32:58.166
Because when something falls…

998
01:32:58.958 --> 01:33:00.750
It can rise again.

999
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.708
And when we lose someone…

1000
01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:07.750
New life springs up.

1001
01:33:07.833 --> 01:33:10.416
Yeah. Little Uhura.

1002
01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:15.791
New bonds are forged…

1003
01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:20.916
-The queen of hearts.
-…old ones grow stronger.

1004
01:33:24.166 --> 01:33:26.458
Even in the darkest of times…

1005
01:33:29.083 --> 01:33:30.458
There is hope.

1006
01:33:34.791 --> 01:33:35.791
A hope…

1007
01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:39.458
…to one day find one's family.

1008
01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:43.791
And a hope

1009
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.500
to find one's way back.

1010
01:33:47.916 --> 01:33:52.083
Back to a place where one can feel free.

1011
01:33:56.375 --> 01:33:59.333
A place to call…

1012
01:34:01.208 --> 01:34:02.416
Home.

1013
01:34:41.916 --> 01:34:44.000
Is this line secure?

1014
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:45.750
Good.

1015
01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:48.333
I have great news. General.

1016
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:52.125
The specimen I was able to save

1017
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:53.291
has. uh…

1018
01:34:54.125 --> 01:34:55.250
Developed.

1019
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.166
Well. it doesn't look like much right now.

1020
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:02.333
but. uh…

1021
01:35:03.583 --> 01:35:06.666
Just… give it some time.

1022
01:35:07.583 --> 01:35:08.458
Mm.
