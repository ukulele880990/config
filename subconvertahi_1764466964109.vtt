2
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:29.533
Just eat it.

3
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.325
It's a hamburger.

4
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.492
Drink this too.

5
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.783
Do you have somewhere to go?

6
00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:00.658
You know how to do dishes. right?

7
00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:02.263
Honey.

8
00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:05.491
I can't work for a while anyway.

9
00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:08.366
I can't give you money.

10
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.158
Instead. I'll feed you and let you sleep here.

11
00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:23.824
You're here.

12
00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:29.658
Let's just listen.

13
00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:33.200
Where did you go again?

14
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.533
You were gone for a whole week.

15
00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:37.366
It's not just a day or two.

16
00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:39.950
Why are you suddenly curious about that?

17
00:02:45.113 --> 00:02:46.075
Extermination.

18
00:02:46.558 --> 00:02:47.450
Huh?

19
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.616
I just caught some bugs.

20
00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:15.866
Give it to me.

21
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.783
So clumsy.

22
00:03:24.182 --> 00:03:25.199
Honey.

23
00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:28.033
Did you have a good trip?

24
00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:39.033
Thank you. Quickly. sit down.

25
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:47.366
Who are you?

26
00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:51.616
What are you doing?

27
00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:55.908
Let go of me!

28
00:05:16.307 --> 00:05:19.324
Help me!
Don't kick me out.

29
00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.324
Please just let me stay here.

30
00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:22.492
- I did something wron...
- It's okay.

31
00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:30.033
I just killed a bug.

32
00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:39.658
Fingernail.

33
00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:45.908
Your name is Fingernail from now on.

34
00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:01.768
Mister. what are you doing?

35
00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:03.198
What are you staring at?

36
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.033
An adult is standing. why don't you quickly get up?

37
00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:07.325
You rude jerk. where are you...

38
00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.782
Why are you burying your head in your phone and ignoring me. huh?

39
00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:12.532
Mister. I'm pregnant. This is a priority seat for pregnant women.

40
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:14.408
How much is inside your belly.

41
00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:17.366
Or if it's just grease from eating fried chicken and jokbal.

42
00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:18.532
How would I know?
Show me.

43
00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:22.033
Ah. why are you doing this?
I told you I'm pregnant!

44
00:07:22.034 --> 00:07:23.700
No. there's also a mister sitting in the pregnant women's seat over there.

45
00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:25.848
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Just. hmph!

46
00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.200
What are you staring at? Damn.

47
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.325
Girls these days.

48
00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:32.326
Don't even get married. huh?
Don't even have kids.

49
00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:35.216
And just try to suck money from men. huh?

50
00:07:35.217 --> 00:07:37.908
They only talk about being pregnant when it's convenient for them. huh?

51
00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:40.533
- What?
- Ah. please be quiet.

52
00:07:40.534 --> 00:07:41.450
What!

53
00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:43.200
'...It's on the right.'

54
00:07:43.516 --> 00:07:47.616
'Those going to Gumin Hospital
Please exit at this station.'

55
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:52.450
- Oh. I...
- Ah. is this old woman crazy. damn.

56
00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:53.950
So unlucky. damn.

57
00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.616
Sticking so close. damn. tsk.

58
00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:03.015
- I'm getting off.
- Just a moment. I'm getting off.

59
00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:04.158
Oh. really.

60
00:08:05.974 --> 00:08:07.283
- Ugh.
- Just a moment.

61
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.284
I'm sorry.

62
00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:12.783
Excuse me. Mister.

63
00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:18.367
It's not me. it's not me.

64
00:08:56.266 --> 00:08:58.224
Excuse me. sir.

65
00:08:58.225 --> 00:08:59.134
Right?

66
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.117
Hey. my son. huh?

67
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.366
You said you'd do it for him.

68
00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:05.907
- Client. you shouldn't do this.
- Please. just one more time?

69
00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:07.240
- Just a moment. let me talk.
- You can't do this here.

70
00:09:07.241 --> 00:09:08.742
No. this is Shinsung Extermination. right?!

71
00:09:08.743 --> 00:09:11.307
- Oh. no. you've come to the wrong place.
- Let me talk for a moment.

72
00:09:11.308 --> 00:09:12.491
Oh. Ms. Jo-gak.

73
00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:15.991
Sansevieria is easy to grow. I told you.

74
00:09:15.992 --> 00:09:17.700
It's great for beginners. really!

75
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.908
Ah. I really bought it because of godmother. why won't you take it?

76
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:24.950
No. it even blooms and you only water it twice a year.

77
00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:26.491
Huh?

78
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:28.783
Oh. for goodness sake.

79
00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:30.804
- Even if I say something good is good. like this...
- Oh my.

80
00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:33.950
Only people who can grow plants should grow them.

81
00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:38.158
I have a black thumb. so I'm worried it'll die. so please take it today.

82
00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.032
Cho-yeop-ah.

83
00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:42.307
You only ever see that bright red thing. huh?

84
00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:44.075
Look at this green too.

85
00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:46.782
And see other worlds too.

86
00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:49.908
It's excessive female hormones. excessive.

87
00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:53.366
And why do you take care of godmother so much?

88
00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:55.324
She's a person who doesn't even give a glance.

89
00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:58.075
How would you know?

90
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.240
- The weight of past years.
- The weight of time.

91
00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:02.158
That's right.

92
00:10:03.273 --> 00:10:05.908
Stop wearing that fake watch.

93
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:09.241
- Ugh. the quality is really bad.
- Hey. this is real.

94
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:11.073
Oh. you're here?

95
00:10:11.074 --> 00:10:12.700
- Oh. hello.
- Oh.

96
00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:15.241
Hey. Manager Son. long time no see.

97
00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:18.658
Ah. hyung-nim. shall we talk for a moment?

98
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.741
This isn't extermination. it's just

99
00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:24.200
An emotional revenge hit. isn't it?

100
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.057
No. the other party

101
00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:29.364
Is a complete scumbag who destroyed the soul of a loyal wife of 30 years.

102
00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:31.741
Eliminating such blood-sucking venomous insects.

103
00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:34.783
If that's not extermination. then what is extermination?

104
00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:37.823
Every day. pain accumulates like mileage.

105
00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:39.616
It's stacking up steadily. they say.

106
00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:42.408
Did you take anything from the client?

107
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.991
No matter how much I refused. they said to use it for a good cause. what could I do?

108
00:10:44.992 --> 00:10:46.491
They were crying and clinging.

109
00:10:49.575 --> 00:10:51.075
If we don't have this kind of funding.

110
00:10:51.076 --> 00:10:53.408
How can our Shinsung Extermination stay in business?

111
00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:56.157
- If the godmother finds out...
- Hyung-nim.

112
00:10:56.158 --> 00:10:58.782
- Flies are pests. right?
- Huh?

113
00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.158
Because they always feed on corpses and spread dirty germs.

114
00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.198
They are.

115
00:11:03.199 --> 00:11:05.239
Since the Mesozoic Era. traveling across continents.

116
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.698
Diligently spreading pollen.

117
00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.491
Maintaining the ecosystem of this Earth we live on.

118
00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:11.116
They are beneficial insects. beneficial insects.

119
00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:13.325
What if it's maggots? What if it's a cesspool?

120
00:11:13.326 --> 00:11:14.991
It becomes food for us.

121
00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:18.783
You just need to collect the ring and bring it back.

122
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:20.408
Let's pretend I didn't hear that.

123
00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:22.950
Hyung-nim.

124
00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:18.950
The surgery finished well.

125
00:13:20.783 --> 00:13:22.491
Wow. you did a difficult thing.

126
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.907
When you see injured kids. you feel pity.

127
00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.947
But actually getting your hands bloody to rescue them.

128
00:13:26.948 --> 00:13:28.450
- It's not easy.
- Then I'll be off.

129
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:29.724
Excuse me. doctor.

130
00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:32.700
But this one is such an old dog.

131
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:34.658
Shelters probably won't take him easily.

132
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.533
Adoption is also difficult.

133
00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:39.700
So. there's a high chance he'll be euthanized. you know?

134
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:43.182
So. could you please make a call yourself?

135
00:13:43.183 --> 00:13:44.116
What?

136
00:13:44.117 --> 00:13:46.783
If the person who rescued him contacts them directly. they can't refuse easily.

137
00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:49.700
Do you normally do things like this?

138
00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:53.325
Being abandoned because you're old and sick is too cruel. isn't it?

139
00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:56.099
He's already been abandoned once. right?

140
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.325
It's okay. it's okay. you'll meet a good person.

141
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.224
Just a moment.

142
00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:02.283
Stay. stay. stay. stay. just stay still.

143
00:14:04.016 --> 00:14:05.575
Yeah. Bobby. why? Bobby.

144
00:14:11.683 --> 00:14:13.991
Um. but does this hurt a lot?

145
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.950
No. I heard that. like. they just cut them open while they're alive.

146
00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:21.198
So there's no scar here.

147
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:23.658
I'll stitch it up nicely and neatly. so don't worry too much.

148
00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:26.948
Oh. save me. save me.

149
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.116
- No blood. you bastard.
- I was wrong.

150
00:14:32.683 --> 00:14:34.783
Argh. you f***ing bastard. you scared me. damn.

151
00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:36.616
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:37.683 --> 00:14:39.907
No. there's nothing to be afraid of. It's okay. it's okay.

153
00:14:39.908 --> 00:14:43.325
Are you perhaps willing to sell a cornea?

154
00:14:43.892 --> 00:14:44.782
Suddenly?

155
00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.200
This is awkward.

156
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:48.492
The client pleaded so much.

157
00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:50.892
How much for a pair?

158
00:14:50.893 --> 00:14:51.866
5.000 for a kidney.

159
00:14:51.867 --> 00:14:54.324
Including this. I'll add 3 more.

160
00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:55.950
- 3.000?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:57.475 --> 00:15:00.075
- Ha. 3.000 is a bit...
- Why. why. why?

162
00:15:01.141 --> 00:15:02.282
Look. mister.

163
00:15:02.283 --> 00:15:05.366
I'd be one-eyed for life. what can I do with 3.000?

164
00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:06.741
Huh?

165
00:15:07.183 --> 00:15:10.991
No. the price of glasses has gone up so much. why are eyes still the same as 10 years ago. huh?

166
00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:14.991
Alright. then I'll...

167
00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:17.950
I'll give you a big one. for real.

168
00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:20.608
10.

169
00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:21.490
1 billion?

170
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:22.533
10 seconds.

171
00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:24.075
To take your neck.

172
00:15:32.016 --> 00:15:33.158
You son of a bitch!

173
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.492
Argh. you bastard. my eye!

174
00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:50.738
Ah. why. why are you doing this? Ham... Who sent you?

175
00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:53.283
I heard you had an eye plucked out recently. huh?

176
00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:55.325
Scamming other people's clients.

177
00:15:55.682 --> 00:15:58.349
Did Daerim-dong. President Park. did that bastard send you?

178
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.367
Why did best friends cut in line?

179
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.449
You two will meet soon. Reconcile in hell.

180
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.407
Ah. President Park also died. died?

181
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.449
No. still. there must be a purpose for you doing this. a purpose...

182
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:10.366
Purpose?

183
00:16:10.367 --> 00:16:11.408
To become famous.

184
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.782
A lot of nerves gather here. how is it?

185
00:16:18.783 --> 00:16:19.991
Sa... Save...

186
00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:24.116
I don't know how to do that.

187
00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:26.098
The way I know is.

188
00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:29.283
Slowly and painfully.

189
00:17:07.516 --> 00:17:08.741
Where did he go?

190
00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:21.824
What is it?

191
00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:23.348
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

192
00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.740
Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop! Oh. stop!

193
00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:27.574
Okay. oh! Stop!

194
00:17:33.418 --> 00:17:35.824
You've trespassed. in someone else's business.

195
00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:38.325
Ah. you're tough. as expected.

196
00:17:38.684 --> 00:17:39.729
Did you come here because of the rumors?

197
00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:41.364
President Han. the big shot from Banpo.

198
00:17:41.366 --> 00:17:44.950
Chairman Yoon from Dongtan. and today. even President Gu. huh?

199
00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:47.075
Your hands are very skillful like this.

200
00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:50.157
Isn't it a waste to only use them for street fights?

201
00:17:50.158 --> 00:17:52.741
Ah. are you a sasaeng fan?

202
00:17:54.558 --> 00:17:55.491
Goodbye.

203
00:17:55.933 --> 00:17:58.575
Uh. uh? Wait. wait!

204
00:17:58.891 --> 00:18:01.182
Uh. uh. uh? Wait. wait. wait. wait.

205
00:18:01.183 --> 00:18:03.825
Wait. wait. let's talk. huh?

206
00:18:04.475 --> 00:18:05.783
Let's settle with this.

207
00:18:07.343 --> 00:18:09.658
It's expensive for me. are you sure?

208
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.450
Oh. why do you keep doing this when I said no?

209
00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:44.614
Why. why!

210
00:18:44.616 --> 00:18:47.033
That guy is worse than a bug. isn't he!

211
00:18:47.034 --> 00:18:48.533
Then why are you saying no!

212
00:18:48.534 --> 00:18:50.365
Oh. I understand what you're saying. but this isn't that kind of place. really.

213
00:18:50.366 --> 00:18:51.490
Why are you saying no. no?

214
00:18:51.491 --> 00:18:54.032
I'll do everything you ask. so please kill him.

215
00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.991
Oh. please go. please. ah. go...

216
00:18:57.058 --> 00:18:58.783
Oh. I can't go.

217
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.033
If I can't kill that bastard Hanseong.

218
00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.866
My son. my poor son. I can't go.

219
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.450
Please. I beg you...

220
00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:32.158
Have you eaten?

221
00:19:34.266 --> 00:19:36.074
If not. let's eat together.

222
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.783
Isn't it annoying?

223
00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:50.033
No. you just do it with the app and it's over.

224
00:19:50.034 --> 00:19:52.241
Only godmother is like this.

225
00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:56.283
Ugh. when am I going to input all of this?

226
00:19:58.016 --> 00:19:59.950
Did you clean up thoroughly?

227
00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:03.283
CCTV. witnesses. anything suspicious?

228
00:20:06.516 --> 00:20:07.533
No.

229
00:20:08.058 --> 00:20:09.783
Ah. the client is a bit much too.

230
00:20:09.784 --> 00:20:12.116
They could have done it somewhere quiet. but they had to do it where there were so many people.

231
00:20:12.117 --> 00:20:14.290
- And openly asked for extermination.
- Don't worry.

232
00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:18.574
He'll leave on his own before being called a useless eater.

233
00:20:18.575 --> 00:20:19.907
So sensitive.

234
00:20:19.908 --> 00:20:21.699
Is this the case with the woman at the entrance?

235
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.950
Ah. it's nothing much.

236
00:20:27.183 --> 00:20:29.200
I was introduced to her as Madam Hong.

237
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.866
Her son's girlfriend was scammed by drug addicts.

238
00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:34.366
Died of drug shock.

239
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:37.616
And her son went to pick her up there and was lynched. now a vegetable.

240
00:20:38.058 --> 00:20:40.908
Hmph. it's truly infuriating.

241
00:20:42.058 --> 00:20:46.908
It's delicate in many ways. so Manager Son rejected it. alright?

242
00:20:47.558 --> 00:20:50.366
And I've booked a health check-up at Jang Hospital.

243
00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:52.533
Now they say to follow procedures.

244
00:20:57.013 --> 00:20:58.908
It was overtly ostentatious. though.

245
00:20:59.433 --> 00:21:02.181
Like saying. 'Recognize me.' huh?

246
00:21:02.182 --> 00:21:06.158
Also. circling the target and gnawing away at them as much as possible.

247
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:07.950
Just before they go crazy.

248
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.807
You work in the most painful way.

249
00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:14.575
That's why your nickname is Bullfighter. huh?

250
00:21:14.576 --> 00:21:15.825
Prologue done.

251
00:21:15.826 --> 00:21:17.200
What's the main point?

252
00:21:17.558 --> 00:21:20.657
In short. instead of meaningless and unimpressive murders like that.

253
00:21:20.658 --> 00:21:24.283
He's saying we should use our good skills for justified extermination. like us.

254
00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:25.991
Extermination.

255
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.907
Is he asking me to catch bugs or something?

256
00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:30.658
That's right. cockroach-like beings that plague our society.

257
00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:32.908
To completely eradicate them.

258
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:35.616
And save those who suffer. that's our job.

259
00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:38.158
Oh my.

260
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.325
Is this the Hall of Salvation?

261
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.741
Hey. I can't just go like this.

262
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:52.699
This bastard!

263
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.408
Oh. I'll kill you before I go.

264
00:21:57.263 --> 00:21:59.991
Ah. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

265
00:22:00.808 --> 00:22:04.015
Mr. Bullfighter. if you play around. you'll get hurt.

266
00:22:04.016 --> 00:22:05.074
Whoa. whoa.

267
00:22:09.273 --> 00:22:11.950
First. I know this place is very serious.

268
00:22:18.391 --> 00:22:20.866
Uh. the kid didn't know and just played a little trick.

269
00:22:21.225 --> 00:22:22.658
Please just let it go.

270
00:22:23.183 --> 00:22:24.866
You should be more selective about who you take.

271
00:22:41.343 --> 00:22:45.366
There are many protein precipitates in your cerebrospinal fluid.

272
00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:48.408
Are your limbs trembling or anything like that recently?

273
00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:51.908
No. I'm fine.

274
00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:54.450
Looking at the color here.

275
00:22:55.058 --> 00:22:56.740
The signal denaturation is quite severe.

276
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:59.033
Please don't tell the company for now.

277
00:22:59.929 --> 00:23:01.200
That's difficult.

278
00:23:02.143 --> 00:23:04.908
Then today might be the last time we see each other.

279
00:23:09.603 --> 00:23:11.408
What's the next extermination?

280
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.533
You shouldn't overdo it.

281
00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:20.783
When was there something that wasn't overdoing it?

282
00:23:22.475 --> 00:23:25.283
Ah. stubborn old man.

283
00:23:25.766 --> 00:23:28.825
Ugh. where did you hide it?

284
00:23:31.725 --> 00:23:33.158
Ugh. damn it!

285
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.783
Just eat quietly. why are you so noisy!

286
00:23:37.784 --> 00:23:38.908
Smell.

287
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.325
Why live? Why live?

288
00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:48.783
Why did this fall out?

289
00:23:52.183 --> 00:23:53.409
Who are you!

290
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.906
Why are you doing this? I'll do anything you want!

291
00:23:56.907 --> 00:23:59.658
Those old people must have done everything you told them to too.

292
00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:00.700
Why did you kill them?

293
00:24:01.057 --> 00:24:02.282
Ah!

294
00:24:02.725 --> 00:24:04.807
That old lady Park Gyeong-bok. you mean?

295
00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:07.015
Oh. sir. boss.

296
00:24:07.016 --> 00:24:09.949
All of that was dismissed by the police. you know.

297
00:24:11.057 --> 00:24:14.449
Why didn't you just get punished by the police instead?

298
00:24:15.266 --> 00:24:16.283
Depart.

299
00:24:47.016 --> 00:24:49.366
'The train will arrive shortly...'

300
00:24:49.367 --> 00:24:50.283
Dad.

301
00:24:56.307 --> 00:24:57.365
Dad.

302
00:24:57.366 --> 00:24:58.283
Eunho.

303
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.616
I'm not Dad.

304
00:25:07.225 --> 00:25:08.992
Eunho. I'm not Dad.

305
00:25:44.558 --> 00:25:46.616
What's wrong? Huh?

306
00:25:48.392 --> 00:25:49.991
What's wrong? Making me dizzy.

307
00:25:52.683 --> 00:25:53.558
Huh?

308
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.117
You'll be forgetful too when you're my age.

309
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.156
In this accident. a woman in her 40s in the passenger car died.

310
00:26:08.157 --> 00:26:09.616
According to witness testimony.

311
00:26:09.617 --> 00:26:12.450
before the accident. a man presumed to be the suspect.

312
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:15.555
lingered around the victim's car for a while.

313
00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:18.283
The culprit stopped the car at this intersection.

314
00:26:18.284 --> 00:26:19.950
and knowing a train was coming.

315
00:26:19.951 --> 00:26:22.490
left the unconscious victim and got out alone.

316
00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:23.950
- Yes.
- Afterwards. the suspect.

317
00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:25.033
- All sorts of things happen.
- chased the witness.

318
00:26:25.034 --> 00:26:27.890
and fled after reaching the front of a nearby police station.

319
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:31.282
Police presume this case to be a murder disguised as a suicide.

320
00:26:31.283 --> 00:26:32.741
and have switched to a public investigation.

321
00:26:32.742 --> 00:26:35.658
focusing on securing the identity of the suspect.

322
00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:36.908
presumed to be in his mid-50s. Goodbye.

323
00:26:46.473 --> 00:26:48.325
You're 10 minutes early for the appointment?

324
00:26:48.641 --> 00:26:51.366
I'm someone who moves by minutes and seconds.

325
00:26:51.681 --> 00:26:53.973
Didn't Jo Du-hyeon give you prior training?

326
00:26:53.974 --> 00:26:56.574
That person is more rude than I thought...

327
00:27:02.974 --> 00:27:03.866
What is it?

328
00:27:23.697 --> 00:27:27.575
To dishonor Jang-bi Hyung-nim. who dedicated his life to disinfection. like this.

329
00:27:27.576 --> 00:27:29.700
It's not like I'm comfortable with it either.

330
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.116
Still. isn't it true that a single pebble can overturn a car?

331
00:27:33.117 --> 00:27:34.741
Rules are rules.

332
00:27:35.308 --> 00:27:37.283
- I'll get a professional.
- I'll do it.

333
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:39.866
Godmother?

334
00:27:42.725 --> 00:27:46.117
Well. if you do that. I'd be grateful.

335
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.199
Godmother. but how will you find him?

336
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.908
That guy's destination is obvious.

337
00:27:53.725 --> 00:27:55.781
Anyway. old folks require a lot of effort.

338
00:27:55.782 --> 00:27:57.075
Will it be okay?

339
00:27:58.308 --> 00:27:59.283
The...

340
00:28:00.016 --> 00:28:02.116
Weight of time.

341
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:05.616
Oh. you're here?

342
00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:06.991
Oh dear.

343
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.990
Oh. how was it? Was it okay?

344
00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:15.908
Well. I pulled out a bothersome tooth.

345
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:18.899
Doesn't look like you were waiting for me.

346
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.991
Ah. damn it!

347
00:28:23.433 --> 00:28:24.491
What is it?

348
00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:28.424
I told you to collect the ring. but you brought the whole finger.

349
00:28:28.425 --> 00:28:30.240
Check if there are 28 segments.

350
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:31.450
Manager.

351
00:28:31.849 --> 00:28:33.533
Can we talk for a moment?

352
00:28:50.633 --> 00:28:52.658
Did the Godmother come to collect me?

353
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.367
What an honor.

354
00:28:56.953 --> 00:28:57.991
Why did you do it?

355
00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:01.200
I saw Eunho.

356
00:29:01.942 --> 00:29:04.366
Eunho died. 10 years ago.

357
00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:12.241
If our Eunho hadn't met that pastor. I wouldn't have been so angry.

358
00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:14.700
The world wouldn't have made me angry.

359
00:29:15.932 --> 00:29:17.991
Then my life would have been different. right?

360
00:29:18.308 --> 00:29:20.075
I walked because there was a path.

361
00:29:20.076 --> 00:29:22.033
What's so great about living or dying?

362
00:31:40.725 --> 00:31:43.075
Just go. please!

363
00:32:00.433 --> 00:32:01.723
Kill me before you go.

364
00:32:01.724 --> 00:32:03.116
You think I can't kill you?

365
00:32:03.877 --> 00:32:04.950
You think I can't kill you!

366
00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:36.931
I told you not to get excited.

367
00:32:36.932 --> 00:32:38.908
- Your vision halves.
- Don't you know?

368
00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:42.283
Not everyone can live as coldly as you. sis!

369
00:32:42.617 --> 00:32:44.991
You ruined the job by being swayed by emotions.

370
00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:46.991
So you die according to the rules.

371
00:32:53.533 --> 00:32:56.783
Sorry. but I was going to quit after this one!

372
00:32:56.784 --> 00:33:00.075
I was going to open a chicken shop and live by tending to flowers!

373
00:33:00.076 --> 00:33:01.658
So... Ugh!

374
00:33:07.225 --> 00:33:09.200
Ah. I thought I was going to die of boredom.

375
00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:11.825
What are you?

376
00:33:12.933 --> 00:33:13.991
Who are you?

377
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.700
We must have met before.

378
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:19.190
Move. this is my business.

379
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:20.241
It's my business too.

380
00:33:27.016 --> 00:33:28.806
Did Manager Son send you?

381
00:33:28.807 --> 00:33:29.698
To the Lighthouse?

382
00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:32.991
If you had done your job properly. I wouldn't have had to step in like this.

383
00:33:35.516 --> 00:33:36.658
They called you a legend.

384
00:33:37.142 --> 00:33:39.325
but your hair is gray and you have wrinkles.

385
00:33:39.326 --> 00:33:40.908
How can you be so old already?

386
00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:42.491
Shut up.

387
00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:48.699
I don't need it. Lighthouse or whatever.

388
00:33:49.816 --> 00:33:51.116
Then you can finish up yourself.

389
00:33:52.099 --> 00:33:53.408
Since it's your job.

390
00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:58.158
When it's time to go.

391
00:33:59.432 --> 00:34:02.158
they say the person you missed will come to meet you.

392
00:34:02.891 --> 00:34:03.991
My daughter.

393
00:34:05.183 --> 00:34:06.408
said it's enough.

394
00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:11.324
and came to meet me. saying Dad did enough.

395
00:34:21.683 --> 00:34:23.116
Hey. ah...

396
00:35:06.586 --> 00:35:09.283
The call is not being answered. After the beep. please leave a message...

397
00:35:18.183 --> 00:35:20.616
Sir. he's not answering again.

398
00:35:20.933 --> 00:35:23.532
- Let's just go.
- No. I'll finish the job and go.

399
00:35:23.533 --> 00:35:25.200
What if something happened?

400
00:35:25.516 --> 00:35:27.574
He hasn't answered the phone all day.

401
00:36:28.058 --> 00:36:29.158
Never.

402
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:32.283
I told you not to hold back with the blade.

403
00:36:32.284 --> 00:36:33.825
- No matter who the opponent is.
- No matter who the opponent is.

404
00:36:33.826 --> 00:36:36.825
You're getting soft by listening to others. so this is what happens.

405
00:36:38.308 --> 00:36:39.241
Remember.

406
00:36:41.057 --> 00:36:42.783
Don't shoot a butterfly with a gun.

407
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.283
What!

408
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.658
Let's go now.

409
00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.366
Don't move. I've given you temporary treatment...

410
00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:31.698
What's the trick?

411
00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:33.533
I heard a sudden brake and saw.

412
00:38:34.432 --> 00:38:36.616
A car was stopped by the roadside.

413
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:39.449
I checked just in case. and the elder was there.

414
00:38:40.516 --> 00:38:44.158
They fainted. saying absolutely no to the hospital.

415
00:38:45.975 --> 00:38:49.365
It's an 8cm laceration. including a stab wound to the right latissimus dorsi.

416
00:38:49.366 --> 00:38:51.449
but it's near organs. so if it were a little deeper.

417
00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:53.825
you wouldn't be seeing me now.

418
00:38:55.141 --> 00:38:58.449
Please forgive me for cutting your clothes with scissors. as the blood was sticking everywhere.

419
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.492
My belongings?

420
00:39:00.516 --> 00:39:01.824
I've kept them safe.

421
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.117
You shouldn't do this. You're already bleeding heavily...

422
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:12.866
Ha. come on. just bear with it for a bit.

423
00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:40.825
Today's work.

424
00:39:46.058 --> 00:39:47.658
everyone has their own story.

425
00:39:55.183 --> 00:39:57.200
Nurses will be in soon. Wear this.

426
00:39:57.766 --> 00:39:59.116
I'll get you some medicine too.

427
00:40:43.373 --> 00:40:44.783
You're a bit late?

428
00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.575
They put the Lighthouse on it.

429
00:40:53.516 --> 00:40:54.408
Why?

430
00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:56.617
Did you not trust me?

431
00:40:58.474 --> 00:41:00.283
Ah. the waves are high.

432
00:41:00.974 --> 00:41:03.408
It would be a big problem if our Godmother got swept away.

433
00:41:04.266 --> 00:41:07.283
You're a precious asset of Sinseong Disinfection.

434
00:41:07.766 --> 00:41:09.450
Wow. this is like this.

435
00:41:10.141 --> 00:41:11.324
Why isn't the knife sharp?

436
00:41:20.101 --> 00:41:22.491
This knife looks a bit dull.

437
00:41:29.823 --> 00:41:32.200
but it still seems quite usable.

438
00:41:37.183 --> 00:41:38.408
Looking at the situation.

439
00:41:38.808 --> 00:41:42.408
it seems like you're just picking up anyone off the street and making them do this and that.

440
00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:46.866
Our work is a sacred task of eradicating malignant pests.

441
00:41:47.183 --> 00:41:50.241
For example. taking ordinary kids and swindling them.

442
00:41:50.242 --> 00:41:53.765
and then disinfecting those drug addicts who drove them to death.

443
00:41:53.766 --> 00:41:57.158
The jobs you refuse. that's our job.

444
00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:02.365
Ah. this is so frustrating.

445
00:42:02.366 --> 00:42:05.158
They are nationwide mafia.

446
00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:07.531
It's like a fugu poison sac where everyone dies if you touch it wrong.

447
00:42:07.532 --> 00:42:08.991
So what do you expect me to do?

448
00:42:09.983 --> 00:42:12.532
You work so comfortably. weighing and picking.

449
00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:13.865
It's my authority.

450
00:42:13.866 --> 00:42:15.795
Authority comes with responsibility.

451
00:42:15.796 --> 00:42:17.823
Then why don't you try it yourself!

452
00:42:17.824 --> 00:42:19.033
There's nothing I can't do.

453
00:42:25.783 --> 00:42:29.239
And Toro. he's a clean guy. even if you check him thoroughly.

454
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.866
He's skilled.

455
00:42:31.808 --> 00:42:34.574
Now. acknowledge him as a colleague and buy him a meal. huh?

456
00:42:34.575 --> 00:42:37.283
Now that I see it. your father was very young.

457
00:42:37.891 --> 00:42:40.033
Was that when you were just a snot-nosed kid?

458
00:42:41.016 --> 00:42:41.908
Yes.

459
00:42:42.475 --> 00:42:45.533
At that time. Godmother was also in her prime. right!

460
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.700
Why are you leaving already? You just got here. stay a bit longer.

461
00:43:04.058 --> 00:43:05.491
Don't you plan to grow your fingernails?

462
00:43:07.266 --> 00:43:08.116
What?

463
00:43:09.266 --> 00:43:12.324
You used to be flashy. Paint them. do something.

464
00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.200
Why?

465
00:43:16.308 --> 00:43:18.908
Should I tear your face to shreds?

466
00:43:25.516 --> 00:43:27.241
You must have something to do before that.

467
00:43:28.683 --> 00:43:31.450
You lay there like a dog and received treatment.

468
00:43:32.266 --> 00:43:33.158
Then...

469
00:43:34.225 --> 00:43:36.367
You left a witness there.

470
00:43:37.975 --> 00:43:41.408
If the company finds out. won't you end up like Jang-bi?

471
00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:47.950
Now I know who you are.

472
00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:51.575
You know?

473
00:43:52.058 --> 00:43:53.307
Me?

474
00:43:53.308 --> 00:43:54.200
I know.

475
00:43:55.808 --> 00:43:57.241
The guy who's trying hard to die.

476
00:44:02.183 --> 00:44:04.408
Yeah. even if you're past your prime.

477
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.450
they say you're done for if you get on Godmother's bad side. right?

478
00:44:08.392 --> 00:44:10.450
There aren't just one or two contractors who follow her.

479
00:44:12.475 --> 00:44:15.557
So don't show up in front of me. okay?

480
00:44:15.558 --> 00:44:17.075
If you want to live long.

481
00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:27.116
Why don't you be more selective about who you take on?

482
00:44:30.641 --> 00:44:33.533
I'll handle it myself. Godmother. okay?

483
00:44:35.975 --> 00:44:39.724
Where is this crazy bastard. trying to die?

484
00:44:39.725 --> 00:44:42.224
Alright. if it's not money. and it's not justice.

485
00:44:42.225 --> 00:44:44.950
then what on earth is your purpose for being here. huh?

486
00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:47.324
Legend.

487
00:44:51.058 --> 00:44:53.825
You came to the right place. your eyes are good!

488
00:46:50.033 --> 00:46:52.075
"A child left alone after their father's death."

489
00:46:52.825 --> 00:46:54.450
"From orphanage to psychiatric hospital."

490
00:47:06.849 --> 00:47:08.866
What should I do with you now?

491
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.240
Don't pick at your side dishes. okay. Haeni?

492
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:51.657
Yes. sir! You do well. Dad.

493
00:47:51.658 --> 00:47:54.325
- Alright. have a good trip.
- Jiwoo. Kim Jiwoo.

494
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.032
Hey. aren't you going to clean that up?

495
00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:18.199
- Yes. I'm sorry.
- Apologize.

496
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.990
- Apologize for what. this person is really...
- Apologize!

497
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:21.699
Someone who knows better. why are you doing this. really!

498
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.031
Ugh. really. stop it!

499
00:48:24.032 --> 00:48:25.408
I told you to apologize!

500
00:48:33.765 --> 00:48:36.366
- Hello.
- Oh. yes.

501
00:48:42.765 --> 00:48:45.324
Oh. welcome!

502
00:48:47.016 --> 00:48:50.699
These peaches just came out. they're as sweet as honey.

503
00:48:51.016 --> 00:48:53.515
- Shall we go with that?
- Ah. how many should I give you?

504
00:48:53.516 --> 00:48:55.683
Ah. 4 is enough?

505
00:48:55.684 --> 00:48:56.615
That's a bit many?

506
00:48:56.616 --> 00:49:00.783
Oh. when you start eating. 4 goes by quickly.

507
00:49:01.766 --> 00:49:04.574
She's 7. but her skills are good. right?

508
00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:05.533
Yes.

509
00:49:06.725 --> 00:49:08.640
Her mom must be an angel.

510
00:49:08.641 --> 00:49:11.492
Yes. she's in heaven.

511
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.699
How did...

512
00:49:14.058 --> 00:49:16.075
Her surgery relapsed.

513
00:49:16.076 --> 00:49:19.907
She was bedridden for 5 years and then just passed away meaninglessly.

514
00:49:19.908 --> 00:49:23.031
After that incident. our son-in-law can't sleep at night.

515
00:49:23.032 --> 00:49:25.740
So he just goes around working night shifts everywhere.

516
00:49:25.741 --> 00:49:28.949
And he does that one-person protest or whatever. that makes no sense.

517
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.115
He's been doing that for years.

518
00:49:31.116 --> 00:49:32.682
He says it's...

519
00:49:32.683 --> 00:49:35.741
Courtesy to the dead or something...

520
00:49:37.433 --> 00:49:39.158
Oh dear. I'm talking nonsense again...

521
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:45.283
I'll give you another one of these overripe peaches.

522
00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:48.491
People don't buy them if they're a bit bruised. but this one's even tastier.

523
00:49:48.492 --> 00:49:51.074
It's really delicious.

524
00:49:51.933 --> 00:49:54.450
- I'll enjoy it.
- Come again.

525
00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:00.947
Oh. Haeni? Dad's here!

526
00:50:00.948 --> 00:50:02.783
- Huh?
- Haeni.

527
00:50:03.558 --> 00:50:07.281
Dad! Why are you so late?

528
00:50:07.282 --> 00:50:08.282
Uh. did you eat?

529
00:50:08.283 --> 00:50:10.449
Yes. I missed you.

530
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.533
Haeni. just a moment.

531
00:51:16.475 --> 00:51:18.908
Sir. sir!

532
00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:07.783
Sir.

533
00:52:25.224 --> 00:52:26.533
Why did you come?

534
00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.950
Our family has nothing to do with it.

535
00:52:29.891 --> 00:52:30.824
Why?

536
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.200
Huh?

537
00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:36.366
You must have seen what I carry around?

538
00:52:38.433 --> 00:52:39.908
You're a good person.

539
00:52:41.016 --> 00:52:42.491
You saved an abandoned child.

540
00:52:43.225 --> 00:52:44.658
I'm not a good person.

541
00:52:45.433 --> 00:52:47.491
That's an answer only a good person could give.

542
00:52:54.058 --> 00:52:55.199
Is Muyong doing well?

543
00:52:56.516 --> 00:52:57.449
Muyong?

544
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.325
Because he seemed like a brave child. I just...

545
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.825
You really have no talent for naming things.

546
00:53:09.058 --> 00:53:10.450
Why don't you go to the hospital?

547
00:53:12.516 --> 00:53:14.283
Afraid of getting fired? From the company?

548
00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:17.450
Must be a scary company if you're 'afraid of getting fired'.

549
00:53:18.808 --> 00:53:21.075
Then if your wound gets worse. make sure to stop by my place.

550
00:53:21.725 --> 00:53:24.158
And go for walks with Muyong more often.

551
00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.615
I'm not sure what to call you.

552
00:53:34.616 --> 00:53:35.866
By any chance. your name is...

553
00:54:17.516 --> 00:54:20.033
Do you also think I'm a good person?

554
00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:22.116
Muyong.

555
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:26.116
Yes. from today. your name is Muyong.

556
00:54:33.575 --> 00:54:37.158
This prime land has been here for over 40 years already.

557
00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:40.849
How great would it be to tear it all down and build anew?

558
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:42.742
But it's not as easy as it sounds. is it?

559
00:54:43.183 --> 00:54:46.033
In front of herbivores born in this state.

560
00:54:47.308 --> 00:54:50.973
there's an old lion stubbornly holding its ground.

561
00:54:50.974 --> 00:54:53.283
It seemed like all his claws had fallen out. why?

562
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.740
Has he never made a mistake while hunting until now?

563
00:54:56.741 --> 00:54:59.407
It was perfect. Unbelievably so.

564
00:54:59.408 --> 00:55:03.323
Like a legend that's both adored and feared.

565
00:55:03.324 --> 00:55:06.575
Those humans. huh? They can't stand that.

566
00:55:08.266 --> 00:55:10.491
Oh. what on earth happened?

567
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:15.265
There was an original gentleman named Ryu who first laid the foundation here.

568
00:55:15.266 --> 00:55:16.450
Oh. this bastard.

569
00:55:16.451 --> 00:55:19.075
I'm late because I came back from performing the 49th-day memorial service.

570
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:23.742
Just in case our family couldn't leave this world.

571
00:55:35.016 --> 00:55:37.491
On that person's death anniversary. to get revenge.

572
00:55:37.492 --> 00:55:41.783
she disinfected 28 people all by herself.

573
00:55:44.325 --> 00:55:45.658
Our Godmother.

574
00:55:53.891 --> 00:55:57.366
After that day. she even changed her name from 'Fingernail' to 'Fragment'.

575
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.950
But when was that. anyway?

576
00:56:08.808 --> 00:56:11.950
Expired waste should be disposed of. shouldn't it?

577
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:26.991
Guardian.

578
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:29.682
Hello. Grandma.

579
00:56:29.683 --> 00:56:30.700
Oh. hello.

580
00:56:31.183 --> 00:56:33.116
You came out for a walk with Muyong.

581
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.615
Can I play with them?

582
00:56:35.616 --> 00:56:37.324
- Yes. of course.
- Haeni.

583
00:56:37.325 --> 00:56:39.283
- Wow.
- Here.

584
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.323
Muyong. let's go.

585
00:56:41.324 --> 00:56:43.783
- Haeni. don't go too far.
- Yes.

586
00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.158
The child is very...

587
00:56:48.184 --> 00:56:49.742
She seems smart.

588
00:56:51.866 --> 00:56:53.325
She takes a lot after her mother.

589
00:56:56.575 --> 00:56:58.367
Did you hear that? To my mother-in-law.

590
00:57:00.933 --> 00:57:02.950
A perfectly healthy person. overnight...

591
00:57:05.391 --> 00:57:06.824
The hospital director told me.

592
00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:09.449
Anyone trying to profit.

593
00:57:09.808 --> 00:57:12.783
at first. they all talk about sincere apologies and whatnot. really.

594
00:57:15.433 --> 00:57:17.908
At that time. hah...

595
00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:19.908
Should I have just bitten my tongue off?

596
00:57:20.475 --> 00:57:22.533
Or as much as I wanted to. I just...

597
00:57:23.142 --> 00:57:24.283
Do you want to kill them?

598
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:37.948
Would you like to have a meal together?

599
00:57:37.949 --> 00:57:40.158
We were already on our way to lunch.

600
00:57:42.866 --> 00:57:45.366
No. I just... Oh. you're here?

601
00:57:45.866 --> 00:57:49.533
Let's go together. We're all just trying to make a living.

602
00:57:50.432 --> 00:57:52.866
Sorry. Grandma. I have to go.

603
00:57:54.267 --> 00:57:58.658
Please. let's go together.

604
00:57:59.807 --> 00:58:03.449
I have a presentation next week. Grandma. you should come too.

605
00:58:04.016 --> 00:58:07.490
Oh dear? I can't go to places like that.

606
00:58:07.491 --> 00:58:10.574
No! I practiced my dance really hard!

607
00:58:10.575 --> 00:58:12.699
Haeni. why are you like this today?

608
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.349
You don't need to worry about it.

609
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.283
Eat quickly.

610
00:58:19.724 --> 00:58:20.658
Fragment.

611
00:58:22.266 --> 00:58:23.200
Fragment?

612
00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:24.908
My name.

613
00:58:28.157 --> 00:58:29.700
One fragment. two fragments...

614
00:58:29.701 --> 00:58:32.700
- Three fragments. four fragments... - Haeni. tsk.

615
00:58:34.474 --> 00:58:36.574
It means 'beast's claw'.

616
00:58:37.683 --> 00:58:40.574
- Oh. was it? I didn't know. - Look here.

617
00:58:40.575 --> 00:58:43.598
Haeni. I told you not to do that without adult permission.

618
00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:45.533
Look at this. it came out well. right?

619
00:58:46.308 --> 00:58:49.116
- Give me your number. I'll send it to you. - Haeni!

620
00:58:52.658 --> 00:58:53.991
Ah. I'm sorry.

621
00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:58.866
Oh no. Dad. what about that?

622
00:58:58.867 --> 00:59:01.199
Someone must have broken it and ran away.

623
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.908
Isn't that really expensive?

624
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.492
Oh. hello.

625
00:59:16.766 --> 00:59:17.824
How did you come?

626
00:59:22.433 --> 00:59:24.200
An old hunting dog...

627
00:59:25.891 --> 00:59:27.366
There's one.

628
00:59:28.766 --> 00:59:30.491
It's doing things it wouldn't normally do.

629
00:59:32.807 --> 00:59:33.866
Why is that?

630
00:59:34.598 --> 00:59:35.533
Huh?

631
00:59:44.725 --> 00:59:46.992
Like being swayed by trivial things.

632
00:59:49.141 --> 00:59:50.533
Or becoming cowardly.

633
00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.240
Or coveting things it didn't eat before.

634
00:59:57.241 --> 01:00:00.991
Ah. if it's psychosomatic. I think you've come to the wrong place.

635
01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:05.450
- This is a hospital. - Because it's an animal hospital.

636
01:00:05.933 --> 01:00:07.200
Humans too.

637
01:00:08.224 --> 01:00:09.283
Animals.

638
01:00:11.057 --> 01:00:12.116
Aren't they?

639
01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:15.699
That's true. but I can't treat people.

640
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.783
That's strange.

641
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.325
I thought you treated people too.

642
01:00:29.033 --> 01:00:30.281
Hello.

643
01:00:30.282 --> 01:00:31.491
Oh. Kkangchi's mother.

644
01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:34.534
- He's not eating. - Oh dear. that must be tough.

645
01:00:34.535 --> 01:00:35.908
- Come in. - Yes.

646
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:38.616
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

647
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:50.907
Oh. Mother. strawberries. I want strawberries!

648
01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:53.408
Oh. strawberries are already out of season.

649
01:00:55.183 --> 01:00:56.616
What about this Hallabong?

650
01:00:57.058 --> 01:00:59.657
This California orange is sweeter.

651
01:00:59.658 --> 01:01:00.949
How is this sweeter?

652
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:02.157
Mister. this.

653
01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:04.824
I have a presentation next week. please come!

654
01:01:04.825 --> 01:01:06.699
Oh dear? Uncle is a bit busy.

655
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:11.283
No! I practiced my dance really. really hard!

656
01:01:11.724 --> 01:01:13.741
- Really? Then let's see. - Oh. good job.

657
01:01:18.033 --> 01:01:20.950
- Oh. you're good. - Oh. she's good.

658
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.741
The owner of Haeni Fresh Produce is very clever.

659
01:01:28.742 --> 01:01:29.949
What are you doing?

660
01:01:30.475 --> 01:01:33.491
No. these are old. wrinkled. and bruised.

661
01:01:33.492 --> 01:01:34.890
But they taste the same.

662
01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.241
People don't know and just buy pretty. fresh ones. they say?

663
01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:38.825
Mr. Kang's family.

664
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.741
If you touch even a hair on them...

665
01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.116
Are you serious?

666
01:01:48.183 --> 01:01:49.325
Wow. that scholar is quite talented.

667
01:01:53.183 --> 01:01:55.200
Melting even an icy person.

668
01:01:55.975 --> 01:01:57.950
I'll leave. so stop it.

669
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.658
What?

670
01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:04.617
If only I'm gone. there will be no threat to Shinseong Disinfection.

671
01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:08.741
and that innocent person will be safe.

672
01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.241
I don't want to.

673
01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:15.867
How can you put down your knife just for that one person.

674
01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:19.075
and dream of retirement or a normal life or whatever?

675
01:02:19.076 --> 01:02:21.783
What. as you get older. what happens?

676
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:24.783
Like bacteria seeping into cracked skin. something strange invades?

677
01:02:24.784 --> 01:02:28.240
Compassion. guilt. what...

678
01:02:28.241 --> 01:02:30.533
What. the desire to protect...

679
01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:33.075
What. are those feelings welling up. or what?

680
01:02:35.225 --> 01:02:37.992
What is your purpose for being here. huh?

681
01:02:43.516 --> 01:02:44.449
Purpose?

682
01:02:45.475 --> 01:02:47.158
It's funny how people are.

683
01:02:48.641 --> 01:02:52.033
They don't know where they're going themselves. but they pry into where others are going.

684
01:02:54.683 --> 01:02:56.866
Do you even know where you're going right now?

685
01:03:01.016 --> 01:03:02.075
Well. anyway.

686
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:05.867
What does age matter. huh?

687
01:03:07.516 --> 01:03:09.491
You have the freedom to look as much as you want.

688
01:03:12.183 --> 01:03:13.450
But you don't have the right. do you?

689
01:03:19.391 --> 01:03:21.158
Hey. huh?

690
01:03:21.975 --> 01:03:23.992
Who would buy this for the same money?

691
01:04:21.975 --> 01:04:23.367
Go inside and rest.

692
01:04:25.225 --> 01:04:26.367
I'm fine.

693
01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:32.950
I'll look into a new ID and ticket for you.

694
01:04:34.225 --> 01:04:35.491
I don't need it.

695
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.867
I will stay where I want to be.

696
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.533
Do as you please.

697
01:04:44.575 --> 01:04:45.783
But from now on.

698
01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:47.783
neither you nor I

699
01:04:49.391 --> 01:04:51.616
should create anything to protect.

700
01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:24.658
It's already been 10 years. You've worked hard.

701
01:05:28.016 --> 01:05:30.116
Use that to protect Shinseong Disinfection well.

702
01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:02.866
Oh my!

703
01:06:05.808 --> 01:06:07.449
- No. what... - Oh. oh. what is it?

704
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.929
Hey. what are you?

705
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.783
Ugh. why is it like this today?

706
01:06:13.183 --> 01:06:15.408
- Oh. Director. Director! - Director. Director!

707
01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:18.408
Director. what's wrong?

708
01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:19.847
Just a moment.

709
01:06:19.848 --> 01:06:21.199
- What do we do? - Director!

710
01:06:24.141 --> 01:06:25.699
To the emergency room!

711
01:06:27.225 --> 01:06:28.783
- To the hospital quickly! - Are you okay?

712
01:06:54.116 --> 01:06:55.807
Is the grudge deep?

713
01:06:55.808 --> 01:06:57.908
To hit him in front of a child.

714
01:06:57.909 --> 01:06:58.950
Well.

715
01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:03.366
the client's condition is confidentiality. so I can't really tell you...

716
01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:08.824
Why leave Tuu. that obedient guy. and why...

717
01:07:11.366 --> 01:07:14.075
did you specifically choose a female contractor. the same age as the victim.

718
01:07:14.076 --> 01:07:16.658
that I have to ask you directly?

719
01:07:17.225 --> 01:07:19.950
Rather than someone else stepping in and making a mess.

720
01:07:19.951 --> 01:07:22.325
it's better for Godmother to clean it up neatly...

721
01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.866
Huh? What. damn.

722
01:07:47.158 --> 01:07:48.450
Who is the client?

723
01:07:49.808 --> 01:07:51.866
Oh. Godmother.

724
01:07:52.225 --> 01:07:54.283
Why are you doing this to me!

725
01:07:59.616 --> 01:08:01.616
Why was Kang Bong-hoe targeted?

726
01:08:02.475 --> 01:08:05.617
Anyone who pries gets an instant execution.

727
01:08:05.932 --> 01:08:07.991
That's the rule you made. Godmother.

728
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:15.991
That wasn't made to catch fish.

729
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.408
It's to catch the ocean.

730
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:25.533
You don't even know where the ship is going.

731
01:08:28.308 --> 01:08:32.075
The hospital director's son said Kang Bong-hoe killed his mother.

732
01:08:32.076 --> 01:08:33.575
So he wants revenge.

733
01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:36.099
And he gave us a lot of money.

734
01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.783
Kang Bong-hoe is not that kind of person.

735
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:40.849
It is strange.

736
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.408
He said he was the hospital director's son. but he was wearing a fake watch.

737
01:08:43.975 --> 01:08:45.283
Ugh!

738
01:08:45.284 --> 01:08:48.307
Chief Son said we should just take it because it's money.

739
01:08:48.308 --> 01:08:49.616
but just in case.

740
01:08:53.058 --> 01:08:54.366
I did some background checks.

741
01:08:55.391 --> 01:08:57.532
Maid Cheon? This is where she plays. you son of a bitch!

742
01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.365
Let's see how much guts you have!

743
01:08:59.366 --> 01:09:02.156
- Is this guy bluffing? - Damn. are you scared. are you scared?

744
01:09:02.157 --> 01:09:04.782
Damn. are you gonna do it or quit. you bastard?

745
01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:06.115
All in. you bastard!

746
01:09:06.116 --> 01:09:10.324
Ah. you damn son of a bitch. really a dog

747
01:09:12.975 --> 01:09:15.408
Ah. who is this bastard? Ah. hey!

748
01:09:17.266 --> 01:09:20.074
Kang Bong-hoe. why did you ask to be killed?

749
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.283
Who?

750
01:09:24.933 --> 01:09:27.240
Ah. I really don't know. I really don't know.

751
01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:28.948
I just did what I was told after getting paid.

752
01:09:28.949 --> 01:09:30.140
By whom?

753
01:09:30.141 --> 01:09:34.115
I. I. I did it by phone. by phone. call. call.

754
01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:35.782
There's a phone in my back pocket. right?

755
01:09:35.783 --> 01:09:38.033
- Uh. make a call. - Yes.

756
01:09:42.433 --> 01:09:43.407
Oh. why?

757
01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:46.156
Ah. yes. some woman is...

758
01:09:46.157 --> 01:09:47.075
Granny.

759
01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:50.325
I don't think you should be playing with the scraps over there right now.

760
01:09:51.683 --> 01:09:53.075
What do you want?

761
01:09:53.433 --> 01:09:54.741
Equal destruction?

762
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:58.492
It's almost Mr. Kang's quitting time.

763
01:09:58.807 --> 01:10:00.616
What. should I help you again this time?

764
01:10:33.016 --> 01:10:34.866
Just a moment. just a moment.

765
01:10:35.641 --> 01:10:36.741
Ah. thank you.

766
01:10:43.266 --> 01:10:44.283
Are you okay?

767
01:11:17.016 --> 01:11:18.866
- Oh. be careful. oh my. - Are you okay?

768
01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:37.741
Teacher! No. teacher!

769
01:12:10.183 --> 01:12:12.325
Please don't leave me alone.

770
01:12:20.391 --> 01:12:21.949
I'm sorry.

771
01:12:32.433 --> 01:12:33.616
How did you know to come here?

772
01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:36.283
- That's a relief. - Yes?

773
01:12:47.974 --> 01:12:50.033
You don't have to worry about us.

774
01:12:52.266 --> 01:12:53.241
No. it's not.

775
01:13:00.949 --> 01:13:01.949
Excuse me.

776
01:13:04.808 --> 01:13:06.242
Just to me.

777
01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.617
don't you have anything to say?

778
01:13:13.225 --> 01:13:14.616
You've gotten a little thinner.

779
01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:16.908
Be sure to eat your meals.

780
01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.408
How is it? Does your heart beat a little?

781
01:13:35.599 --> 01:13:37.491
Why are you making it so complicated?

782
01:13:38.558 --> 01:13:42.075
It's useless if you don't think for yourself.

783
01:13:43.016 --> 01:13:46.366
Go and take care of it now. why are you doing this in front of me?

784
01:13:47.557 --> 01:13:48.533
Yeah. right.

785
01:13:50.558 --> 01:13:52.741
I just want to see a legendary ending. I guess.

786
01:13:56.183 --> 01:13:59.116
- You must be disappointed. - I am disappointed.

787
01:13:59.766 --> 01:14:00.866
In myself.

788
01:14:02.975 --> 01:14:05.741
Because I've wandered my whole life trying to find this kind of crappy thing.

789
01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:06.783
Stop it.

790
01:14:07.766 --> 01:14:09.783
If it were me. you've already found it.

791
01:14:12.558 --> 01:14:13.450
No.

792
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.742
I haven't found it yet.

793
01:14:18.183 --> 01:14:20.140
The real match isn't this.

794
01:14:20.141 --> 01:14:23.098
Retirement? Don't even dream of it. and.

795
01:14:23.099 --> 01:14:24.908
you can never beat me.

796
01:14:26.891 --> 01:14:28.825
Because you have something to protect.

797
01:14:29.558 --> 01:14:31.033
and I have nothing to lose.

798
01:14:33.183 --> 01:14:34.531
Welcome.

799
01:14:34.532 --> 01:14:36.700
- Oh. this place is so nice! - Shall we sit here?

800
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.700
- The scent is so good. - I can't wait any longer.

801
01:15:06.141 --> 01:15:07.449
Daughter. no.

802
01:15:09.558 --> 01:15:11.783
Two sons. no.

803
01:15:14.183 --> 01:15:16.241
98. 99.

804
01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.491
No.

805
01:15:36.308 --> 01:15:39.241
Ah. the one who was supposed to start working today...

806
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.200
Hello.

807
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.367
Allergy.

808
01:16:06.433 --> 01:16:07.433
Give me water.

809
01:16:08.475 --> 01:16:10.033
Uh. dinner is...

810
01:16:10.516 --> 01:16:11.533
It's fine.

811
01:16:16.266 --> 01:16:17.865
When does your father come home?

812
01:16:17.866 --> 01:16:21.033
He comes after 12. There are many days he doesn't come home.

813
01:16:37.033 --> 01:16:38.241
How long has it been?

814
01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:40.575
Ten days?

815
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.617
Aren't you tired?

816
01:16:46.433 --> 01:16:48.283
Ah. hey. what the.

817
01:16:48.683 --> 01:16:51.325
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up right away.

818
01:16:58.433 --> 01:17:00.240
Oh. what the.

819
01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.699
Who untied all my shoelaces?

820
01:17:19.016 --> 01:17:21.491
You're aiming for my back of the head.

821
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:40.991
Listen carefully.

822
01:17:40.992 --> 01:17:43.783
If I don't come back. you're going out that way.

823
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:47.742
Don't foolishly wait and starve to death.

824
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.116
Find a new owner. or rummage through trash cans.

825
01:17:52.141 --> 01:17:53.783
Survive somehow.

826
01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:04.866
Just don't get caught by the dog catcher.

827
01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.325
Are you saying Han-seong will attack that guy's hideout?

828
01:18:15.933 --> 01:18:19.182
I'm going to do what Shinseong Disinfection. as I know it. does.

829
01:18:19.183 --> 01:18:21.574
Killing bugs and saving sick people.

830
01:18:21.575 --> 01:18:23.033
That Hong Yeo-sa case.

831
01:18:23.034 --> 01:18:26.724
it's not something that will end by disinfecting one drug addict.

832
01:18:26.725 --> 01:18:30.182
Why don't you just deal with easy stuff like a veterinarian

833
01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:33.616
and why are you making a fuss about stirring up a hornet's nest again?

834
01:18:34.225 --> 01:18:37.533
It's a real war. If you mess with that.

835
01:18:39.391 --> 01:18:42.949
even if it's Godmother. it's hard to do it alone.

836
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.823
This is my last disinfection in my life.

837
01:18:44.824 --> 01:18:48.741
Whether I live or die. I'll disappear. so this is your responsibility from now on.

838
01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:52.492
If you're so worried about me. attach a lighthouse.

839
01:18:52.932 --> 01:18:54.908
That guy. Tuu.

840
01:18:57.433 --> 01:19:00.950
Oh. you suddenly came in like this and told me that. what should I do?

841
01:19:18.475 --> 01:19:21.283
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. Jumi. Jumi.

842
01:19:21.683 --> 01:19:24.783
- Bon appétit! - Itadakimasu!

843
01:19:28.766 --> 01:19:29.699
What is it?

844
01:19:31.682 --> 01:19:34.032
Were you happy sucking on other people's tears?

845
01:19:34.033 --> 01:19:35.431
It was an old hag?

846
01:19:35.432 --> 01:19:37.866
But what bastard sent this wrinkled old woman!

847
01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.075
Who is it?

848
01:19:45.808 --> 01:19:48.033
Oh Gwang-ryeol? Jeon In-deuk?

849
01:19:48.975 --> 01:19:50.117
Surely not Madam Hong?

850
01:19:55.807 --> 01:19:58.241
What does it matter who you die by?

851
01:20:03.475 --> 01:20:05.367
Why you die is important.

852
01:20:06.641 --> 01:20:07.658
CEO!

853
01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:09.325
CEO!

854
01:20:10.058 --> 01:20:10.991
CEO!

855
01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:16.325
Hey! Go prepare that old woman's funeral!

856
01:20:18.099 --> 01:20:19.158
Wow!

857
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:20.950
Godmother Jo-gak.

858
01:20:23.391 --> 01:20:25.074
This can't be done. no matter what.

859
01:20:25.075 --> 01:20:28.324
Even if it's Godmother. this is too dangerous. really.

860
01:20:28.325 --> 01:20:30.408
You'll die if you go. really.

861
01:20:33.808 --> 01:20:35.366
Do as you please. damn it.

862
01:20:44.933 --> 01:20:46.741
Hey! Catch that bitch!

863
01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:57.075
Catch her. catch her!

864
01:20:59.225 --> 01:21:00.575
Hey. find her quickly!

865
01:21:02.266 --> 01:21:03.681
Ah. what is it?

866
01:21:03.682 --> 01:21:04.783
Hey. come quickly!

867
01:21:23.433 --> 01:21:24.641
Tuu?

868
01:21:24.642 --> 01:21:25.575
Why him?

869
01:21:25.891 --> 01:21:26.991
Where is he now?

870
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:31.533
No. are you crazy to push the next ace into mortal danger?

871
01:21:32.141 --> 01:21:35.824
And Godmother. there's a quota for compassion for everyone.

872
01:21:35.825 --> 01:21:39.325
Veterinarian Kang Bong-hoe. you kept him alive because of a private connection. didn't you?

873
01:21:39.808 --> 01:21:41.700
That's why you gave up on the disinfection too.

874
01:21:42.433 --> 01:21:43.241
Tsk.

875
01:21:43.808 --> 01:21:46.408
You've lived too long. Godmother.

876
01:21:58.266 --> 01:21:59.158
Hey!

877
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:42.783
I got him! He's in front of Room 4!

878
01:22:46.475 --> 01:22:49.783
Damn it. if you're old. just die. Why are you trying so hard to live?

879
01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:54.783
Excuse me. Chief Son.

880
01:22:55.391 --> 01:22:59.514
This is different. How much money have we poured into this?

881
01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:01.740
How could you let the business go to waste. damn it!

882
01:23:01.741 --> 01:23:04.116
He should have died several times already.

883
01:23:04.433 --> 01:23:07.450
Why are you complaining so much when good fortune has come your way. huh?

884
01:23:08.058 --> 01:23:11.033
Let's meet and settle this... Ah. damn it.

885
01:23:21.058 --> 01:23:23.658
What are you going to do. apologize?

886
01:23:28.349 --> 01:23:30.075
I'm tired. let's just finish this.

887
01:23:31.141 --> 01:23:32.408
You bug.

888
01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:34.991
Eat some on your way.

889
01:23:37.933 --> 01:23:40.824
Kids. get some nutrition!

890
01:23:40.825 --> 01:23:43.075
- Wow. - Good.

891
01:24:04.033 --> 01:24:06.158
Hey. do it thoroughly.

892
01:24:11.808 --> 01:24:12.949
Eat a lot.

893
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:14.408
Oh. grandma.

894
01:24:37.475 --> 01:24:38.740
Let's finish quickly and go.

895
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.140
Hey. hey. stop.

896
01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:42.157
Hey. stop! Hey. block him!

897
01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:43.908
Hey! I said stop. you jerk!

898
01:24:53.975 --> 01:24:54.992
It's not over yet. is it?

899
01:24:55.766 --> 01:24:57.658
What. is it your son?

900
01:24:58.391 --> 01:24:59.390
Yes.

901
01:25:00.641 --> 01:25:01.741
He is family.

902
01:25:25.531 --> 01:25:26.516
Damn it!

903
01:25:34.808 --> 01:25:36.241
Where is he. damn it!

904
01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.033
Where is he!

905
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.116
Are you okay? Huh?

906
01:25:57.516 --> 01:25:58.741
Ugh. go die!

907
01:26:11.308 --> 01:26:12.283
Are you worried?

908
01:26:13.725 --> 01:26:14.617
Yes.

909
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:18.599
Then attach Tuu as a lighthouse. you yourself.

910
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.159
Chief Son has no intentions.

911
01:26:22.641 --> 01:26:25.740
Will Tuu go just because I attach him?

912
01:26:25.741 --> 01:26:27.366
Just do as I tell you.

913
01:26:53.183 --> 01:26:54.241
Have a meal before you go.

914
01:26:55.059 --> 01:26:56.598
How can you cook in that state?

915
01:26:56.599 --> 01:26:58.950
I can cook a meal for a colleague.

916
01:27:14.016 --> 01:27:14.949
Normal people.

917
01:27:16.142 --> 01:27:17.200
What?

918
01:27:17.934 --> 01:27:19.283
Normal people.

919
01:27:21.475 --> 01:27:23.200
they'd eat like this often. wouldn't they?

920
01:27:25.266 --> 01:27:26.824
But how did you become an exterminator?

921
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:29.408
Usefulness.

922
01:27:30.183 --> 01:27:32.616
- Huh? - When I was little.

923
01:27:33.016 --> 01:27:34.658
I was so hungry.

924
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.783
I stole and ate some bellflower roots from next door.

925
01:27:39.016 --> 01:27:40.575
But they were wild ginseng.

926
01:27:41.641 --> 01:27:44.700
My family was ruined paying for them.

927
01:27:44.701 --> 01:27:46.074
and I was kicked out that way.

928
01:27:46.075 --> 01:27:48.408
I wandered from maid to maid.

929
01:27:49.016 --> 01:27:50.866
often beaten.

930
01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:53.866
abandoned. and running away again.

931
01:27:54.266 --> 01:27:55.700
Everyone told me to go die.

932
01:27:56.891 --> 01:27:59.741
That I was a useless woman in this world.

933
01:28:02.975 --> 01:28:05.658
Then. when I was sixteen.

934
01:28:06.391 --> 01:28:09.307
I met someone who accepted me as family.

935
01:28:09.308 --> 01:28:10.825
What's your name?

936
01:28:11.141 --> 01:28:12.574
Min Seol-hwa.

937
01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:14.557
A pretty name.

938
01:28:14.558 --> 01:28:17.325
She fed me. gave me a place to sleep.

939
01:28:17.651 --> 01:28:19.031
and gave me work.

940
01:28:19.308 --> 01:28:20.783
And from that person.

941
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.492
I heard the word 'useful' for the first time.

942
01:28:29.433 --> 01:28:31.224
Don't dodge like that.

943
01:28:31.225 --> 01:28:32.700
If you use your reflexes just any time.

944
01:28:32.701 --> 01:28:34.992
you're showing off that you're an exterminator.

945
01:28:35.392 --> 01:28:37.533
Hide it even if your head breaks. understood?

946
01:28:38.058 --> 01:28:39.116
Yes.

947
01:28:39.391 --> 01:28:40.783
Let's stop here for today.

948
01:28:43.266 --> 01:28:46.116
I think this work is sacred.

949
01:28:46.683 --> 01:28:50.408
Each and every one of us is saving this world.

950
01:28:51.183 --> 01:28:52.325
Even if no one knows.

951
01:28:58.058 --> 01:29:00.575
I'm envious. I also had someone like that.

952
01:29:01.558 --> 01:29:03.283
like family.

953
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:04.890
Just for a moment.

954
01:29:05.933 --> 01:29:06.950
How is it?

955
01:29:08.224 --> 01:29:10.075
Do you remember? When we first met?

956
01:29:11.725 --> 01:29:13.700
Was that 25 years ago?

957
01:29:16.558 --> 01:29:17.558
Hello?

958
01:29:33.183 --> 01:29:34.991
I'm sorry. Do-young.

959
01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:52.783
Wow. this is touching. isn't it?

960
01:29:54.266 --> 01:29:55.225
Of course.

961
01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.658
You must have known why I came looking for you. right?

962
01:30:02.725 --> 01:30:05.033
It's not enough to kill him myself.

963
01:30:05.682 --> 01:30:09.199
so why would I hand over a long-standing revenge to someone else in such a trivial way?

964
01:30:09.682 --> 01:30:11.366
I have to play with him until the very end.

965
01:30:23.408 --> 01:30:25.908
If you just accept everything they give you.

966
01:30:26.433 --> 01:30:27.491
you'll end up dead.

967
01:30:28.433 --> 01:30:30.325
Especially when you open your heart to someone you call a colleague.

968
01:30:37.016 --> 01:30:38.075
On purpose?

969
01:30:40.141 --> 01:30:42.348
Did you fail on purpose?

970
01:30:42.349 --> 01:30:44.324
Knowing I would come?

971
01:30:44.325 --> 01:30:45.241
Fifty-fifty.

972
01:30:46.433 --> 01:30:48.974
But you're definitely the type to find me.

973
01:30:48.975 --> 01:30:50.158
No wonder.

974
01:30:50.766 --> 01:30:51.908
It was too...

975
01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.450
messy.

976
01:31:14.991 --> 01:31:17.408
Think of it as being scratched by an animal's claw.

977
01:31:17.975 --> 01:31:19.326
See you in hell.

978
01:31:53.891 --> 01:31:56.866
I sent the one you cherish to his grave.

979
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:04.533
I shouldn't have let you in.

980
01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:08.992
When did you ever let me in?

981
01:32:10.433 --> 01:32:12.075
I did all this for us.

982
01:32:15.808 --> 01:32:17.615
for Shinseong Disinfection.

983
01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:20.366
It was all for us!

984
01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:23.367
Yes. you worked hard.

985
01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:27.367
If it were your father.

986
01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:32.074
what choice would he make?

987
01:32:40.433 --> 01:32:41.408
You'll do it. right?

988
01:32:42.516 --> 01:32:43.950
All the unfinished business.

989
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.116
burn it all here.

990
01:32:47.724 --> 01:32:49.033
And you leave too.

991
01:32:57.891 --> 01:32:59.658
- Oh. good job. - Hae-ni.

992
01:33:00.266 --> 01:33:01.366
Dad.

993
01:33:03.808 --> 01:33:06.783
Ah. whose daughter is that? Huh? Oh dear!

994
01:33:09.391 --> 01:33:11.325
- High five. - Good job. high five.

995
01:33:12.266 --> 01:33:13.408
High five!

996
01:33:14.516 --> 01:33:16.283
- Did you see me? - You did so well.

997
01:33:17.016 --> 01:33:19.574
- Oh dear. no. where did she go? - Mother. I'll see you next time.

998
01:33:19.575 --> 01:33:20.949
- You did so well. - Teacher.

999
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:22.241
Ah. yes. Hae-ni's father. hello.

1000
01:33:22.242 --> 01:33:23.699
- Hello. Grandma. - Um. Hae-ni...

1001
01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:27.515
Oh. Hae-ni? She left first just a moment ago.

1002
01:33:27.516 --> 01:33:30.431
- Then I'll look for the restroom. - Yes.

1003
01:33:30.432 --> 01:33:32.282
Then I'll look further inside.

1004
01:33:32.283 --> 01:33:35.491
Hae-ni! Hae-ni!

1005
01:33:50.058 --> 01:33:51.158
Go.

1006
01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:00.241
Gotcha.

1007
01:34:03.933 --> 01:34:06.450
I'm sorry. you grabbed me so suddenly.

1008
01:34:06.891 --> 01:34:09.741
Isn't this wrong? Why even a child?

1009
01:34:11.016 --> 01:34:11.949
What?

1010
01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:17.366
Are you going to pretend you don't see this?

1011
01:34:19.866 --> 01:34:23.783
I thought about it at the gates of hell. and Hae-ni seemed so pitiful.

1012
01:34:26.283 --> 01:34:28.491
It's obvious she'll be left alone like us.

1013
01:34:29.141 --> 01:34:31.158
I know that feeling well from experience.

1014
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:34.224
This goes against my principles.

1015
01:34:34.225 --> 01:34:36.367
but I feel so bad that I can't help it.

1016
01:34:37.183 --> 01:34:38.533
This is the problem with humans.

1017
01:34:38.933 --> 01:34:42.033
When they're down. principles and everything else lose meaning.

1018
01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:43.825
You understand. right?

1019
01:34:44.308 --> 01:34:45.908
I'll prepare a big party.

1020
01:34:46.266 --> 01:34:47.824
Then only grandma comes.

1021
01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:49.390
Happy Land.

1022
01:34:49.391 --> 01:34:52.283
Who are you. really? What do you want?

1023
01:34:53.016 --> 01:34:54.616
You absolutely cannot report it.

1024
01:34:55.391 --> 01:34:56.574
I'll bring her back.

1025
01:34:56.575 --> 01:34:57.949
What nonsense are you talking about?

1026
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:59.158
Report it immediately.

1027
01:35:03.599 --> 01:35:04.533
Trust me.

1028
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.908
Hae-ni will be safe.

1029
01:35:08.558 --> 01:35:10.116
He's after me.

1030
01:35:21.766 --> 01:35:24.658
Hae-ni. please... huh?

1031
01:35:35.474 --> 01:35:37.533
Is it because I saved him that day?

1032
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.700
I saved someone I shouldn't have.

1033
01:35:42.641 --> 01:35:43.866
Is that it?

1034
01:35:47.516 --> 01:35:50.574
Even so. I don't regret it. Treating you.

1035
01:35:52.682 --> 01:35:54.324
Because it was the right thing to do.

1036
01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:40.616
Why aren't you going?

1037
01:36:42.141 --> 01:36:43.658
Goodbye.

1038
01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.992
Mu-yong. do you remember what I said?

1039
01:37:36.557 --> 01:37:37.616
Mu-yong!

1040
01:38:47.975 --> 01:38:49.200
Ugh. damn it...

1041
01:38:55.224 --> 01:38:56.825
Check. blind spot rooftop.

1042
01:38:57.225 --> 01:38:58.325
All clear.

1043
01:39:11.475 --> 01:39:12.700
Third floor. third floor!

1044
01:39:23.016 --> 01:39:24.199
Keep your distance. keep your distance.

1045
01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.075
It's open!

1046
01:39:32.475 --> 01:39:34.223
Team B entering third floor.

1047
01:39:34.224 --> 01:39:35.325
Cover the third floor.

1048
01:39:45.058 --> 01:39:45.950
Fifth floor!

1049
01:39:46.975 --> 01:39:48.200
Go to the stairs next to you!

1050
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:56.699
Help me!

1051
01:39:58.433 --> 01:40:00.200
Help me!

1052
01:40:23.974 --> 01:40:25.033
Why can't I see him?

1053
01:40:29.016 --> 01:40:30.284
Entering from both sides!

1054
01:40:30.974 --> 01:40:31.858
Come out!

1055
01:42:08.933 --> 01:42:10.366
You don't touch kids.

1056
01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:12.282
That's your only rule. right?

1057
01:42:12.283 --> 01:42:13.408
Don't kick!

1058
01:42:15.808 --> 01:42:16.741
Alright then.

1059
01:42:26.516 --> 01:42:27.533
Drop your gun.

1060
01:42:36.575 --> 01:42:38.033
Why is it taking so long?

1061
01:42:38.766 --> 01:42:40.408
I thought I'd die waiting.

1062
01:42:40.807 --> 01:42:44.158
So. what you've prepared is this kind of farce?

1063
01:42:46.891 --> 01:42:49.908
I was worried that the old revenge would end trivially. weren't you?

1064
01:42:50.766 --> 01:42:51.908
Well. I guess.

1065
01:42:52.808 --> 01:42:55.974
The so-called colleagues are just too incompetent.

1066
01:42:55.975 --> 01:42:57.699
This bastard. I've been patient enough. you son of a...

1067
01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.909
- You young punk. have you no respect? - Lieutenant Lee.

1068
01:42:59.910 --> 01:43:01.990
I've pulled all the advance payment. Is there a problem?

1069
01:43:01.991 --> 01:43:04.782
Because of your idiotic actions. all our men died.

1070
01:43:04.783 --> 01:43:06.866
Didn't you know they were bullet shields from the start?

1071
01:43:07.641 --> 01:43:08.658
Say that again.

1072
01:43:15.225 --> 01:43:18.325
Hey. you crazy bitch. do you still think you're the godmother?

1073
01:43:22.308 --> 01:43:23.283
Get up!

1074
01:43:24.266 --> 01:43:25.325
Hey. get up!

1075
01:43:26.016 --> 01:43:26.891
Get up!

1076
01:43:35.016 --> 01:43:36.699
You. damn it!

1077
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:42.408
See? I told you she's not an easy opponent.

1078
01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:45.598
I'll go up and give you a generous final payment.

1079
01:43:45.599 --> 01:43:46.617
Go safely.

1080
01:43:46.933 --> 01:43:49.158
Ugh. you bastards.

1081
01:43:58.766 --> 01:44:00.283
Why are you acting so disappointingly?

1082
01:44:11.850 --> 01:44:13.158
I'll cut off your ears.

1083
01:44:22.683 --> 01:44:23.866
The rest too!

1084
01:44:35.099 --> 01:44:37.265
What do I have to do to make you send the child back?

1085
01:44:37.266 --> 01:44:39.949
Send back what? Just take her yourself.

1086
01:44:40.725 --> 01:44:43.867
Why do you keep dragging Mr. Kang into this. between you and me?

1087
01:44:45.516 --> 01:44:48.283
That veterinarian is someone to be protected.

1088
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:52.241
And I'm trash that needs to be cleaned up?

1089
01:44:55.016 --> 01:44:56.116
Seems so.

1090
01:45:05.558 --> 01:45:06.741
Why are you doing this to me?

1091
01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:09.616
And you. you're the one who is

1092
01:45:10.558 --> 01:45:12.325
discarded waste. aren't you?

1093
01:45:13.391 --> 01:45:15.199
Because you're old and useless.

1094
01:45:19.266 --> 01:45:22.533
Someone said that when someone gets old and useless.

1095
01:45:23.266 --> 01:45:25.158
they shouldn't be thrown away.

1096
01:45:29.891 --> 01:45:32.200
You can never protect Mr. Kang.

1097
01:45:32.850 --> 01:45:34.431
Because I'm going to kill him.

1098
01:45:34.432 --> 01:45:35.949
All his family too.

1099
01:45:41.766 --> 01:45:43.283
How are you going to protect anything like that?

1100
01:45:51.641 --> 01:45:52.908
Grandma. ah!

1101
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.700
If you keep this up.

1102
01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:00.283
I'll throw her first.

1103
01:46:02.516 --> 01:46:04.574
- No! - You bastards. you're all dead!

1104
01:46:04.575 --> 01:46:06.325
Ugh. damn it.

1105
01:46:13.808 --> 01:46:15.075
What to do?

1106
01:46:15.475 --> 01:46:17.450
The winner gets to ride in grandma's car. huh?

1107
01:46:19.891 --> 01:46:21.117
You learned wrong.

1108
01:46:23.058 --> 01:46:25.158
If you treat others like bugs.

1109
01:46:25.159 --> 01:46:27.908
you become as insignificant as a bug yourself.

1110
01:46:31.683 --> 01:46:34.575
Sorry. I'm self-taught.

1111
01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:38.533
Can I kill her?

1112
01:46:40.558 --> 01:46:43.158
Oh. weren't you planning not to?

1113
01:47:03.891 --> 01:47:04.867
Look where.

1114
01:47:15.850 --> 01:47:17.408
What. is it over?

1115
01:47:23.975 --> 01:47:25.075
You don't like it?

1116
01:47:31.225 --> 01:47:33.307
When does your dad come home?

1117
01:47:33.308 --> 01:47:35.950
He comes after 12.

1118
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:37.950
And there are many days he doesn't come home.

1119
01:47:40.725 --> 01:47:42.658
You should go to sleep now. okay?

1120
01:47:44.058 --> 01:47:47.306
By the way. what music are you listening to?

1121
01:47:47.307 --> 01:47:49.074
Oh. this?

1122
01:47:50.725 --> 01:47:52.075
Listen to this when you're having a hard time.

1123
01:47:58.808 --> 01:47:59.908
This...

1124
01:48:00.766 --> 01:48:01.950
This isn't right.

1125
01:48:07.683 --> 01:48:09.033
Are you giving this to me?

1126
01:48:21.725 --> 01:48:23.700
Isn't two a bit unfair?

1127
01:48:24.141 --> 01:48:25.116
Should I throw one away?

1128
01:48:25.682 --> 01:48:28.116
As you please. but you'll regret it.

1129
01:48:43.825 --> 01:48:45.492
I definitely returned it.

1130
01:48:48.725 --> 01:48:49.824
Thanks for that.

1131
01:49:00.891 --> 01:49:01.865
Bae Do-young.

1132
01:49:01.866 --> 01:49:04.531
When your father comes home with money.

1133
01:49:04.532 --> 01:49:06.116
didn't I tell you to come out immediately and

1134
01:49:06.117 --> 01:49:09.198
greet him. huh. you bastard!

1135
01:49:09.199 --> 01:49:12.346
Who do you take after to be so weak?

1136
01:49:12.347 --> 01:49:14.158
You idiot!

1137
01:49:14.765 --> 01:49:15.658
Boss!

1138
01:49:17.683 --> 01:49:18.991
What is it. damn it!

1139
01:49:42.724 --> 01:49:44.950
You're a legend. is this all you can do?

1140
01:49:55.225 --> 01:49:56.240
This is emergency report 112.

1141
01:49:56.241 --> 01:49:59.782
I've been kidnapped. Please call my dad.

1142
01:49:59.783 --> 01:50:03.741
Kang Hae-ni. Please track my location quickly and rescue me... Ah!

1143
01:50:25.266 --> 01:50:26.408
Always remember this.

1144
01:50:26.806 --> 01:50:28.700
This is the seed sown by the old woman. I'm not like others. I keep my promises.

1145
01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:33.574
I'm not like others. I keep my promises.

1146
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.075
Promise?

1147
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:38.450
Have a good trip.

1148
01:50:54.574 --> 01:50:56.908
Still don't know? How foolish.

1149
01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:07.616
Are you stalling for time?

1150
01:51:09.641 --> 01:51:10.741
Because of her?

1151
01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.158
Please.

1152
01:51:22.058 --> 01:51:23.366
Look at me.

1153
01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.117
Me!

1154
01:52:21.266 --> 01:52:22.950
Don't be too upset.

1155
01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.242
I think I'll be joining you soon.

1156
01:52:26.058 --> 01:52:27.200
Finally.

1157
01:52:29.058 --> 01:52:29.991
you've arrived.

1158
01:52:42.683 --> 01:52:44.908
This time. I won.

1159
01:52:46.016 --> 01:52:46.950
Because I'm

1160
01:52:48.183 --> 01:52:49.158
leaving

1161
01:52:50.933 --> 01:52:52.783
before you.

1162
01:53:08.433 --> 01:53:09.741
- Have a good trip. - Yes.

1163
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:14.241
Make sure to take your lunch medicine.

1164
01:53:17.142 --> 01:53:18.742
Why were you nice to me?

1165
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.075
Even though you wouldn't

1166
01:53:25.933 --> 01:53:27.408
recognize me.

1167
01:53:32.558 --> 01:53:33.740
Do-young. where are you going?

1168
01:53:33.741 --> 01:53:34.783
To get my indoor shoes.

1169
01:53:46.725 --> 01:53:48.241
You didn't see anything.

1170
01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:50.075
Forget it.

1171
01:53:51.308 --> 01:53:52.950
Can't I come with you?

1172
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:56.742
Next time. when you're a little older.

1173
01:54:07.182 --> 01:54:08.116
I'll

1174
01:54:08.475 --> 01:54:09.783
come find you.

1175
01:54:14.808 --> 01:54:15.741
Promise.

1176
01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.742
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1177
01:54:36.975 --> 01:54:38.616
Because I was scared.

1178
01:54:40.391 --> 01:54:41.658
What if you don't

1179
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:45.617
remember?

1180
01:55:04.849 --> 01:55:06.575
Do you remember everything now?

1181
01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.034
Yes.

1182
01:55:14.391 --> 01:55:15.408
How?

1183
01:55:15.724 --> 01:55:17.533
When a person is about to die.

1184
01:55:18.266 --> 01:55:21.533
their life flashes before their eyes.

1185
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:24.450
Promise me.

1186
01:55:25.141 --> 01:55:27.616
The day will surely come when you'll be stronger than your dad.

1187
01:55:29.308 --> 01:55:31.533
Until then. live with a knife in your heart.

1188
01:55:33.308 --> 01:55:34.575
Sleep well tonight.

1189
01:55:36.349 --> 01:55:37.991
Tomorrow will be better.

1190
01:55:40.183 --> 01:55:41.116
Together?

1191
01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.075
What?

1192
01:55:43.517 --> 01:55:44.991
Can't we go to Happyland?

1193
01:55:45.432 --> 01:55:46.491
Happyland?

1194
01:55:47.850 --> 01:55:48.992
The amusement park.

1195
01:55:50.016 --> 01:55:52.783
All my friends bragged about going.

1196
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:54.450
No?

1197
01:56:05.766 --> 01:56:06.742
Shall we?

1198
01:56:09.308 --> 01:56:10.575
Liar.

1199
01:56:11.975 --> 01:56:13.742
You didn't answer.

1200
01:56:17.475 --> 01:56:18.741
It seems

1201
01:56:19.475 --> 01:56:20.491
your time

1202
01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:23.658
to go

1203
01:56:25.891 --> 01:56:27.408
hasn't come yet.

1204
01:56:33.516 --> 01:56:34.700
Now.

1205
01:56:35.891 --> 01:56:37.825
do you know how to swallow pills?

1206
01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:12.242
This is our new family member.

1207
01:57:36.933 --> 01:57:38.016
Ryu.

1208
01:57:39.016 --> 01:57:42.533
It's not because you created something to protect.

1209
01:57:47.308 --> 01:57:48.616
In the end. we are all just

1210
01:57:48.975 --> 01:57:51.783
beings that break and disappear. aren't we?

1211
01:57:52.975 --> 01:57:55.492
Dad. why did you come home so early today?

1212
01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.450
But living with that loss

1213
01:58:01.183 --> 01:58:02.700
doesn't seem so bad.

1214
01:58:06.391 --> 01:58:08.408
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

1215
01:58:09.891 --> 01:58:11.074
- Amen! - Amen!

1216
01:58:11.075 --> 01:58:13.824
Even though I was in prison.

1217
01:58:13.825 --> 01:58:16.157
the people who sued me.

1218
01:58:16.158 --> 01:58:18.449
the two-faced bastards.

1219
01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:19.992
whoever they were.

1220
01:58:19.993 --> 01:58:23.199
not once did I resent them.

1221
01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:24.366
- Amen! - Amen!

1222
01:58:25.491 --> 01:58:27.240
Hey. husband. today

1223
01:58:27.241 --> 01:58:29.617
you need to keep our Mihyang warm.

1224
01:58:30.391 --> 01:58:31.908
And not yet. Ryu.

1225
01:58:32.308 --> 01:58:36.158
it seems your time to go hasn't come yet.

1226
01:58:42.308 --> 01:58:44.158
There's a lot to do.
