Still can't
afford to buy a boat.

3
00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:05.648
You know what they used
to call me in the army. right?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.445
- Mr. Fish and Loaves.
- That's right! That's right!

5
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.672
No matter what the resources.
I would make it work.

6
00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:13.155
- Dad!
- Oh!

7
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.390
Welcome
to your worst nightmare.

8
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.406
It's Mom. I think this
place is starting to get to her.

9
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.737
You've been going out there
for weeks now.

10
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.063
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

11
00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:23.708
Help your Mom get everybody
secured. tucked away.

12
00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:26.414
And when I get home tonight. we
will talk.

13
00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:27.745
I promise.

15
00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:40.188
The only way
for us to go home

16
00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.165
is to wake everyone up.

17
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.656
Abby. stop!

18
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:45.000
I found something. s-something
I think is gonna help us.

19
00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:46.085
Mom!

20
00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:48.485
No. no!

21
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.818
They're in the house!

22
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:54.867
We have to go.

23
00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:57.410
Go where?
Where are we going?

24
00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.082
You go first.

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.734
I'll follow you down.

26
00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.507
We need to get to town.

27
00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:05.601
No. We have to go to the trees.

28
00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:07.156
You have to get inside.

29
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.531
The tree? No!

30
00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:09.540
You'll be safe!

31
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:10.781
- What?
- I promise.

32
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.109
- Go. go!
- No. wait!

33
00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:14.822
Find your brother.
I'll be right behind...

34
00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:18.538
You went through
a Farway tree!

35
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.351
- Honey...
- What is going on?

36
00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:21.648
What's happening?

37
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.023
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

38
00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:26.945
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

39
00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:28.459
Is anybody out there?

40
00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.320
All I got was some static.
but it worked.

41
00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.063
I think if we get it up
over the tree line.

42
00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:35.196
and we get it enough power.

43
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.692
I think we could
get a signal out.

44
00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:38.657
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

45
00:01:38.907 --> 00:01:40.792
We start by going
to the high ground.

46
00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:42.429
If these voices
are real.

47
00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:44.300
if something here is
communicating with you.

48
00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:45.964
then that means you're
connected to this place

49
00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:47.523
in a way that
no one else here is.

50
00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:48.999
But we need proof.

51
00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:50.257
What is this?

52
00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.524
They said they
watched you bury the bag

53
00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.462
and that this is proof
that they're real.

54
00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:57.927
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

55
00:01:58.012 --> 00:01:58.984
Tell me you're joking.

56
00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.218
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

57
00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:04.578
That girl may be
the way we all go home.

58
00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:06.117
Let's take a walk.

59
00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:09.109
Where are we going?

60
00:02:09.302 --> 00:02:11.054
Find our way home.

61
00:02:31.182 --> 00:02:33.390
How do you know this
is the right way to go?

62
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.992
I don't.

63
00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:36.648
I'm just following
my best hunch.

64
00:02:38.884 --> 00:02:40.406
Based on what?

65
00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.101
Based on that.

66
00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:03.898
What is that?

67
00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:06.426
I don't know.

68
00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.734
No idea.

69
00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:11.851
But it's. uh...
It's where I found these.

70
00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:13.773
Okay.

71
00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:16.726
We're gonna camp out
here for the night.

72
00:03:16.898 --> 00:03:18.257
But it's not dark yet.

73
00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:21.322
Hey. look. this right here
is as far as I've ever gotten.

74
00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.211
Once we go beyond this point.

75
00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:25.210
we're in completely
uncharted territory.

76
00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:27.875
and I'm not about to do
that two hours before dark.

77
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.614
We camp here. Go inside.

78
00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:32.757
Will you at least
take these off?

79
00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.013
No.

80
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.063
I have to go to the bathroom.

81
00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:38.882
Well. that's why
I cuffed you in front.

82
00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:40.437
Don't go far.

83
00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:51.447
<i>Speaks Cantonese...</i>

84
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.681
Hey. you.

85
00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:38.715
Hey.

86
00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:41.343
I. uh. finished Chapter 6.

87
00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:42.953
- Ah.
- You're up.

88
00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:44.318
What do you think so far?

89
00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:45.914
Well. it's not exactly
my favorite.

90
00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.262
but I'm interested to see
how things turn out.

91
00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:50.453
You think there's
gonna be a happy ending?

92
00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.929
I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.

93
00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.434
Get home safe. Sheriff.

94
00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.189
You. too.

95
00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:06.319
Great work today. everybody.

96
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:08.703
Come on in.

97
00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:11.984
Hey. you okay?

98
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.047
Looking a little long
in the face.

99
00:05:14.132 --> 00:05:16.951
Oh. uh. that's genetic.

100
00:05:17.035 --> 00:05:19.756
Get a good sleep tonight.
The real work starts tomorrow.

101
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.642
Yes. ma'am.

102
00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:28.351
So. livin' in a jail cell now.
that's quaint.

103
00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:30.305
It's temporary.

104
00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.001
Right. Until we get
this miraculous tower set up

105
00:05:34.085 --> 00:05:36.476
and send our radio signal
out to Never land.

106
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.479
Hey.
Cut the shit. all right?

107
00:05:39.563 --> 00:05:42.062
Some of the folks in there need
something to feel good about.

108
00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.226
Great. Let's play
make-believe. I'm game.

109
00:05:56.844 --> 00:06:00.000
Tabby. are you hungry?
I made some dinner.

110
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.696
I'll be right up.

111
00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:43.317
Ethan. I told you
to pick up the toys!

112
00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:57.421
Can somebody grab that. please?

113
00:07:02.734 --> 00:07:03.761
Jim?

114
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.934
Grab the kids.
There's something's wrong.

115
00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:16.396
Jim. answer me!

116
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:19.404
Jim?

117

He kept saying
he was fine.

He was making jokes
about the tower.

147
00:10:25.727 --> 00:10:28.242
He...

148
00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:50.852
- Oh. that's backwards.
- Flip it.

149
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:53.438
Yeah.
Just make sure it's flush.

150
00:10:53.523 --> 00:10:55.023
That's it.

151
00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:56.757
Hey. Kenny.

152
00:10:56.998 --> 00:10:59.570
Hey. Jade's all set up
in the kitchen. uh.

153
00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:00.810
with the batteries. and. uh.

154
00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:02.883
I think we've got enough wire
and cords now for the cable.

155
00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:05.335
All right. well.
we're gonna need more material

156
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.304
if we wanna get this
tower up high enough.

157
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:10.323
Right. I'll send
people down to the barn.

158
00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:11.844
I think there should
be plenty of wood there

159
00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:13.460
for them to scavenge.

160
00:11:13.937 --> 00:11:15.014
- All right.
- Cool.

161
00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:17.187
Hey. how you doing?

162
00:11:17.272 --> 00:11:19.390
Had a rough morning.

163
00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:22.726
Is. uh...
Is Eric with you?

164
00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.025
I need him to go
on a supply run.

165
00:11:28.738 --> 00:11:30.606
Eric's not coming.

166
00:11:35.763 --> 00:11:37.235
Hey.

167
00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:42.913
Mind if I join you?

168
00:11:43.212 --> 00:11:44.783
I would not mind at all.

169
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:50.847
Hey.

170
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:57.945
You hear about Eric?

171
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.469
Yeah.

172
00:12:00.909 --> 00:12:02.648
Yeah.

173
00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:05.252
I-I didn't
see that one coming.

174
00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:14.398
It's weird. you know. this
radio might actually work.

175
00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:18.303
and as amazing as that is...

176
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:20.596
I think part of me...

177
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.936
I think the idea
that it might work

178
00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:31.085
is scarier than
the idea that it won't.

179
00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:32.976
What do you mean?

180
00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:36.398
I keep thinking...

181
00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:41.474
"How do we go back now?"

182
00:12:44.677 --> 00:12:47.390
After everything we've seen.
some of the things we've done.

183
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.738
how do we just...

184
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.786
And even if we can
go back. how do...

185
00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:58.429
I'm not sure we can
ever really go home.

186
00:13:00.495 --> 00:13:02.363
We're not the same
people anymore.

187
00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:11.601
You know. when my dad...

188
00:13:11.962 --> 00:13:15.211
came back home
from Afghanistan.

189
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.421
he said that that
coming home from war is like...

190
00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:23.991
it's like traveling
from another planet.

191
00:13:24.076 --> 00:13:25.598
And then
when you come back.

192
00:13:25.683 --> 00:13:29.485
you can't tell if
everything is different

193
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.283
than it was when
you left it or... or...

194
00:13:33.591 --> 00:13:35.155
...or if it's you.

195
00:13:37.058 --> 00:13:38.860
if you're the one
that's changed.

196
00:13:40.857 --> 00:13:42.857
What's it gonna be like for us?

197
00:13:46.068 --> 00:13:48.574
This is the only place
we've ever known together.

198
00:13:56.234 --> 00:13:58.655
I'll be right back.

199
00:13:58.982 --> 00:14:00.553
Where you going?

200
00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:04.191
Go find a sharper knife.

201
00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:06.317
This one's
just taking forever.

202
00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:14.954
Hey.
Hold up a sec.

203
00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:20.570
What are you doing?

204
00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:24.804
Making sure we
find our way back.

205
00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.718
All right. let's go.

206
00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:44.844
How do you know
it's not just like the road?

207
00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:46.682
What's that?

208
00:14:46.881 --> 00:14:48.719
It just goes
in one big loop

209
00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:51.621
and then brings
you back to town.

210
00:14:52.898 --> 00:14:54.772
How do you know this
isn't the same?

211
00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:59.024
How do you know we
won't just walk and...

212
00:14:59.108 --> 00:15:00.702
walk and walk.

213
00:15:00.787 --> 00:15:04.320
and then end up right back
in town where we started?

214
00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:06.702
I don't.

215
00:15:07.028 --> 00:15:08.804
Guess we'll see.

216
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.401
Let me ask you a question.

217
00:15:14.124 --> 00:15:15.744
You say those voices told you

218
00:15:15.828 --> 00:15:18.671
that killing those people
would get everyone home.

219
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.783
You ever stop to think
that maybe they were lying?

220
00:15:21.868 --> 00:15:25.109
I don't want to talk about that.
- Wait. wait. wait.

221
00:15:26.482 --> 00:15:28.741
I think. if we're gonna start
second-guessing

222
00:15:28.841 --> 00:15:31.793
each other's decisions.
then that seems like

223
00:15:31.877 --> 00:15:33.405
a fair question to ask.

224
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.118
So. what is it?
What exactly

225
00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:39.569
did they tell you that made you
willing to kill that little boy?

226
00:15:40.512 --> 00:15:42.001
You wouldn't understand.

227
00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:44.267
Try me.

228
00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:47.270
They told me...

229
00:15:47.354 --> 00:15:49.778
that those people were coming.

230
00:15:49.862 --> 00:15:52.440
They told me that there
would be two cars!

231
00:15:52.524 --> 00:15:55.866
And they said that if
I didn't do what they said...

232
00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:58.589
Then what?

233
00:15:58.673 --> 00:16:00.492
If you didn't do
what they said. then what?

234
00:16:00.576 --> 00:16:05.123
Hey. let me explain to you
again how this works.

235
00:16:05.207 --> 00:16:07.356
I say jump. you jump.

236
00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:09.993
I ask you a question.
then you goddamn answer...

237
00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:13.486
They said my brother
would die. okay?!

238
00:16:14.513 --> 00:16:18.070
They said that
if I didn't do it.

239
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.129
that he would die.
that everyone would die!

240
00:16:30.804 --> 00:16:33.217
Why didn't you
just put me in the box?

241
00:16:33.301 --> 00:16:36.104
I don't know!
I thought...

242
00:16:40.143 --> 00:16:41.582
Hey.

243
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:57.290
I've seen this town
make good people...

244
00:17:01.494 --> 00:17:02.933
do bad things.

245
00:17:08.468 --> 00:17:10.105
Let's keep moving.

246
00:17:26.016 --> 00:17:27.802
I don't understand.

247
00:17:27.887 --> 00:17:29.583
Ethan said
he thinks it's a puzzle.

248
00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:31.490
No. not a puzzle.

249
00:17:31.575 --> 00:17:32.997
A story.

250
00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:35.521
They all fit together
and tell a story.

251
00:17:35.606 --> 00:17:37.589
And once we
figure out the story.

252
00:17:37.673 --> 00:17:39.505
we'll know what to do next.

253
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.377
That's how it works.

254
00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:45.315
Yeah. um. I think
we should stop seeing these.

255
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.958
But we have to.

256
00:17:47.043 --> 00:17:50.513
We can't finish the quest unless
we figure out the story.

257
00:17:50.662 --> 00:17:53.106
I'm not scared.
I promise.

258
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:54.751
I know.

259
00:17:56.483 --> 00:17:58.533
Do you think Dad's
tower's gonna work?

260
00:17:58.617 --> 00:18:01.453
I don't know. I mean. we'll just
have to wait and see.

261
00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:05.094
Where do you
think this one goes?

262
00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:07.409
Oh. yeah. this is super healthy.

263
00:18:07.494 --> 00:18:08.775
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. Okay.

264
00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:11.811
Okay. We should...
We should stop.

265
00:18:12.202 --> 00:18:14.450
Um. maybe we should
play another game.

266
00:18:14.534 --> 00:18:16.402
What kind of game?

267
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:19.059
Um...

268
00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:21.391
Okay.

269
00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:24.493
A game called
"When I get home. I..."

270
00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:26.638
And we just say whatever
we're looking forward to

271
00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:28.497
the most about getting home.

272
00:18:28.581 --> 00:18:30.400
I'll start.

273
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:33.975
When I get home. I...

274
00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:37.913
I will go to Giovelli's

275
00:18:37.997 --> 00:18:40.652
and I will order...

276
00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:42.511
everything on that menu.

277
00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:44.953
Maybe two of everything
on the menu.

278
00:18:45.037 --> 00:18:46.614
Your turn. Jules.

279
00:18:46.698 --> 00:18:48.990
This is stupid.

280
00:18:49.074 --> 00:18:50.255
Oh. come on. Jules.

281
00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:51.696
Fine.

282
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.045
When I get home.
I'm going to. um...

283
00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:02.168
I'm gonna call my friends and...

284
00:19:02.252 --> 00:19:05.286
I'm just gonna call them.

285
00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:09.846
What about you?

286
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.047
When I get home. I...

287
00:19:13.131 --> 00:19:15.885
I want us to be happy.
like we are here.

288
00:19:15.969 --> 00:19:19.366
We never play games
around the table at home.

289
00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:28.392
Okay. look.

290
00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:32.462
most of these batteries are way
past their expiration date.

291
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.805
All right. we've got the
newer batteries from my car

292
00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:38.484
and that giant lunchbox that
you guys were driving. but...

293
00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:42.010
even those'd drain
in a couple of hours.

294
00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:44.914
We need something that'll
keep this running for days

295
00:19:44.998 --> 00:19:48.214
or weeks. right? Not hours.

296
00:19:48.298 --> 00:19:50.018
What we do is we-we
take the batteries.

297
00:19:50.102 --> 00:19:51.822
we put 'em in the cars
and then we just run the cars

298
00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:53.087
to recharge them.

299
00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:54.550
And then what?
Burn how much fuel?

300
00:19:54.634 --> 00:19:56.552
Look. the point is.
you're either burning out

301
00:19:56.636 --> 00:19:58.191
one vital resource or another.

302
00:19:58.275 --> 00:20:00.523
which would be fine if this
was guaranteed to work.

303
00:20:00.607 --> 00:20:02.393
but let's be honest.
man. it probably won't!

304
00:20:02.477 --> 00:20:04.395
Hey. Keep it down.

305
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:15.912
Has anyone seen Victor?

306
00:20:15.996 --> 00:20:18.409
Look. if you would just
take a look at the symbol.

307
00:20:18.493 --> 00:20:20.444
Open the book!

308
00:20:20.528 --> 00:20:23.084
What is wrong with you?

309
00:20:23.168 --> 00:20:26.367
We have a legitimate chance here
to go home and you're...

310
00:20:31.704 --> 00:20:33.622
You know what?
Just go.

311
00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:36.295
Go.
Go. go find Victor.

312
00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:38.297
Do whatever you want.

313
00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:41.531
I'll stay here. and I'll
figure this out myself.

314
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.989
There's nothing to figure out.
There's no power source.

315
00:20:45.861 --> 00:20:47.471
Jim. this isn't
Gilligan's Island.

316
00:20:47.555 --> 00:20:50.144
You're not gonna build a radio
with palm leaves and coconuts.

317
00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:52.657
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

318
00:20:57.334 --> 00:20:58.839
Whatever.

319
00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:14.855
What do you want?

320
00:21:16.551 --> 00:21:18.942
I. uh...
I heard what happened.

321
00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:21.076
You okay?

322
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.194
Not my bathroom
the asshole hung himself in.

323
00:21:26.363 --> 00:21:28.149
Shouldn't you be out there

324
00:21:28.233 --> 00:21:30.580
rounding up supplies
or building a spaceship

325
00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.021
or some shit?

326
00:21:32.105 --> 00:21:33.352
I'm just saying. if...

327
00:21:33.436 --> 00:21:34.875
if you
want someone to talk to...

328
00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:38.159
Oh. so. now you're sheriff.

329
00:21:38.243 --> 00:21:40.194
you're gonna start
doling out words of wisdom?

330
00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:43.131
One thing I always
appreciated about Boyd

331
00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:45.116
is he minded his own business.

332
00:21:47.923 --> 00:21:50.534
Well. I'm gonna take a few
people down to the barn.

333
00:21:50.618 --> 00:21:52.536
salvage some more wood
for the tower.

334
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.845
Maybe if you want to...

335
00:21:53.929 --> 00:21:56.342
come with us or...
I don't know.

336
00:21:56.426 --> 00:21:57.931
You want wood?

337
00:21:59.033 --> 00:22:01.644
We got plenty of wood.

338
00:22:01.728 --> 00:22:03.481
Where are you going?

339
00:22:03.565 --> 00:22:05.532
Let's get wood!

340
00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:08.111
Donna!

341
00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:09.278
Come on!

342
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:11.607
I'm saving you a trip!

343
00:22:11.692 --> 00:22:13.494
Donna!

344
00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:19.312
Donna! Hey!

345
00:22:21.582 --> 00:22:23.203
Hey!

346
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.453
Donna!

347
00:22:24.538 --> 00:22:25.977
Donna! Hey!

348
00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:28.506
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

349
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.013
- Hey!
- Donna. wait. wait. wait!

350
00:22:30.097 --> 00:22:31.447
Oh. calm the fuck down!
I'm not a fuckin' psycho.

351
00:22:31.531 --> 00:22:34.087
You said we needed wood?
Let's get wood.

352
00:22:34.172 --> 00:22:35.664
Wha...?
Okay.

353
00:22:38.311 --> 00:22:39.836
Donna. please.

354
00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:42.917
Better here than any of
that half-rotten shit

355
00:22:43.002 --> 00:22:44.755
you're gonna pull off the barn.

356
00:22:46.338 --> 00:22:48.454
You gonna get her to stop
or you want me to?

357
00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:51.153
Donna. stop! We need...
We need this place intact.

358
00:22:51.256 --> 00:22:53.273
For what? Huh?

359
00:22:53.537 --> 00:22:55.422
We're all going home. right?

360
00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.865
We don't need
this place anymore.

361
00:22:58.026 --> 00:23:01.110
Your glorious tower's
gonna get us all home.

362
00:23:01.194 --> 00:23:04.200
No need to keep
this place standing.

363
00:23:04.285 --> 00:23:08.287
It's not a home anymore.
It's a fucking tomb!

364
00:23:09.829 --> 00:23:11.520
The fuck!

365
00:23:11.605 --> 00:23:12.901
Fuck!

366
00:23:21.643 --> 00:23:23.033
Look. can we please...

367
00:23:23.248 --> 00:23:25.232
Can we please just take
a minute and let's...

368
00:23:25.317 --> 00:23:26.481
Fuck off!

369
00:23:32.297 --> 00:23:33.560
Aw. fuck!

370
00:23:35.228 --> 00:23:38.130
Oh. fuck.
Oh. fuck.

371
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:02.639
It was nice that Ellis came
to see you before you left.

372
00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:05.144
I'm sure he appreciates
what you're doing.

373
00:24:08.252 --> 00:24:10.907
I heard the story about what
happened with your wife.

374
00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:12.801
what you had to do.

375
00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:15.198
We're not gonna talk
about that.

376
00:24:15.283 --> 00:24:17.300
That's okay.

377
00:24:17.385 --> 00:24:19.098
We don't have to. It's...

378
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.556
It's just. in some ways...

379
00:24:24.249 --> 00:24:27.250
you remind me of Nathan.

380
00:24:28.015 --> 00:24:30.848
I mean. you're a lot
more gruff than he was.

381
00:24:30.949 --> 00:24:34.605
But... you always put other
people's needs before your own.

382
00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:37.393
That's how he ended up here.

383
00:24:37.587 --> 00:24:40.176
I don't think he'd like
what we're doing now.

384
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.639
And why is that?

385
00:24:41.723 --> 00:24:44.715
Nathan had a theory
about this place.

386
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.885
If we tried to leave.
if we pushed too hard.

387
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:51.451
then something
would push back.

388
00:24:57.893 --> 00:24:59.910
What is that?

389
00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:05.036
I don't know.

390
00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:18.178
Are you sure it was
coming from this direction?

391
00:25:22.236 --> 00:25:23.544
Let's go.

392
00:25:35.418 --> 00:25:38.161
I thought you said no one
had been out this far before.

393
00:25:41.321 --> 00:25:42.733
No.

394
00:25:47.938 --> 00:25:49.163
What are you doing?

395
00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:52.908
Look. there's
something inside them.

396
00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.009
We gotta get one down.

397
00:25:55.093 --> 00:25:56.186
Just. uh...

398
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.552
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

399
00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:00.949
Maybe we should...

400
00:26:02.774 --> 00:26:03.790
Hey. what's wrong?

401
00:26:03.875 --> 00:26:04.957
Ow!

402
00:26:05.176 --> 00:26:06.427
Ow!

403
00:26:06.512 --> 00:26:07.286
Whoa. Sara.

404
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:09.038
Ow!

405
00:26:09.123 --> 00:26:11.976
Hey. hey. hey.
Hey. you're okay.

406
00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:13.442
- You're okay.
- Ow!

407
00:26:13.527 --> 00:26:14.687
Look at me. Sara.
You're okay.

408
00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:16.315
No! No!

409
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.670
Look...
What's going on?

410
00:26:17.754 --> 00:26:18.564
Sara! Sara!

411
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.070
I can hear them!
I can...

412
00:26:23.154 --> 00:26:24.445
No. no. Talk to me.

413
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:25.974
Talk to me. Talk to me.

414
00:26:26.058 --> 00:26:27.448
No. no. no. no!

415
00:26:27.532 --> 00:26:28.715
No! No!

416
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.312
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!
Don't. don't! No. no!

417
00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:33.573
No. Sara?
No. no. no. Okay.

418
00:26:34.723 --> 00:26:37.144
No. Sara! Sara! Hey!

419
00:26:41.505 --> 00:26:43.442
How's the magic
tower coming?

420
00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.333
You know. all the time
I've been here.

421
00:26:51.418 --> 00:26:53.286
this is first you've
set foot in this place.

422
00:26:56.825 --> 00:27:00.661
Because you serve piss water.
Your distilling is for shit.

423
00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:03.912
At least here.
I can be alone.

424
00:27:05.141 --> 00:27:06.465
Oh.

425
00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:08.676
Kinda feels like
a banner day today.

426
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:11.009
Feel like
I'm holding court.

427
00:27:11.094 --> 00:27:13.408
You mind
giving us a second?

428
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.442
Yeah.

429
00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:18.020
I'll leave this here.

430
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.528
Give me a holler
if you need anything. okay?

431
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.067
Are you okay?

432
00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:33.130
Donna. I know you're
upset about Eric.

433
00:27:33.215 --> 00:27:34.568
but there's
nothing you could have...

434
00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:37.147
Oh. for fuck's sake.
it's not about that.

435
00:27:39.774 --> 00:27:42.145
Eric punched his own ticket.

436
00:27:43.586 --> 00:27:46.098
Kid's got a right to
go out the way he wants.

437
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.529
Why don't you just
fuck off and leave me be.

438
00:27:49.886 --> 00:27:52.950
Go back to your
little fantasy land.

439
00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:55.700
You don't think
the tower's gonna work.

440
00:27:57.886 --> 00:27:59.481
Do you?

441
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:04.194
I think it might.
I think it's worth trying.

442
00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:06.145
And what happens
when you fail?

443
00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:09.697
Then we try again.

444
00:28:09.782 --> 00:28:10.831
No!

445
00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:13.527
No. ya stupid little shit.

446
00:28:13.617 --> 00:28:16.140
That's the point.
You don't try again.

447
00:28:16.497 --> 00:28:18.497
because you got
people's hopes up.

448
00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:20.098
you made them believe.

449
00:28:20.183 --> 00:28:22.728
You take that away now
and they're lost.

450
00:28:22.813 --> 00:28:26.353
they give up.
and then they fucking die.

451
00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:31.895
'Cause it isn't some
grade-school softball game

452
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.162
where everyone gets
a participation medal.

453
00:28:34.737 --> 00:28:36.765
You don't know!

454
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.115
You don't remember
what it was like before

455
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.563
because you weren't here.

456
00:28:44.131 --> 00:28:46.677
You wanna know
what I'm grieving?

457
00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:51.707
I'm grieving the loss of what
we almost made this place.

458
00:28:52.048 --> 00:28:55.165
I'm grieving the fact that.
for a little while.

459
00:28:55.274 --> 00:28:57.731
this place almost felt like
something that could work.

460
00:28:57.815 --> 00:29:01.592
I am grieving the fact that
you guys are so caught up

461
00:29:01.677 --> 00:29:04.331
in playing Mr. Fucking Wizard
that you can't see

462
00:29:04.482 --> 00:29:07.482
what this place is
gonna become when you fail.

463
00:29:16.944 --> 00:29:20.534
So. what are
we supposed to do?

464
00:29:21.505 --> 00:29:22.722
What are we supposed to do?

465
00:29:22.807 --> 00:29:25.084
Just sit here
and not try to go home?

466
00:29:26.272 --> 00:29:28.197
Live in a place where
those things come to hunt us

467
00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:29.373
every single night?

468
00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:32.029
Oh. God. the fuck...

469
00:29:32.113 --> 00:29:33.701
Why not?

470
00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:36.436
At least here.
the monsters have the decency

471
00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:38.574
to show you what they are.

472
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.920
I know you guys from town
look at Colony House

473
00:29:49.005 --> 00:29:52.216
and figure it's all just
drinking and fucking.

474
00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:55.325
But it was more than that.

475
00:29:56.575 --> 00:29:58.867
It was special.

476
00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:03.630
All those people from
all those different places.

477
00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:06.575
different lives.
everyone living together.

478
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.834
For all the fear

479
00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:12.267
and all the
monsters-in-the-forest bullshit.

480
00:30:12.351 --> 00:30:13.865
there was something.

481
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.880
there was a joy in that house.

482
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.349
For a little while. anyways.

483
00:30:22.957 --> 00:30:26.873
And. like most things.
none of us appreciated it

484
00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:30.646
nearly as much as we should
have. and now it's fucking gone.

485
00:30:38.594 --> 00:30:39.835
I'm sorry.

486
00:30:41.446 --> 00:30:43.029
Yeah.

487
00:30:44.566 --> 00:30:45.972
Me. too.

488
00:30:55.232 --> 00:30:59.139
Look. I'm gonna put
my game face

489
00:30:59.255 --> 00:31:01.083
back on tomorrow.

490
00:31:01.372 --> 00:31:04.232
and we'll give
that tower a shot.

491
00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:12.195
But you have to be prepared for
the fallout if it doesn't work.

492
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.975
And if it does work...

493
00:31:17.227 --> 00:31:20.778
I think you'll find there's
more you're gonna miss

494
00:31:20.863 --> 00:31:23.388
about this place
than you thought.

495
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:43.023
That kinda day. huh?

496
00:31:46.372 --> 00:31:49.272
Just ironing out a few wrinkles.
that's all.

497
00:31:49.357 --> 00:31:50.886
Yeah.

498
00:31:50.971 --> 00:31:53.169
Where's Jade?

499
00:31:53.254 --> 00:31:57.845
He's. uh...
I don't know.

500
00:31:57.929 --> 00:31:59.242
Okay?

501
00:31:59.326 --> 00:32:01.409
Donna did a number
on the floor.

502
00:32:01.493 --> 00:32:03.081
Yeah.

503
00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:05.951
She knows how to wield an axe.
I'll give her that.

504
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:17.165
Well. better
get back to it.

505
00:32:17.344 --> 00:32:20.769
So. we got that coil
for the CB that you needed.

506
00:32:20.853 --> 00:32:23.134
and we should have enough
wire stripped for the cord.

507
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:25.301
That's great.

508
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.936
Is it?

509
00:32:27.021 --> 00:32:29.107
Well. yeah.
I mean. look.

510
00:32:29.192 --> 00:32:31.847
I'm not gonna stand here and
pretend that it was a great day.

511
00:32:32.529 --> 00:32:35.619
These are setbacks.
nothing more.

512
00:32:35.703 --> 00:32:38.050
Look. you got what we
need for the radio.

513
00:32:38.135 --> 00:32:42.162
tower's almost finished.
and I'm gonna figure this out.

514
00:32:42.341 --> 00:32:43.779
How?

515
00:32:43.864 --> 00:32:45.727
Well. that
I don't know.

516
00:32:45.812 --> 00:32:49.755
But one thing you learn as an
engineer: There's always a way.

517
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:53.255
We will figure this out.

518
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:24.508
Hey.

519
00:33:27.652 --> 00:33:29.196
Hey.

520
00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:30.990
Are you okay?

521
00:33:34.991 --> 00:33:36.810
Eric was a friend.

522
00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:41.475
Oh God. I'm...
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.833
I-I didn't know that
you guys were close.

524
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.341
He had celiac disease.

525
00:33:49.139 --> 00:33:51.380
so he came to the clinic a lot.

526
00:33:51.465 --> 00:33:53.763
He was always bloated
and dehydrated.

527
00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:57.498
I kept telling him
to stop eating bread.

528
00:33:58.138 --> 00:34:01.661
But he always said things like.
"I'm already in shitsville.

529
00:34:01.745 --> 00:34:04.099
"now you want me
to give up carbs?"

530
00:34:04.924 --> 00:34:07.073
He just had this way
about him. you know?

531
00:34:07.372 --> 00:34:10.872
He was one of the people that.
when I first got here. he...

532
00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:15.536
just made it a lot easier.

533
00:34:17.587 --> 00:34:22.062
And now he's gone. so...

534
00:34:29.653 --> 00:34:31.362
Hey. Kristi...

535
00:34:31.447 --> 00:34:35.786
Look. I know you've had
a hard time lately.

536
00:34:35.955 --> 00:34:39.204
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody.

537
00:34:39.288 --> 00:34:42.009
and you feel like it's
your responsibility now...

538
00:34:42.093 --> 00:34:43.483
- Kristi. I...
- But I just need you

539
00:34:43.567 --> 00:34:45.254
to promise me. okay?

540
00:34:47.055 --> 00:34:51.613
If it falls apart.
if you fall apart.

541
00:34:51.892 --> 00:34:56.142
just promise me.
you'll come to me.

542
00:34:56.305 --> 00:34:58.256
you'll talk to me.

543
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.307
you'll let me help.

544
00:35:03.708 --> 00:35:05.642
I promise you.

545
00:35:08.209 --> 00:35:10.818
Hey. I promise you.

546
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.505
Come here.
Come on.

547
00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:23.693
It's okay.

548
00:35:26.273 --> 00:35:28.829
People just don't
understand what it's like.

549
00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.193
I mean. it's not like
you can take a nickel

550
00:35:32.278 --> 00:35:35.115
and suddenly make it
worth 10 cents!

551
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.474
Aw. it doesn't matter.
You know why?

552
00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:43.897
Because Jade is a genius.
Jade'll figure it out. You...

553
00:35:43.982 --> 00:35:45.044
Let me tell you something.

554
00:35:45.129 --> 00:35:47.646
you have no idea
how much pressure that is.

555
00:35:47.895 --> 00:35:49.175
to be the one that everybody

556
00:35:49.259 --> 00:35:51.974
just assumes can fix a...

557
00:35:53.274 --> 00:35:55.093
an unfixable problem!

558
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.404
Oh. and then...

559
00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:00.029
Then. you've got
Mr. Tea Cups sauntering in

560
00:36:00.114 --> 00:36:05.513
with his big white horse
and his blue eyes and his.

561
00:36:05.704 --> 00:36:10.826
"Oh. don't smoke weed.
you degenerate."

562
00:36:11.584 --> 00:36:13.535
Fine. fine.
You know what? Fine.

563
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.622
You think you can fix this?
Go ahead! Fix it!

564
00:36:15.714 --> 00:36:18.701
I'm just dying
to see how it's done. Ha!

565
00:36:18.786 --> 00:36:20.341
<i>Speaks Cantonese...</i>

566
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:22.043
You so much complain!

567
00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.606
Complain. complain!

568
00:36:24.705 --> 00:36:26.444
Stop complain!

569
00:36:26.529 --> 00:36:29.216
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

570
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.521
You need electric?

571
00:36:32.382 --> 00:36:33.546
Yeah.

572
00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:48.666
The problem is you can't
plug anything in.

573
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.008
I mean. it'd be one thing
if it was just.

574
00:36:53.092 --> 00:36:56.041
you know. like a pan we
could throw on the stove.

575
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.049
God knows.

576
00:36:58.134 --> 00:37:01.033
whatever's coming up through
those wires is still...

577
00:37:10.505 --> 00:37:12.643
Holy shit.
I know how to do it.

578
00:37:16.639 --> 00:37:17.655
Hello?

579
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.455
We're down here!

580
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.105
Hi.

581
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.075
How did it go
with the tower?

582
00:37:27.377 --> 00:37:28.833
Uh. good.

583
00:37:28.971 --> 00:37:30.922
I think things are
really shaping up.

584
00:37:31.328 --> 00:37:33.424
You're a pretty bad liar.

585
00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:36.972
Thanks.
I'll add that to the list.

586
00:37:37.938 --> 00:37:39.700
It's gonna work.

587
00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:46.230
The tower.
it's gonna work.

588
00:37:46.423 --> 00:37:48.638
What's got you
feeling so optimistic?

589
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.127
I don't know.

590
00:37:51.025 --> 00:37:53.515
I was just thinking about
something Ethan said.

591
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.814
What was that?

592
00:37:54.953 --> 00:37:57.168
What if we were
supposed to come here?

593
00:37:57.705 --> 00:38:00.408
I don't know. it's weird. but...

594
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.869
back home.
we never talked anymore.

595
00:38:03.954 --> 00:38:05.146
We just...

596
00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:07.610
And now.
we're together again.

597
00:38:07.694 --> 00:38:09.752
like. we're really together.

598
00:38:09.837 --> 00:38:12.514
And it's...

599
00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:15.213
it's like Fatima said to me
on my first night.

600
00:38:15.611 --> 00:38:17.252
"If you climb up high enough.

601
00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:19.787
even a nightmare can
look like a dream."

602
00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:21.871
Wise words.

603
00:38:23.504 --> 00:38:27.864
So. how about you forget about
your tower for a little while

604
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.998
and come help us dig our hole?

605
00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.184
Deal.

606
00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:04.964
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

607
00:39:05.048 --> 00:39:08.341
Hey. it's okay.
It's okay. Come on.

608
00:39:10.274 --> 00:39:13.160
It's okay.
It's okay. Come on.

609
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.361
There.
There. there you go.

610
00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.350
There you go.

611
00:39:17.785 --> 00:39:19.488
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.

612
00:39:22.643 --> 00:39:24.165
Where are we?

613
00:39:24.564 --> 00:39:26.971
Don't worry. We're safe.

614
00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:31.529
Is that...?

615
00:39:31.613 --> 00:39:32.729
Oh. yeah.

616
00:39:32.814 --> 00:39:36.635
I. uh...
finally managed to get one down.

617
00:39:36.783 --> 00:39:40.455
and. uh... this was inside.

618
00:39:42.034 --> 00:39:43.713
What does it say?

619
00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:45.765
1864.

620
00:39:47.189 --> 00:39:48.975
That's it.

621
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.557
And. from what I could tell.

622
00:39:52.337 --> 00:39:54.387
every bottle up there seems
to have a slip of paper

623
00:39:54.471 --> 00:39:56.405
just like this.

624
00:39:57.247 --> 00:39:59.080
I think we should go back.

625
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.807
What?

626
00:40:03.391 --> 00:40:05.144
The voice I heard.

627
00:40:05.416 --> 00:40:07.424
it was different this time.

628
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.268
It was a woman and...

629
00:40:11.746 --> 00:40:13.829
and she was screaming.

630
00:40:14.117 --> 00:40:15.650
She said...

631
00:40:18.016 --> 00:40:20.330
She said that she was wrong.

632
00:40:20.492 --> 00:40:24.635
that we shouldn't have come.
that there are things out here

633
00:40:24.831 --> 00:40:27.150
that are worse
than the monsters.

634
00:40:27.235 --> 00:40:30.121
She kept saying...

635
00:40:30.286 --> 00:40:32.369
What?
She kept saying what?

636
00:40:32.641 --> 00:40:34.518
I don't know.

637
00:40:35.512 --> 00:40:37.557
It doesn't make any sense.

638
00:40:38.779 --> 00:40:39.927
She kept saying.

639
00:40:40.011 --> 00:40:42.105
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

640
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:43.650
that I was wrong."

641
00:40:46.237 --> 00:40:47.744
What?

642
00:40:53.938 --> 00:40:55.691
What is that?

643
00:40:55.915 --> 00:40:57.424
I don't know.

644
00:41:12.883 --> 00:41:15.519
What's happening?

645
00:41:15.604 --> 00:41:16.799
I don't know.

646
00:41:30.517 --> 00:41:34.503
There's drawings of scarecrows

647
00:41:34.618 --> 00:41:36.569
and bogeymen. giant spiders.

648
00:41:36.654 --> 00:41:38.951
This is definitely a quest.

649
00:41:43.627 --> 00:41:45.050
What is it?

650
00:41:45.345 --> 00:41:47.416
Keep digging. keep digging!

651
00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:48.963
I think I hit the bottom.

652
00:41:49.047 --> 00:41:50.206
Oh. my God.

653
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.698
Here. here.
Let me help.

654
00:41:51.783 --> 00:41:53.275
Hey!

655
00:41:55.169 --> 00:41:56.955
Get in!

656
00:42:04.116 --> 00:42:06.175
Are you... are you...

657
00:42:17.944 --> 00:42:20.714
Hey. where's the talisman?

658
00:42:22.803 --> 00:42:25.249
W-Where's the talisman?

659
00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.479
Here!

660
00:42:42.076 --> 00:42:43.432
We shouldn't have come here.

661
00:42:43.517 --> 00:42:44.854
Shh!

662
00:42:44.948 --> 00:42:47.377
We're okay. We're okay.

663
00:42:47.462 --> 00:42:49.644
No.

664
00:42:50.028 --> 00:42:51.962
I don't think we are.
