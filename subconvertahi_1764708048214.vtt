﻿1
00:01:57.624 --> 00:01:59.711
Move! Move!

2
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.586
Hands! Let me see your hands!

3
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.090
- Jesus Christ. that's Hermann Göring.
- Who?

4
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.990
Hitler's second-in-command.
With fear and waiting.

5
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.130
What did he say?

6
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.536
He asked us to get his luggage.

7
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.456
Justice Jackson?

8
00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:54.310
That depends on if you have a good reason
to be banging on my door at three o'clock.

9
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.050
They captured Hermann Göring alive.

10
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.250
- Where?
- Austria.

11
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.806
What are they going to do with him?

12
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.110
Well. that's the real question. isn't it?
Can I come in?

13
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.050
- No.
- But it's raining.

14
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.790
I can see that.
Are they going to shoot him?

15
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.130
Not that I know of.

16
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.430
Well. for a long time they
were going to shoot him.

17
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.990
Yes. sir.

18
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.290
Churchill and Roosevelt
signed the order themselves.

19
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.470
On order that you oppose.

20
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.810
I'm a Supreme Court Justice. I tend to
frown on executing men without a trial.

21
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.530
That's what I'm here to talk about.

22
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.850
It can't be done.

23
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.210
- You keep saying that.
- Because it can't be done.

24
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.770
Give me one good reason why not.

25
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.036
There's no legal precedent for a trial.

26
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.750
There's no international
law to base the charges on.

27
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.950
No one has ever tried war criminals
outside of one nation's jurisdiction

28
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:45.213
because the whole
concept of international law is

29
00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:48.910
that one country can't tell another
country's citizens how to conduct themselves.

30
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.270
Elsie.

31
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.210
Trying these men in a
German court would be different.

32
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.559
But what you're talking
about is trying them

33
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.810
in some sort of legal
limbo that doesn't exist

34
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.190
using case law that
hasn't been written yet.

35
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:01.246
And on the off chance
that you're not keeping

36
00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:03.370
track. that's about four
good reasons why not.

37
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.470
I'm getting you a drink.

38
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.690
I don't want a drink.

39
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.090
Then I'm getting me another
and getting you one for show.

40
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.330
Who do you put on trial?

41
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.350
The German commanders? Enlisted men?

42
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.290
What about the judges
who enforce the racial codes?

43
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.266
Obviously we'd have to work that out.

44
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.950
And once you decide who to put on
trial. what do you charge them with?

45
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.230
Conspiracy to wage
aggressive war on the world.

46
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.210
And you want the United States
to argue that as prosecution?

47
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.890
I do.

48
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.050
Against Germany?
A country that never attacked us?

49
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.860
Say just for a second it could be done.

50
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.260
- Robert.
- Don't you want to know how I'd do it?

51
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.140
It would have to be a
completely international effort.

52
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.280
All of the allies would
have to participate.

53
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.560
The US. Britain. France. Russia.
You can't do it without the Russians.

54
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.000
Four international judges.

55
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.900
You're talking about a tribunal.

56
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.880
Exactly.
The world needs to know what these men did.

57
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.540
It's a logistical nightmare.

58
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.800
I know.

59
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.440
But it has to be done.

60
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.900
Pick a card.

61
00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:51.258
I don't think so.

62
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.340
Ask me to pick one.

63
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
Pick a card.

64
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.300
Now ask me to please remember
it and put it back in the deck.

65
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.200
Please remember it and
put it back in the deck.

66
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.430
Now shuffle.

67
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.690
Now what?

68
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.750
My card was a three of spades.

69
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.330
- Oh. that's hardly a trick.
- Turn over the top one.

70
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.050
Who are you?

71
00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.590
I'm a psychiatrist.

72
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.910
Oh. and why are you going to Mondorf?

73
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.270
I wish I knew.

74
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.090
They send psychiatrists
on secret missions now.

75
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.450
I'm pretty sure I'm the first.

76
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.080
How did you do that?

77
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960
With the cards?

78
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.020
I didn't do anything.

79
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.760
You're a really good magician.

80
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640
Dr. Kelly.

81
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.880
Sgt. Howie Triest at your service.

82
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.240
I'm going to run you under
the commandant's office.

83
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.000
- Tigers. huh?
- Yes. sir.

84
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.340
Perhaps I'll see you around.

85
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600
Jiminy.

86
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.020
Who is that?

87
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.800
That Howie was a very attractive woman.

88
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960
She's a commandant.

89
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.440
Ah. yes. sir. Colonel Andrews.

90
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.840
So can you tell me what I'm
supposed to be doing here?

91
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.480
I thought the war was over.

92
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.740
I couldn't say.

93
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.366
You couldn't say because
you don't know. or you

94
00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:11.640
couldn't say because somebody
told you you couldn't say?

95
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.100
I couldn't say.

96
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.540
Don't get sore with me. Doc.
I'm just a translator.

97
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.960
Translator for what?

98
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.700
We'll see.

99
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.340
Dr. Kelly.

100
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.600
Apparently Central Command thinks
you're some kind of hotshot head-shrinker.

101
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.040
I imagine you have some questions for me.

102
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.160
More than a few.
Let's get to it.

103
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.680
You are standing inside
a secret military prison.

104
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.020
It currently houses what's
left of the Nazi high command.

105
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.990
The governments of Russia. France.
Great Britain. and our United States

106
00:09:51.002 --> 00:09:54.840
are deciding right now whether to
put these men on trial for their lives.

107
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.220
You have been brought
in to inspect and ensure the

108
00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:01.420
prisoners' mental health
should that trial go forward.

109
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Suicide.

110
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.020
That'll be the main concern
with most of the prisoners.

111
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.080
Hitler. Goebbels. and Himmler
have already taken their own lives.

112
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.560
We cannot afford any more losses.

113
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.780
Goebbels and Himmler did it with this.

114
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.440
Hidden cyanide capsule.

115
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.860
The one you'll have to
watch the closest is Göring.

116
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.293
Göring?

117
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.640
Why isn't Hermann Göring?

118
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.820
That's the one.

119
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Hermann Göring's here?

120
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.768
Sergeant. is it possible
that he made you suffer

121
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.760
a large blow to his head
on the way to my office?

122
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.160
Not that I'm aware of. sir.

123
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.860
Sorry. it's just a lot to process.

124
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.120
- I'm sure it is. Try and do it faster.
- Yes. sir.

125
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.660
When Göring surrendered.
he was traveling with his family.

126
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.370
He had over a million
dollars in German currency

127
00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:47.160
and jewelry. and a
large quantity of these.

128
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.900
We had them sent back to
the States for classification.

129
00:10:50.926 --> 00:10:52.520
Hydrocodeine.

130
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.040
Fairly potent painkiller. I'm a fan.

131
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.300
He says they're for his heart.

132
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.480
Well. then. I have a rather large
bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

133
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.900
These have nothing to do with the heart.
They're an opiate.

134
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.260
How many pills does he take a day?

135
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.540
Sergeant. forty. sir.

136
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.880
Well. I think it's safe to say the
Reichsmarschall's got a drug problem.

137
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.980
Where's his family now?

138
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.160
They've been released.
and they're not your concern.

139
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.160
Your only job is to evaluate
Göring and the others. That is it.

140
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.717
Sir. I'm a good doctor. but
the entire Nazi high command

141
00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:29.720
might be a little bit beyond
my area of expertise.

142
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.180
Believe me. Major. this was not my idea.

143
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:35.381
Dismissed.

144
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.770
He was not great about tox. is he?

145
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.570
Kalman's not known for his warmth. sir.

146
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.710
What are you doing?

147
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.770
Göring. Right now.

148
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.230
- You don't want to get settled first?
- I want to know what I'm dealing with.

149
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.306
All right. well. don't be too intimidating.

150
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.630
I'm not. Tell me about it.

151
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.110
Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. President
of the Reichstag. Minister of Aviation.

152
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.690
Commandant-in-Chief of the
Luftwaffe. Minister of Economics.

153
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.450
a founding member of
the Kastafel secret police.

154
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.770
was appointed Hitler's successor in 1939

155
00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:11.150
and is the highest ranking
German military officer of all time.

156
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.170
Okay.
Now I'm a little intimidated.

157
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.990
Don't be. You're good.

158
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.110
Reichsmarschall!

159
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.190
Reichsmarschall Göring. my
name is Dr. Douglas Kelly.

160
00:12:28.196 --> 00:12:30.330
My name is Dr. Douglas Kelly.

161
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.070
He says. wonderful. a doctor.

162
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.030
I am. I'm going to take your pulse.

163
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.860
Yeah. yeah.

164
00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:45.550
He's been asking for his pills.

165
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.250
He wants you to get them for him.

166
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.690
I understand you've had heart trouble.

167
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.450
Can you open your shirt. please?

168
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.050
Respiration is rapid and shallow.
Don't translate that.

169
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.410
The pills help with the pain as well.

170
00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:26.296
He says he was shot down in World War I.

171
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.030
He has a bullet in his right hip.

172
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.250
In 1923 he was shot in the
groin during the Munich pooch.

173
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.850
You've been shot a lot. sir.

174
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.210
Occupational hazard.

175
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.750
Well. if you really want
to look after your heart.

176
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.930
the best way to do that
is to lose some weight.

177
00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:58.510
I'm assure you are looking at the
best physique in all of Germany.

178
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.150
Just ask my wife.

179
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.930
Oh. I'm sure you're right. sir. but
the guards here call you fat stuff.

180
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.400
I'm sure it would be difficult for
a lesser man to lose this weight.

181
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.460
but you possess a fortitude and
discipline that others do not. yes?

182
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.820
You see. this man is different.

183
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.600
We're going to be good
friends. I'm sure of it.

184
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.080
I look forward to that.

185
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.840
- Good day.
- Auf Wiedersehen.

186
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.790
Inflated sense of self.

187
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.010
Charming.

188
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.990
Speaks English.

189
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.890
What? What? What? What?

190
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.930
The way he looked at
me when I called him fat.

191
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.670
He understood me. He's been playing you.

192
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.570
No. no. why would he pretend?

193
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.550
Translation gives him more
time to consider his answers.

194
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.430
He thinks that gives him an advantage.

195
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.410
Wait. hold on.

196
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.730
You're saying I spent
the last three months

197
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:15.751
mumbling to myself while
he understood everyone?

198
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.790
Pretty much.

199
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.090
Are you going to tell him that you know?

200
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.750
No. no.
He's going to tell me when he's ready.

201
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.270
- When's that?
- When he determines I'm not a threat.

202
00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:30.870
I want to meet the rest of them.
Who's next?

203
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.930
Dr. Robert Ley. chief of
the German labor front.

204
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.210
one of Hitler's earliest followers.

205
00:15:39.143 --> 00:15:40.866
He once wrote a book
that was so complimentary

206
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.086
that Hitler had the entire run destroyed
because he was so embarrassed.

207
00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:50.630
Ley. who spearheaded the Nazi slave
labor program. was captured in his pajamas.

208
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.250
calling himself Dr. Distelmaier.

209
00:15:58.261 --> 00:16:02.170
I'm not like these other power-hungry
men you have locked up in here.

210
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.330
I can smell the Jew.

211
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.650
Great admiral Karl Dönitz.

212
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.770
the German navy's commander in chief.

213
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.871
architect of the U-boat attack
that crippled the British navy.

214
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.330
The fanatical Nazi
with the arrest of Dönitz.

215
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.750
The Third Reich is ended forever.

216
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.070
I've been in custody for 76 days.

217
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.790
I have yet to be formally arrested
or charged with a specific crime.

218
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.490
which is a direct violation
of the Geneva Convention.

219
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.270
Charge me or release me.

220
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.230
Julius Streicher.

221
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.790
Hitler's director of propaganda.

222
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.030
publisher of the national
anti-Semitic paper. De Sturma.

223
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.370
Streicher. docked the high priest of
anti-Semitism and the beast of Franconia.

224
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.930
led the Jewish boycott

225
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.510
and ruled Nuremberg with an iron fist.

226
00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:04.696
He wants to know if you're a Jew.

227
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.670
No.

228
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.670
But you work in a Jewish profession.

229
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.530
What do you fight for. doctor?

230
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.560
Göring is the key.

231
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.320
A leader of a nation in exile.

232
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.920
He binds them all together.

233
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.760
He's begun a strict
self-imposed diet and exercise

234
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.580
regimen and is going
cold turkey on the pills.

235
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.820
It's almost as if he's
training for something.

236
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.051
If one were to write a book about him. it-

237
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.806
Is there a library in town?

238
00:17:58.231 --> 00:17:59.856
- You want to go to a libray?
- Yes!

239
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.930
- At 2:33 in the morning?
- Yes. get your coat.

240
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.530
I'll get my coat.

241
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.710
The sheer amount of narcissists
we got locked up in that hotel.

242
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.250
I bet at least half have books in here

243
00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:16.590
written about them or written by them.

244
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.810
We're going to figure these guys out.

245
00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:22.002
Do you speak any German. doc?

246
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.930
Not even a little.

247
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.090
How'd you learn?

248
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.430
My mother spoke German.

249
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.070
I wanted to be like her.

250
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.170
You really think you can do it?

251
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.530
Do what?

252
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.390
Well. get these guys to open up to you.

253
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.830
Sure.

254
00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.330
Ow.

255
00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:45.090
Everybody wants to be listened to.

256
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.250
It's a natural instinct.

257
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.830
I learn about them.

258
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.910
I get them to trust me.

259
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980
They open up.

260
00:18:54.305 --> 00:18:55.430
I make it sound so easy.

261
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.250
What if we could dissect evil?

262
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.070
What sets these men apart from all others?

263
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.010
What enabled them to
commit the crimes that they did?

264
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.870
It almost took over the world.

265
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.890
You've heard about the work camps for Jews?

266
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.440
Rumor has it

267
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.750
they weren't just work camps.

268
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.620
I've heard.

269
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.880
So how do people become like that?

270
00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:25.180
We actually have a shot to figure that out.

271
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.520
To find out

272
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.840
what makes the Germans different.

273
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.060
Different?

274
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.860
From us.

275
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.180
A man who writes a book about
that can make a lot of money.

276
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.800
You know. for a second I
thought you were being noble.

277
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.590
You aren't noble?

278
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480
Fine.

279
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.520
We could psychologically define evil.

280
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.320
We could make sure something
like this never happens again.

281
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.480
What's going on?

282
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.800
Hermann Göring can't breathe.

283
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480
Move!

284
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.620
Hallie!

285
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.100
His airway is clear.

286
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:32.840
That's good. right?

287
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.200
And he's having a heart attack.

288
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:35.640
Without the prison doctor.

289
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.280
He's on his way.

290
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.180
Tell him to hurry.

291
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.580
Hallie. get some aspirin.

292
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.740
Plain old ordinary aspirin.

293
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.400
You're going to not go.

294
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.700
Hey. hey.

295
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.160
Your heart's still beating.

296
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.500
Which means you're alive.

297
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.040
I'm going to keep you that way.

298
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.660
I need you to stay calm.

299
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.420
Breathe with me.

300
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.480
In and out.

301
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.480
In and out.

302
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.340
I'm here.

303
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:53.940
I'm here.

304
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.460
Look at me.

305
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.100
I'm here. I'm not going to let you die.

306
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.340
In and out.

307
00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:02.560
Is that your wife?

308
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.080
She's here.

309
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600
She's here.

310
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480
Breathe with me.

311
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.840
Hand me a few of those. Hallie.

312
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
Thank you. Hallie.

313
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.620
Best thing for the heart.

314
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.360
Trust me.

315
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.560
Breathe in and out.

316
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.540
Your pulse is slow.

317
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.700
Hey. guess what?

318
00:21:31.701 --> 00:21:32.701
You're alive.

319
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:33.760
You're alive.

320
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.420
I am.

321
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.780
Well. how about that?

322
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200
Thank you.

323
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.820
Let's get him to the infomerica. mon.

324
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.140
He smiled for it.

325
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.100
He said thank you in English.

326
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.580
Truman wants to win reelection in 48.

327
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.020
He's not going to do
that coddling of the Nazis.

328
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.380
That's true enough.

329
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.160
Plus. a trial means giving them a
chance to tell their stories to the world.

330
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.800
What are we afraid to hear them tell?

331
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.460
We won the damn war. Bob.

332
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.160
If you do this. it'll turn into the
biggest boondoggle of all time.

333
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.816
Cameras in the damn courtroom.

334
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.200
Well. what if they're sympathetic?

335
00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.901
What if all this does
is provide them with a

336
00:22:30.913 --> 00:22:33.300
platform for antisemitism
all over the world?

337
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.560
You won't be responsible for that.

338
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.700
You want to know if I'm comfortable
executing a few dances without trial?

339
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.680
Damn right I am.

340
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.360
It doesn't matter anyway.

341
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.540
I'll never get the Russians.

342
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.260
We got the Russians.

343
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.460
What?

344
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.220
We got the Russians.

345
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.460
We did?

346
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.720
Truman called Stalin himself. looking
at Nikichenko for lead prosecutor.

347
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.420
That's fantastic news.

348
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.900
I have no idea who you are.

349
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.350
Colonel John Ammons. sir.
I work for the Judge Advocate General.

350
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.400
So. the Army sent us a lawyer.

351
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.838
Yes. sir. I bring greetings from
General Eisenhower. who says he

352
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.760
wants you to know that he's not
for hanging anyone without a trial.

353
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Well. that's progress.

354
00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:22.093
He also says he
hopes the trial won't take

355
00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:23.885
too long so we can get
on with hanging them.

356
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720
Have a seat.

357
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.200
I've read a lot about you. sir. They say
you're going to be the next Chief Justice.

358
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.300
The President promised
him the seat personally.

359
00:23:33.301 --> 00:23:35.989
And swore me into secrecy.
so let's maybe not tell

360
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:38.700
everyone who walks into
the office about it. okay?

361
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.720
Well. everyone in my office says
there's no way you get the trial.

362
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.860
What do you say?

363
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.720
I say I like an underdog.

364
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.340
Good morning. Julius.

365
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.308
I'm going to show you a series
of cards. each with ink blots.

366
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.400
and you're going to tell me
what each ink blot makes you see.

367
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.757
Perhaps it will reveal something
about your character. your

368
00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:04.900
intelligence. creativity. and
everything here stays between us.

369
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.310
A doctor?

370
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.810
Yes.

371
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.770
I can't speak to you in
English if it is of some help.

372
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.510
Only if it makes you comfortable.

373
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.990
Shall we begin?

374
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.730
I'm calling you.

375
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.530
I'm Hexen.

376
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.190
This is your director. Torpedo Trevor.

377
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.650
Torpedo Head.

378
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.270
Somebody has spilled something.

379
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:40.590
I see 10.000 horses.
I see the Valkyries ride.

380
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.870
A vagina.

381
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.710
A vagina?

382
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.260
A vagina?

383
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.330
A Jewish vagina.

384
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.550
A Jewish vagina.

385
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.130
This is blood.

386
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.550
This is blood.

387
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.110
Or ink.

388
00:25:00.955 --> 00:25:02.470
You can say a lot of things with ink.

389
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.610
I'm sorry. Bob. Word came down tonight.
It's going to be a no.

390
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.610
Congress is going to say no to the trial.
They just want executions.

391
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.010
I'm out of moves.

392
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.910
What about the president?

393
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.010
The president wants someone to hide behind.
That's why he needs Congress.

394
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.590
Neither will do it without the other.

395
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.870
So you need someone bigger to back it?

396
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.090
Oh. come on.
Who's bigger than the president?

397
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.000
Jesus Christ.

398
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.220
Literally.

399
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120
Are you a Catholic?

400
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540
I am now.

401
00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:53.800
The Holy Father will see you now.

402
00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.220
You wish to put this
man on trial for their lives.

403
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.060
Then you have come to ask
for the Church's blessing in this.

404
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.560
Your support would go a long way
to building an international consensus.

405
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.040
No one denies these men are evil.

406
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.360
But an eye for an eye is not the answer.

407
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.380
Maybe not. but I'm pretty
sure where I first read about it.

408
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.820
Are you Catholic?

409
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.700
No. sir.

410
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960
A religious man?

411
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.020
Not especially.

412
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.240
And yet at home they call you a justice.

413
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.870
I didn't pick the name.

414
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.440
If you sit long enough
in judgment of others.

415
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.960
you come to believe the laws
of man outweigh the laws of God.

416
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
I don't believe that.

417
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.900
Then what do you believe?

418
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:58.320
I believe in man in our capacity to
save ourselves from men like the Nazis.

419
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.600
I believe this to be a good act.

420
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.340
Once so good. you must
circumnavigate your own laws to achieve it.

421
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.040
I'm sorry. but the Catholic
Church cannot support you in this.

422
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.850
But you could support them in 1933.

423
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.420
I'm sorry?

424
00:27:24.845 --> 00:27:27.360
You signed the Concordat
with Hitler yourself.

425
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.520
That was a different matter.

426
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.740
You lived in Munich.
You were the nuncio to the German Empire.

427
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.920
The Catholic Church was the first world
power to acknowledge the pure state.

428
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.460
You gave the Nazis credibility.

429
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.240
In order to protect Catholics in Germany.

430
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.900
Isn't it a pity the Jews didn't
have someone to do that for them?

431
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.340
Do you think I condone what they did?

432
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.920
People will remember. sir.

433
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.550
What you did in 1933.

434
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.820
What you do now.

435
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.780
They'll tell their children.

436
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.580
Did the Catholic Church
stand with the Nazis?

437
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:20.840
Or against them?

438
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.880
Did you just blackmail the Pope?

439
00:28:28.881 --> 00:28:31.080
I don't want to talk about it.

440
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.740
Word came down last night.

441
00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.940
There's going to be a trial.

442
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.330
A trial?

443
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.210
Good.

444
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:47.910
Good.

445
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.910
As it should be.

446
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.620
Those cards that you showed me.

447
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.980
What did they teach you about me?

448
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.610
Honestly. that you are highly intelligent.

449
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.240
I could have told you this.

450
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.640
And that you're a narcissist.

451
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.860
Given to an expansive
and aggressive fantasy life.

452
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.700
With a strong ambition and drive
to subjugate the world as you find it.

453
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.140
To your own pattern of thinking.

454
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.960
And you were surprised by this?

455
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.420
No.

456
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.720
Then the cards have taught you nothing.

457
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.540
Now. Tris. he tells me you do magic.

458
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.740
Einsauber.

459
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200
Sorry.

460
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.620
Perhaps if it's not too much
trouble. we don't get entertainment.

461
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.980
Why not?

462
00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.440
Here's an average ordinary silver dollar.

463
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500
Ta-da!

464
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.540
Very good. Very good.

465
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.120
I will show you a magic trick one day.

466
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680
What's that?

467
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.300
I am going to escape the hangman's noose.

468
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.120
How do you plan on doing that?

469
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.200
If I were to tell you.
it would not be a trick.

470
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.900
No. I'm not.

471
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.800
This is the end of the episode.

472
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.840
You see what the allies are capable of?

473
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.800
There is nothing left.

474
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.880
You said that.

475
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.060
The palace of justice.

476
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.520
The roof has been damaged by the air raids.

477
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.440
Fire gutted the upper floors
and collapsed the clock tower.

478
00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:21.980
But this court room should be able
to hold 600 people when it's finished.

479
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.400
What's with all the supplies?

480
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.160
The Nazis fought their last stand
here when the city was taken.

481
00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.880
And so they will again.

482
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.800
All the beautiful cities
in this conquered land.

483
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.060
You want to try them in
this bombed out husk?

484
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.220
This is Sir David Maxwell Fyfe.
assistant prosecutor for the British.

485
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.460
Yes. sir. we do.

486
00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:47.228
For one thing. we
can control the space.

487
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.500
For another. there's an adjoining
prison with room for up to 1200 inmates.

488
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.740
When he needs space for 22.

489
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:56.280
Sorry. 22. sir.

490
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.560
That's the number of men
we're indicting for the first trial.

491
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.260
You see. if we don't win that trial.
there won't be any more trials to come.

492
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.537
And you. myself and Justice
Jackson and our respective

493
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:11.220
governments will be the
laughingstock of the world.

494
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.080
defeated by the very men we've imprisoned.

495
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.040
So that will be fun.

496
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.060
My friends in Washington say
opinions turn to him against you.

497
00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:28.360
There's talk that you won't get the Chief
Justice's seat when Stone steps down.

498
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.720
Well. who's truly going to pick?
Benson? Benson's too political.

499
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.252
Yes. but he's there.
This whole thing's become

500
00:32:34.264 --> 00:32:36.300
a sideshow. Robert.
It hasn't even begun.

501
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:42.460
They say you're writing
all the briefs yourself.

502
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.360
refusing help from other lawyers.

503
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.840
Because it has to be done right.

504
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.720
And it will. but you can't do it alone.

505
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.860
Oh. everything will be fine
once we actually get to trial.

506
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.820
You say that. as though trying the Nazi
high command with untested case law.

507
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.100
the whole world watching
is going to be the easy part.

508
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.200
Well. when you put it like that.

509
00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:05.480
Anything less than total victory
will be considered utter defeat.

510
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.440
which means you don't just have to
win. Robert. You have to be flawless.

511
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100
No pressure.

512
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:15.840
I love him. I love him.

513
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.120
Your cells are made of
stone. nine feet by thirteen.

514
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.260
Your beds are bolted to the wall.

515
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.180
Your mattress is stuffed
with straw instead of springs.

516
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.760
Your desks are made of cardboard
and will not support a man's full weight.

517
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.036
Your chairs are never
allowed against any wall

518
00:33:36.048 --> 00:33:39.140
and will be removed
every night at sundown.

519
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.249
When you sleep. your
head and hands will

520
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:45.200
remain above your
blanket visible at all times.

521
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.747
You will be given no
belts. you will be given

522
00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:51.340
no shoelaces. you will
be given no toilet seats.

523
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.880
you will be given nothing with which to
use as a weapon to take your own lives.

524
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.240
Welcome to Nuremberg.

525
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.780
Now this is a cell.

526
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.820
Your proof?

527
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.220
SHermann built. How could I not?

528
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.740
They will charge us soon. yeah.

529
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.340
You're looking forward to it?

530
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:56.600
I believe I am.
I will have. as you say. my day in court.

531
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.700
Do you know this Jackson.
the Justice Jackson?

532
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.940
No. I do not.

533
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.040
He will try to outfit me.
but he will not succeed.

534
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.290
Very sure of yourself.

535
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.690
Doctor. no man has ever beaten me.

536
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.060
There are books filled with the
names of those who have tried.

537
00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.890
I hear you said. SHermann built.

538
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.350
You think I am at some sort of
disadvantage because I sit in a cell.

539
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.310
I will remind you. I surrendered.

540
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.700
This is exactly where I desired to be.

541
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.540
Göring remains an enigma to me.

542
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.280
The closer we get to the indictments.
the more confident he becomes.

543
00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.500
I need to figure out a
way to get closer to him.

544
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.100
So how do we do that?

545
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.020
We ask for his help.

546
00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480
With what?

547
00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.540
Rudolf Hess.

548
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.320
Rudolf Hess is coming here.

549
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.200
Rudolf Hess. deputy to the Fuhrer.

550
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.000
Third in line for succession
following Hitler and Goethe.

551
00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.951
Hess transcribed my income
for Hitler while the two were in

552
00:36:30.963 --> 00:36:34.240
prison and was known as one
of his most fanatical followers.

553
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.920
Sieg Heil!

554
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.900
Never do that in my prison again.

555
00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:51.575
On May 10th. 1941. at the
height of the war. Hess climbed into

556
00:36:51.587 --> 00:36:55.650
a Messerschmitt fighter plane
alone and flew over the North Sea.

557
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.650
He bailed out somewhere over
Scotland and broke his ankle upon impact.

558
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.490
Upon his discovery. he
announced that he was Rudolf Hess.

559
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:17.438
Hess was third in line of the German high command and
he was here on a mission of peace and wanted to speak

560
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.950
with Douglas Douglas Hamilton. the 13th Duke of Hamilton.
whom Hess had met at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.

561
00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.050
After some obstacles. Hess
was granted his meeting.

562
00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:35.356
There he announced his intention to meet with
King George VI. have Winston Churchill fired. and

563
00:37:35.368 --> 00:37:39.450
negotiate a truce with Britain allowing the two
nations to join forces and defeat the Soviet Union.

564
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.130
Hess was immediately thrown
into the Tower of London.

565
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:48.450
There Hess began claiming he had no
memory of past events. even his childhood.

566
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:55.850
This lasted until February 1945 when he
said his previous amnesia had been faked.

567
00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.773
He then flipped again
and said his amnesia had

568
00:37:59.785 --> 00:38:02.930
returned in July 1945
when Germany collapsed.

569
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:09.010
So now you would come to Hermann
Göring to discredit my old friend.

570
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.330
What would be in this for me?

571
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120
What do you want?

572
00:38:23.435 --> 00:38:26.360
My wife and my daughter.

573
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.260
No one has been able to
locate them since I surrendered.

574
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:40.120
I need you to find them for my
daughter and to give to them these letters.

575
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:50.810
First we talk to Hess and then your family.

576
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.690
How about that?

577
00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.845
So what? This guy
almost takes over the whole

578
00:38:56.857 --> 00:38:58.870
world and now he wants
to do a mail run for it?

579
00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.816
I'm a deeper with this guy
than anyone's ever been.

580
00:39:02.828 --> 00:39:05.550
And reading his family
will only tell me more.

581
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:12.810
So. Scudorf. do you remember me?

582
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.120
We were together. yes.

583
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.040
That must have been the case.

584
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.300
But I don't remember anyone.

585
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.800
It was the three of us. Scudorf.

586
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.120
You and I.

587
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.990
And Adolf.

588
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.960
We ruled an empire.

589
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:44.810
I'm sorry.

590
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.490
You may well have been a friend.

591
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.810
But I don't know you anymore.

592
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.510
He is lying.

593
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.690
He has just spent an hour to
say he does not remember me.

594
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.670
But when he arrived in the prison
and he saw me. what did he do?

595
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:18.530
Salute.

596
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:20.790
Sicile.

597
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.310
That was very good.

598
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.200
This is dumb. I'm dumb.

599
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.020
I knew you'd come through for me.

600
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.080
Yeah. because I'm a dummy.

601
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.500
How'd you find him?

602
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.680
Local gossip.
Told me they were in Baldurstein.

603
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.040
Smoke?

604
00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.820
Never seen you smoke.

605
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.080
Yeah. I don't. Gave it up.

606
00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:00.420
My parents hated this.

607
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.540
You always got them on you.

608
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.880
It's a trick to get in
good with the officers.

609
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.660
Tell myself I'll have a
smoke when the war is done.

610
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.640
The war is done. Howie.

611
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.940
It's not too much for them.

612
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.160
Mrs. Gerig.

613
00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.240
Mrs. Gerig.

614
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.160
My name is Douglas Kelly.

615
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.320
I work at the prison. I'm a psychiatrist.

616
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.160
My name is Douglas Kelly.

617
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.040
I work in the hospital. I'm a teacher.

618
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.950
Your husband asked me
to bring you some letters.

619
00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.910
Your husband asked me
to bring you some letters.

620
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:09.426
Your husband asked me
to bring you some letters.

621
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.450
Yes.

622
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:12.450
Yes.

623
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720
How is he?

624
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.920
He's good.

625
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.760
He's holding it up.

626
00:42:44.415 --> 00:42:50.240
Was that you playing?

627
00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:54.770
It was beautiful.

628
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.580
Ah. she said he's a friend of your father.

629
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960
Is he?

630
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.820
Is he your father?

631
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600
How is papa?

632
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.300
He's doing very well.

633
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.620
Is he being brave?

634
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.140
Very brave.

635
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.420
He wants to be brave too.

636
00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:33.970
He's smart.

637
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640
He's smart.

638
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.960
He has a lot of stuff to do.

639
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.080
He wrote you a letter.

640
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.380
He wrote you a letter.

641
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:49.770
Thank you.

642
00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:53.320
Do you want to go to the hospital?
Thank you.

643
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.320
She will be here 100 times. Thank you.

644
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.720
Thank you.

645
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.030
Doctor.

646
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:11.540
Dr. Hermann.

647
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.550
I don't know if I can.

648
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840
Peter.

649
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.030
Come back.

650
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920
Okay. doctor.

651
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:56.490
What the hell?

652
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.610
Hermann Göring?

653
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.670
I am a race marshal. Hermann Göring.

654
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.798
Hermann Wilhelm Göring.
you are hereby charged by

655
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.830
the United States of
America. the French Republic.

656
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.277
United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the

657
00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:40.910
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

Crimes against peace. war

659
00:45:44.387 --> 00:45:47.110
and of a common plan or
conspiracy to commit those crimes.

660
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.537
The crimes against humanity

661
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:53.150
extermination. enslavement.
deportation and other inhumane acts.

662
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.870
This is a copy of your indictment.
Do you have any questions?

663
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:58.450
No.

664
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.310
Good day.

665
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.270
Who's next?

666
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:04.910
Striker.

667
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.340
Do you have any questions?

668
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.340
What did he say?

669
00:46:24.065 --> 00:46:25.580
He said he wants a Jewish lawyer.

670
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.400
I'm not going to trial.

671
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.500
You are. Dr. Ley.

672
00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.220
I never killed anyone.

673
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.080
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

674
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:42.720
Robert.

675
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.780
Don't touch me!

676
00:46:43.781 --> 00:46:45.240
Hold him!

677
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.420
Come out!

678
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.210
Don't drive me down!

679
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.690
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

680
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.290
Rough day?

681
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:24.710
Lady from the train.

682
00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:26.850
Magic now.

683
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.130
How goes the secret mission?

684
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:32.490
It's hit a few obstacles.

685
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.850
I can see that.

686
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.110
What are you doing here?

687
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.170
I came in with the press.

688
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.470
Hermann Göring and the
Nazis are being indicted today.

689
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:46.810
No say.

690
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:49.570
Strap yourself in.

691
00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:53.590
This city is about to become
the greatest show on earth.

692
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.160
Yes. sir.

693
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.420
Dark rumors continue to swirl about
the true purpose of the Nazi work camps.

694
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.740
The legal teams are assembling for what
promises to be the trial of the century.

695
00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.000
Through this tunnel. the Nazis
will be taken to the courtroom.

696
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.320
Now being rebuilt for the trial.

697
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.994
There. the film lights
will be so bright that

698
00:49:07.006 --> 00:49:09.300
the court goers will be
provided with sunglasses.

699
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.528
Hermann Göring and his
Hitler-loving cronies are

700
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.920
scheduled to face off
with our boys in one week.

701
00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.600
Will justice prevail or
will the fascists go free?

702
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.080
This reporter desperately hopes
that the Allies run into no problems.

703
00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.380
We have a problem.

704
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:31.500
Operation Wieserbund was the German
invasion of Denmark and Norway in 1940.

705
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.888
In the textbook aggressive
war. the Nazis. they

706
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.800
rolled tanks and they
occupied neutral country.

707
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.940
Except they're going to claim that
the invasion was a preemptive strike.

708
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.860
To preempt what?

709
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.880
The British plan to invade Norway.

710
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.040
Well. that's ridiculous.

711
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.800
Absolutely ridiculous.
I'm in complete agreement.

712
00:49:49.705 --> 00:49:52.540
It concerns me that you're
in this room right now.

713
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:57.100
Well. in addition to being
ridiculous. it also happens to be true.

714
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:00.920
The idea was to use the country as
a staging area to hold the Nazis back.

715
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.565
And to prosecute the Nazis
for planning aggressive

716
00:50:04.577 --> 00:50:07.000
wars if you guys were
planning aggressive wars.

717
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.760
I bet there's a certain logic there.

718
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.180
Can the Nazis prove it?

719
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.038
The German law has
already put in a request

720
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.876
for documents. but they
don't have it. Not yet.

721
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.520
Then we're in the clear.

722
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:19.000
Maybe. But it raises a bigger issue.

723
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:24.340
We have to know what the Nazis
know. what their defense strategy is.

724
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.120
How exactly to propose we do that?

725
00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:35.200
Dr. Kelly. you are going to meet
someone very important this evening.

726
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.060
This might actually be your
chance to find the bee of some use.

727
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.040
Impressive. right?

728
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.650
Hitler was building it to be the
largest stadium on the planet.

729
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.330
You're Justice Jackson.

730
00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:58.730
And you're the shrink.

731
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.350
This is where they held the rallies.

732
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.850
Every year. Hitler would pack this
place. speak to the Nazi party as a whole.

733
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:09.290
They filmed it.

734
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.210
In 1935. this is where he
announced the Nuremberg Laws.

735
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:17.150
You know the laws?

736
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.082
The Nuremberg Laws
defined a Jew as any person

737
00:51:22.094 --> 00:51:24.530
having three or four
Jewish grandparents.

738
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:30.210
It didn't matter if you practiced
Judaism. if you converted to Christianity.

739
00:51:30.211 --> 00:51:32.210
This was about blood.

740
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.410
The laws stripped all
Jews of German citizenry.

741
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.603
They made it illegal for
Jews and Germans to marry

742
00:51:43.615 --> 00:51:46.270
each other because of
the fear of Rasenschande.

743
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.510
Defilement of the blood.

744
00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:56.430
Under the laws. Jews were
prohibited from using state hospitals.

745
00:51:56.431 --> 00:52:01.530
And not allowed access to public
education beyond the age of 14.

746
00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.390
Libraries. parks. and
beaches were closed to Jews.

747
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:11.850
War memorials had all Jewish names on them.

748
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:13.850
Expunged.

749
00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:19.890
All of that was announced
right here on this very ground.

750
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:25.590
What do you want from me?

751
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.960
Your patients?

752
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.400
I need you to start asking
them the right questions.

753
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:38.330
What are the right questions?

754
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.190
What they tell their lawyers?

755
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.810
How they plan to defend themselves?

756
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.840
You want me to be a spy?

757
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.140
I want you to do your
duty for your country.

758
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.700
No. you want me to break
Dr. Patient Confidentiality.

759
00:52:56.701 --> 00:53:00.680
I think you already have. doctor.
We read every report.

760
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.580
We need more.

761
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.600
Why not just shoot them?

762
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.820
Just whatever he wants.

763
00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.060
I mean. if you're just gonna
cheat... That's not cheating.

764
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.900
If you're asking me to betray my oath...

765
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.140
Why not just shoot
them and be done with it?

766
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.090
After the last great war.
we made Germany crawl.

767
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.350
We humiliated them.

768
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.710
Made them pay reparations
they couldn't afford.

769
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.550
We made them hate us so much
that in less than two decades...

770
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:50.510
They went from a broken
nation to near world conquerors.

771
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.350
We had to do this right
because if we don't...

772
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.350
If fifteen years from now they
come back even stronger...

773
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:02.550
I don't know if we can
beat them a third time.

774
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.640
If we just shoot these
men. we make them martyrs.

775
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.680
I'm not gonna allow them that.

776
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.940
There will be no statues of them.

777
00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.380
No songs of praise.

778
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.450
I'm gonna put Hermann
Göring on the stand...

779
00:54:22.695 --> 00:54:24.710
And I'm gonna make him
tell the world what he did.

780
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.630
So that it can never happen again.

781
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.230
You brought me here because of Göring.

782
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.350
No.

783
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.120
I brought you here to show you
that before the bullets were fired...

784
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.600
Before tens of millions of men died...

785
00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.420
All of this started with laws.

786
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.400
This war ends in a courtroom.

787
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.020
With Göring?

788
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.620
He's the face of the Nazis now.

789
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.600
As he falls. so do they all.

790
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:14.540
But if I'm gonna do that...

791
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.260
I need to be ready for it.

792
00:55:22.695 --> 00:55:23.695
Will you help me?

793
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.200
Let's talk about Hitler.

794
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.810
It is interesting you have not
asked me this directly before.

795
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.510
I'm curious what the attraction was.

796
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:56.410
There was a failed painter.

797
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:58.690
Not a very good soldier yet.

798
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:00.710
He was worshipped and revered.

799
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:05.790
He made us feel German again.

800
00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.180
How?

801
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.960
Bears of white skinned Germany craft.

802
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:23.080
And along comes a man who says...
We can reclaim our former glory.

803
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.540
Would you not follow a man like this?

804
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.420
Depends what else you wanted to do.

805
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:40.131
The first time I saw
Hitler talk was... 1922.

806
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.930
Upstairs of a coffee shop.

807
00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:44.430
For maybe 30 people.

808
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:50.830
This was peacetime. but it was a
peace without food. jobs. shoes.

809
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:53.390
And he stood up.

810
00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:58.510
And he said French bellies are
being filled with German pain.

811
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:05.130
And then... If you make
threats. you need bayonets.

812
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:08.170
Griard. Down with Versailles.

813
00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:11.650
So that night...

814
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.230
I became a National Socialist.

815
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:19.311
Off of... One speech?

816
00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:22.850
I could tell he would
appeal to the old soldiers.

817
00:57:22.851 --> 00:57:25.011
If they have the old soldiers.
they have the manpower.

818
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.450
Even with his antisemitism.
it served a practical purpose.

819
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:33.650
It brought towards us men who needed
something else to focus their emotions.

820
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:35.370
Something else to blame.

821
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.050
And the camps?

822
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:48.320
They were to be work camps
for our political opponents.

823
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.280
Nothing more.

824
00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.040
And you signed off on that?

825
00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.580
For work camps. yeah.

826
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.962
Do not think that the
Japanese entered by the

827
00:57:56.974 --> 00:58:00.100
Americans after Pearl
Harbor were not put to work?

828
00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.220
Of course they were.

829
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.440
I made the camps for the good
of Germany. for the war effort.

830
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.700
Not for death.

831
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.200
Himmler.

832
00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880
Heitrich.

833
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.520
They were responsible?

834
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:23.000
If it is true. what they say
happened at the camps.

835
00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.360
This is a grave blight on
the great German Reich.

836
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.230
Have you told your lawyer about this?

837
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.250
Douglas. I will not
stand against the Fuhrer.

838
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.370
Not even if I can help you.

839
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:47.590
These are not things
people need to know. Doctor.

840
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.050
Only you.

841
00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:55.130
He can be sympathetic.

842
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.670
It is going to be a problem for you.

843
00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:01.670
He seriously claims that he
thought they were only work camps.

844
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:02.150
That is right.

845
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:03.470
Do you believe him?

846
00:59:05.315 --> 00:59:06.590
Himmler ran the camps.

847
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:08.910
He was the head of the SS.

848
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:10.950
Göring was the head of the Air Force.

849
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.174
How often in America does
the head of the Air Force

850
00:59:13.186 --> 00:59:15.330
know what the head of
the Secret Service is doing?

851
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:18.666
I am sorry. but I cannot believe that we
are having this conversation right now.

852
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:19.530
I am doing what you ask.

853
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.790
No. you are apologizing for him.

854
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.806
Gentlemen. please.
I am not the one defending the Nazi.

855
00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:27.490
You think I am defending him?
I am analyzing him. you provincial moron.

856
00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:32.530
Göring is. above all things. a narcissist.

857
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:37.030
The only thing he cares about is building
Germany up and then becoming her leader.

858
00:59:37.325 --> 00:59:39.110
He does not care about the Jews.

859
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:40.450
So he is fine with them dying.

860
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.706
And he is fine with them not.

861
00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:45.270
The only thing Hermann Göring
cares about is Hermann Göring.

862
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:47.917
Does that sound like
a man who dedicates

863
00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:50.630
himself to the extermination
of an entire race?

864
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.878
Well. Dr. Kelly. I really
appreciate your thoughtfulness

865
00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:01.190
on this. but I have to admit
it is very hard to believe.

866
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.490
You want to walk into that courtroom
with a handful of assumptions?

867
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:08.830
Fine.

868
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.610
But he will eat you for breakfast.

869
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:29.390
I would like to apologize for my
outbursts earlier. It felt much better.

870
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.120
I felt a chance to be shifting.

871
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.920
And you?
Something seems to be troubling you.

872
01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.180
I am fine.

873
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.960
I am fine.

874
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680
I am fine.

875
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:49.880
I am fine.

876
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:50.160
I am fine.

877
01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.460
I am fine.

878
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.160
This will all be over soon.

879
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.840
Blaze mode is markedly improved.

880
01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.340
He told us he has begun making
arrangements for his defense.

881
01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.620
I feel as though for the first
time he has reached out to me.

882
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.610
He ripped out the hem of
his towel to make a rope.

883
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:45.770
He stuffed his underwear into his
mouth so he wouldn't scream and then...

884
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.330
just leaned forward. apparently
with a great deal of determination.

885
01:01:52.235 --> 01:01:53.595
You didn't see any of this coming?

886
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.130
He told me he was doing better.

887
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:58.410
Told you.

888
01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:02.310
I'm supposed to keep them alive.

889
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.730
I'm bringing in another doctor.

890
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:18.610
A firm and a second opinion is
required for some of your patients.

891
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:24.370
Dr. Gilbert arrives this afternoon.
You will brief him.

892
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.440
How do you feel about suicide?

893
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.210
The last refuge of cowards. yeah.

894
01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:45.370
And the last act of a desperate man?

895
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.390
So all his exceptions. of course.

896
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:56.220
You are in trouble.

897
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.200
Why would you say that?

898
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:04.540
A new doctor. new tests.
Since Lai died. they no longer trust you.

899
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.340
Your own?

900
01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.940
Douglas. when you are
in a position of power.

901
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.220
they will always come after you.

902
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:20.580
You have to protect yourself.

903
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.760
Why would I have to
protect myself from my allies?

904
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.660
Just because a man is your ally

905
01:03:27.635 --> 01:03:29.840
does not mean he is on your side.

906
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.500
My father was a
diplomat. did I tell you this?

907
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.200
Yeah.

908
01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:43.820
He was posted to Africa.

909
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:48.760
And it was there he was
to meet his best friend.

910
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.600
a man named Hermann von Epstein.

911
01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.740
I was named after him.

912
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400
Yeah.

913
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:03.720
I was named for a Jew.

914
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:11.340
We loved Uncle Hermann
so much. he was very rich.

915
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:14.880
He lived in Frozenstein Castle.

916
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:18.900
And when I was six years old.

917
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.920
he moved my entire family in with him.

918
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160
Can you imagine?

919
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.960
It was a child's dream
to live in such a castle.

920
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.700
I would run down the halls.
pretending I was a knight.

921
01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.720
I would stare down from the battlements.
envisioning armies forming to attack.

922
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:48.340
Uncle Hermann. he lived in the largest
and most beautiful room on the top floor.

923
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:52.560
Down the hall. my mother
had a bedroom. also beautiful.

924
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840
My father.

925
01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.980
he lived in a small
bedroom on the ground floor.

926
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:08.160
And I was to realize just
how rich Uncle Hermann was.

927
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.160
So rich that he could move my family in.

928
01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:17.020
So rich that he could put
my father on the ground floor.

929
01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.560
So rich that whenever he wanted.

930
01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.000
he could walk down the hall

931
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:29.780
and enjoy my mother.

932
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.790
Just because a man is your ally

933
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:38.750
does not mean he is on your side.

934
01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.630
You found Hermann going to be imaginative?

935
01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:53.270
I didn't find him to be that way.
The test did.

936
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.270
Well. that is what a second opinion is for.

937
01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.710
Which brings us to Rudolph Hess.

938
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:07.150
I'm inclined to believe
that his amnesia is genuine.

939
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.590
You mean the part where
he forgets about being a Nazi?

940
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:11.346
Okay. look. Dr.

941
01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:15.550
Kelly. I'm not here to
step on your toes. okay?

942
01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.830
I'll share research with a co-author.

943
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:21.290
Co-author of what?

944
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:24.690
You don't have to play coy with me.
We're both here for the same reason.

945
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:29.951
Now. two books about the Nazi high command
that's going to cut into the market.

946
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:32.590
I say we write it together.

947
01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:39.990
Good luck with your tests.

948
01:06:58.030 --> 01:06:59.050
She was in.

949
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:01.410
Thank you.

950
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.630
Come and see Peter Haines.

951
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.180
Oh. she was. uh. astounded.

952
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:13.820
Teach me this trick.

953
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640
Is it a coin by the ear?

954
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.540
Yeah. yeah. Teach me this
trick so I. too. can astound her.

955
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.340
I gave my silver dollar to your daughter.

956
01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:27.180
It's the simplest trick in the world.

957
01:08:27.181 --> 01:08:29.720
And it works because. you
know. people want to believe.

958
01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:33.320
Well. you hold up the dollar and you say.

959
01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.560
Hey. folks. here is an
ordinary average silver dollar.

960
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.180
And you put it in your other hand.

961
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:44.760
You focus on it.

962
01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.480
But really. it's right here.

963
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:52.500
You palm it in your right hand.

964
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960
Palm it?

965
01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:56.480
You put it between these two fingers.

966
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:58.880
You wrap your palm around it.

967
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.460
But you focus on your left hand.

968
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.900
And you feel the coin
in there. the weight of it.

969
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.220
And if you believe it.

970
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:10.520
then they'll believe it.

971
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.860
And then you just. uh.

972
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.620
well. you reach behind the ear.

973
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.840
Abracadabra!

974
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:24.500
What is abracadabra?

975
01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.880
Uh. it's a magic word.

976
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.940
It gives the illusion of a cosmic weight.

977
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.360
And it always must be abracadabra.

978
01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.020
No. it can be anything.

979
01:09:37.285 --> 01:09:38.700
It can be presto.

980
01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:42.200
I think I prefer abracadabra.

981
01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:45.000
So it was your father
who taught you this trick?

982
01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.240
My father?

983
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
No.

984
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.520
You say that like it is unthinkable.

985
01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.600
And my father was content to

986
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:58.420
buy his trade and display
a cheerful disposition.

987
01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:02.600
He was a man of no accomplishment.

988
01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640
But you believe

989
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:08.180
you are destined for more.

990
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.240
You want to be known as a great man.

991
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:19.210
Yes.

992
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.130
And I am your ticket.

993
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.680
You will return to America as
the great scholar of the Nazis.

994
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.380
And I will have a trick
to impress my daughter

995
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:36.160
when this trial is done.

996
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:44.210
Stop taking me with you to see him.

997
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:49.730
I didn't want to bother you so late.

998
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.250
I've been seeing him a lot without me.

999
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:55.310
What are you doing. doc?

1000
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.310
Trying to learn something?

1001
01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:01.770
Are you sure that's
what this is still about?

1002
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.090
Good night. Howie.

1003
01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.290
Are you going to defend yourself. Hermann?

1004
01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.710
Oh. but not too late now.

1005
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:22.750
I'm serious.

1006
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240
Have you friends. doctor?

1007
01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:34.340
I think that word is a little
too simple for what we are.

1008
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:41.080
But are you asking
me this as a friend?

1009
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:45.370
I am.

1010
01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:54.470
Tomorrow. when I enter my plea.

1011
01:11:56.505 --> 01:11:57.730
I will read a statement.

1012
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:59.910
I am going to say

1013
01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.610
that I assume all
responsibility for my actions.

1014
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:06.350
I will refuse. however.

1015
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:10.450
to accept responsibility
for acts committed by others

1016
01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:12.430
that I was unaware of

1017
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:15.430
and I would not have approved of.

1018
01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.180
But I did.

1019
01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:24.500
I did for my country.

1020
01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.300
Tell me you have not
done the same for yours.

1021
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:48.310
They told me I could find you here.

1022
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.620
In seven hours.

1023
01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.460
the whole world is going
to be focused on this room.

1024
01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520
This is it.

1025
01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:05.820
This is everything.

1026
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:16.130
This is the statement that
Gerhard plans on reading tomorrow.

1027
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.380
Thank you.

1028
01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:49.330
May it please your honors.

1029
01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:54.290
the privilege

1030
01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.510
of opening the first trial in history

1031
01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:00.810
for crimes against the peace of the world

1032
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:03.050
imposes a grave responsibility.

1033
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.950
The wrongs which we
seek to condemn and punish

1034
01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.590
have been so calculated.

1035
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:15.150
so malignant and so devastating

1036
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:20.190
that civilization cannot
tolerate their being ignored

1037
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:24.570
because we cannot
survive their being repeated.

1038
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.400
In the prisoner's dock

1039
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:32.400
said 20-odd broken men.

1040
01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.700
we will show them

1041
01:17:35.435 --> 01:17:39.520
to be living symbols of racial hatreds.

1042
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.720
of terrorism and violence.

1043
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.900
and of the arrogance

1044
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:49.700
and cruelty of power.

1045
01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:58.290
Civilization can afford nothing

1046
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.190
with the men in whom these forces

1047
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.600
now precariously survive.

1048
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:11.080
Wars are no longer local.

1049
01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:14.840
All modern wars

1050
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.760
become world wars. eventually.

1051
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.840
And none of the big nations can stay out.

1052
01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.080
But the ultimate step

1053
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.340
in avoiding periodic wars

1054
01:18:30.615 --> 01:18:33.060
in a system of international lawlessness

1055
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.740
is to make statesmen
responsible for the law.

1056
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:42.720
And let me make clear

1057
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:46.440
that while this law is first applied
against German aggressors.

1058
01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.500
it must condemn aggression
by any other nation.

1059
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.381
including those who sit
here now in judgment.

1060
01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:55.920
We are able to do away

1061
01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:58.140
with domestic tyranny

1062
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:00.060
and violence and aggression

1063
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:03.380
by those in power against
the rights of their own people

1064
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:07.360
only when we make all men

1065
01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.080
insurable to the law.

1066
01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:26.210
Hermann Kering.

1067
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:30.130
the defendants are to plead guilty

1068
01:19:30.605 --> 01:19:31.605
or not guilty

1069
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:33.110
to the charges against them.

1070
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:35.390
They will proceed in turn

1071
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.840
to a point in the dock

1072
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:38.450
opposite to the microphone.

1073
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.690
I am Hermann Wilhelm Kering.

1074
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:57.550
I stand before the
court today and the world

1075
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.950
and pledge only to tell...

1076
01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.070
The tribunal has reached the decision

1077
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.150
that the defendants are not
entitled to make a statement.

1078
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:10.071
They will be permitted
to address the court

1079
01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:11.630
prior to their sentencing.

1080
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.050
As Reichsmarschall of Germany.

1081
01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:17.730
You are not Reichsmarschall here.

1082
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.990
You are only Hermann
Kering. the prisoner.

1083
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.090
Do you plead
guilty or not guilty?

1084
01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.240
Yes. Schutig.

1085
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:01.630
Emmy!

1086
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.990
Eva!

1087
01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:06.230
Emmy!

1088
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:08.710
What happened?

1089
01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:10.570
What happened? Where are they?

1090
01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:13.490
What? Where are they?

1091
01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:14.690
They took them.

1092
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:15.750
Who?

1093
01:21:16.150 --> 01:21:17.150
Americans.

1094
01:21:55.330 --> 01:21:56.510
You've got to be shitting me.

1095
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:59.010
Thanks. I'm going to need it.

1096
01:22:01.085 --> 01:22:02.690
They arrested Emmy Gering

1097
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:05.770
on suspicion of complicity
with her husband's art thefts.

1098
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:07.210
The kid goes to the nuns.

1099
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:08.490
No contact allowed.

1100
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.070
They're women and children.

1101
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:12.430
Yeah.

1102
01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.850
Sir. we're supposed to be better than this.

1103
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:16.290
It's out of my hands.

1104
01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:18.690
And you're welcome.

1105
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:23.410
By the way.

1106
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.960
how did you know where she was hiding?

1107
01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:39.270
Did Etta play for you again?

1108
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.250
She did.

1109
01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.010
She's very talented.

1110
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.230
She likes you.

1111
01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.780
Do you have the letters?

1112
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:54.850
No.

1113
01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.910
No letters. unfortunately.

1114
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:59.750
No?

1115
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.010
Next time.

1116
01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.310
Here's the menu. Doctor.

1117
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:11.070
You're just talking about my family.

1118
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:12.290
Ah. yes.

1119
01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.470
That's fine. I'm sorry to hear about that.

1120
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:17.510
That's fine.

1121
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:18.810
Their arrest?

1122
01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:21.730
Your wife and daughter
were arrested five days ago.

1123
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:24.390
He didn't tell you?

1124
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:31.390
Hey. Hey.

1125
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:32.750
What the hell was that?

1126
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:35.950
That was me being honest with my patients.

1127
01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:37.506
Something you ought to try sometime.

1128
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:38.850
You destroyed him in there.

1129
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:40.030
So?

1130
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:47.550
Hey! Hey!

1131
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:50.870
Jesus Christ.

1132
01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:52.810
You're mental health professionals!

1133
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:54.430
For Christ's sake!

1134
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:01.840
Doctor Gilbert. would you like me
to place Doctor Kelly under arrest?

1135
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:06.820
No. sir.

1136
01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.480
Then get out of my goddamn office!

1137
01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.960
All rise!

1138
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:37.000
May it please the court.

1139
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.400
the prosecution would now like to enter
into evidence the following film footage.

1140
01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:46.420
The images you are about to see
have never before been shown in public.

1141
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.660
This film should offer a brief explanation

1142
01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.140
of what the words
concentration camp implied.

1143
01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:14.460
These are the locations of the
largest concentration and prison camps

1144
01:25:14.685 --> 01:25:18.440
maintained throughout Germany and
occupied Europe under the Nazi regime.

1145
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.758
The 4th Armored Division
of General Patton's

1146
01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.660
3rd Army liberated
this camp early in April.

1147
01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.996
They see the woodshed
where lime-covered bodies are

1148
01:25:32.008 --> 01:25:34.840
stacked in layers and the
stench is overpowering.

1149
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:48.870
Slave labor camp at Nordhausen liberated
by the 3rd Armored Division. 1st Army.

1150
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:52.738
At least 3.000 political prisoners
died here at the brutal hands of

1151
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:56.110
SS troops and pardon German
criminals who were the camp's daughter.

1152
01:25:57.210 --> 01:26:01.110
Nordhausen has been a depository
for slaves found unfit for work in

1153
01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:05.210
the underground B-bomb plants and
in other German camps and factories.

1154
01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:12.980
Amid the corpses are human
skeletons too weak to move.

1155
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:20.494
None of our medical
battalions work two days and

1156
01:26:20.506 --> 01:26:22.790
nights binding wounds
and giving medications.

1157
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:27.770
But for advanced cases of starvation
and tuberculosis there are often no cures.

1158
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:32.530
Survivors are shown being evacuated
for treatment in Allied hospitals.

1159
01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:50.310
I'm Lieutenant Senior Grade Jack H. Taylor.
U.S. Navy. from Hollywood. California.

1160
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:53.490
Believe it or not. this is the first
time I've ever been in the movies.

1161
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:55.930
I was captured December 1st.

1162
01:26:56.835 --> 01:27:01.970
I was taken to this Mauthausen
concentration locker. an extermination camp.

1163
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:14.430
where we have been starving and beaten
and killed. forcibly my turn hadn't come.

1164
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:22.513
There were five or
six ways by cast. by

1165
01:27:22.525 --> 01:27:26.980
shooting. by beating.
against beating with clubs.

1166
01:27:31.665 --> 01:27:35.561
by exposure. that is. standing
out in the snow naked for 48 hours

1167
01:27:35.573 --> 01:27:39.240
and having cold water thrown
on them in the middle of winter.

1168
01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:46.180
starvation. dogs. and
pushing over a 100-foot cliff.

1169
01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.540
This is all true. has been
seen. and is now being reported.

1170
01:27:57.470 --> 01:28:01.070
Nationalities and prison numbers are
tattooed on the stomachs of the inmates.

1171
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:14.210
In the official report. the Buchenwald
camp is termed an extermination factory.

1172
01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:19.350
Bodies stacked one upon the other
were found outside the crematory.

1173
01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:28.253
The body disposal plant. Inside are
the ovens which gave the crematorium

1174
01:28:28.265 --> 01:28:32.030
a maximum disposal capacity of
about 400 bodies per 10-hour day.

1175
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:40.120
A car near München. one of the
oldest of the Nazi prison camp.

1176
01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:00.240
This is what the liberators
found inside the building.

1177
01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.318
Hanging an orderly road
were the clothes of prisoners

1178
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.730
who had been suffocated
in a lethal gas chamber.

1179
01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:36.778
They had been persuaded to
remove their clothing under the pretext

1180
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:40.170
of taking a shower for which
towels and soap were provided.

1181
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:49.432
Planetary conditions were so
appalling that heavy equipment

1182
01:29:49.444 --> 01:29:52.440
had to be brought in to
speed the work of cleaning up.

1183
01:30:14.295 --> 01:30:16.820
This was Bergen-Belsen.

1184
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:56.750
Righted so.

1185
01:31:02.695 --> 01:31:03.695
How is it possible?

1186
01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.520
Himmler.

1187
01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.800
Himmler wasn't second in command.

1188
01:31:11.865 --> 01:31:14.520
You were 1200 camps?

1189
01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.800
What am I supposed to
believe that he didn't know?

1190
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.460
Anyone can fake an atrocity.

1191
01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.200
So you're saying the film was a fake?
That's your defense?

1192
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.456
What would you have me say?

1193
01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.120
How about the truth for once?

1194
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:28.420
So you can run and tell Jackson?

1195
01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.580
My friend. your hypocrisy is stunning.

1196
01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:36.620
My hypocrisy?

1197
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.980
You think American bullets
and bombs don't kill people?

1198
01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.645
You vaporize 150.000
Japanese at the touch of a button

1199
01:31:43.657 --> 01:31:47.800
and you presume to stand in
judgment on me for all crimes?

1200
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.276
We had every right to defend ourselves.

1201
01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.540
How do you defend yourself
on someone else's soil?

1202
01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.903
There's a difference
between us bombing war

1203
01:31:53.915 --> 01:31:56.560
factories and civilians
dying as collateral damage

1204
01:31:56.710 --> 01:32:03.120
and you building 1200 human slaughterhouses
designed to exterminate an entire race.

1205
01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.300
And you know it!

1206
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.180
What do you think war is?

1207
01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.010
Not what I thought today.

1208
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:15.170
What do you think the Russians
do to German prisoners of war?

1209
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:20.230
You have your freedom and I am a
prisoner because you've earned and we lost.

1210
01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:22.190
Not because you are morally superior!

1211
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:26.570
This trial will be a farce in 15 years.

1212
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:29.710
Great conquerors and not
thought of as murderers.

1213
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:34.350
Genghis Khan. Alexander the
Great... You're not Alexander the Great!

1214
01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.030
You are a fat man in a cell.

1215
01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:48.940
And you know I have made a mistake.

1216
01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:55.160
You are not destined for more.

1217
01:32:56.630 --> 01:33:00.200
You will have an unhappy life. I think.

1218
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.140
It will all be overshadowed by this.

1219
01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.880
By the time spent with me.

1220
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.320
You will write your
volumes trying to relive it.

1221
01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.700
The one moment in your life.

1222
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.120
When you actually stood with greatness.

1223
01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.340
You think you're a great man?

1224
01:33:23.850 --> 01:33:25.010
You think that's your legacy?

1225
01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.940
At least I will have one.

1226
01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.680
You will leave no mark on this world.

1227
01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:32.900
I am the book!

1228
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.780
You are merely a footnote.

1229
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:42.790
They're gonna kill you.

1230
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:49.250
They're gonna hang you by
the neck until you piss yourself.

1231
01:33:49.251 --> 01:33:51.590
And die.

1232
01:33:54.585 --> 01:33:55.625
Your wife will be a widow.

1233
01:33:57.455 --> 01:33:58.910
Your daughter will be an orphan.

1234
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:04.510
And you will have done that to yourself.

1235
01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.100
I know who you are.

1236
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.420
What do you like?

1237
01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.500
You don't wanna know.

1238
01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:45.580
Jackson's putting him on
the stand day after tomorrow?

1239
01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.340
Jackson's gonna get killed.

1240
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.420
Why do you say that?

1241
01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:56.820
Because Gary is ready for him.

1242
01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.960
He was ready for all of us.

1243
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:09.290
Why don't you tell me all about it?

1244
01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.720
Look at that!

1245
01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:16.990
Your private conversations with
Hermann Göring made the front page.

1246
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:18.570
You're finished.

1247
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:21.610
I signed your transfer order this morning.

1248
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:24.570
You're to be sent back to the
states where you'll be discharged.

1249
01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:28.550
You have embarrassed me
and this office for the last time.

1250
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:31.470
I'm sorry. Colonel.

1251
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920
You deserve better.

1252
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:36.070
Yes. I did.

1253
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.370
And just so you know. we are
releasing Göring's wife and daughter.

1254
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.130
You were right. We are better than that.

1255
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:50.870
Thank you. sir.

1256
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:52.230
Your train's at five o'clock.

1257
01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:56.250
Don't take this the wrong way.
but I never wanna see you again.

1258
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.160
Care to say goodbye?

1259
01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:14.380
Did you really mean it?

1260
01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:15.780
You said Jackson had no chance?

1261
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:19.300
Sure. It's all just a big show
for the cameras anyway.

1262
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.820
So it doesn't matter what happens tomorrow.

1263
01:36:22.525 --> 01:36:24.220
If Göring beats Jackson. so be it.

1264
01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.460
Yeah. I don't believe that.

1265
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:28.900
Neither do you.

1266
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:32.740
You know more about
him than anybody on Earth.

1267
01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:35.360
Yeah. that's right. I do.

1268
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:38.790
You know. I spent
thousands of hours with him.

1269
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:40.560
I run hundreds of tests.

1270
01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.360
You know what sets him apart from us?

1271
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:44.820
Nothing.

1272
01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.260
I know.

1273
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.460
You know?

1274
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:52.920
Because I'm one of them.

1275
01:36:55.055 --> 01:36:56.135
What are you talking about?

1276
01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.920
I'm German. Doc.

1277
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.840
I grew up in Munich.

1278
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.820
You grew up in Detroit.
You said your mom spoke German.

1279
01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:06.980
She did.

1280
01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.120
But my father.

1281
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.100
Because I was raised here.

1282
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.060
You're an American soldier.

1283
01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:17.230
Why'd you leave?

1284
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:20.850
Why do you think?

1285
01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040
You're a Jew.

1286
01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:38.670
You know. with the blonde
hair and the blue eyes.

1287
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:40.030
I never got a hassle much.

1288
01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:44.590
My father was a patriot.

1289
01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:47.130
He fought for Germany
in the First World War.

1290
01:37:50.105 --> 01:37:51.260
We loved this country.

1291
01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.600
Eventually he realized we had to get out.

1292
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:00.190
How'd you do?

1293
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.810
The problem was getting travel visas.

1294
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:07.910
Other countries wouldn't take us.

1295
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:12.230
My dad had a cousin in New York who helped.

1296
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:16.030
We finally got our visa in 1940.

1297
01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.950
But we only had enough
money for one ticket out.

1298
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:25.660
My little sister. Margo...

1299
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.660
She was only 11. so...

1300
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.620
My parents didn't want her traveling alone.

1301
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.380
Until they sent me.

1302
01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.060
Boy. how seasick the whole way.

1303
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:47.730
When I landed. I stayed with my cousin.

1304
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:52.390
When the Nazis invaded Holland.

1305
01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:58.610
my family never showed up.

1306
01:39:02.855 --> 01:39:04.080
That's when I went to Detroit.

1307
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.160
I got a job as an
apprentice in a tool factory

1308
01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.480
when the English listened
to baseball on the radio.

1309
01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.240
When Pearl Harbor happened.

1310
01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.340
I was the first one

1311
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:21.440
in the recruitment office to enlist.

1312
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:25.290
You know what they said?

1313
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:28.320
They couldn't take me.

1314
01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:30.660
Because I wasn't an American citizen.

1315
01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.780
I'd have to wait to get drafted.

1316
01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:38.670
So I did.

1317
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:42.010
I waited. and I waited.

1318
01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.710
I checked the mailbox
every day for two years.

1319
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:50.690
June 6th. 1944.

1320
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:55.350
Landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day.

1321
01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.030
Four years earlier.

1322
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:05.990
I left this country.

1323
01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:10.130
scared and alone in
the middle of the night.

1324
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:16.250
But I came back with a goddamn army.

1325
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.880
I found Margo.

1326
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.320
She's in Switzerland.

1327
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:27.750
She's 16 now.

1328
01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.060
She's living with relatives.

1329
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.040
She's good.

1330
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:35.680
She made it.

1331
01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.120
And her folks.

1332
01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.140
The records show that

1333
01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:47.460
my parents arrived at
Auschwitz August 12th. 1942.

1334
01:40:51.010 --> 01:40:54.160
The camp was liberated January 27th. 1945.

1335
01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.770
No sign of them.

1336
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.840
The Nazis had a name
for what they did to us.

1337
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:10.950
The Final Solution.

1338
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:17.790
Like we were

1339
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.970
some kind of nagging puzzle

1340
01:41:22.890 --> 01:41:25.110
that they finally figured out how to solve.

1341
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:30.850
So sorry. Howie.

1342
01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.730
I don't want to tell Stryker.

1343
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.500
I want to tell him

1344
01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:43.100
right before they put
that rope around his neck.

1345
01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.060
I'm going to tell that piece of
shit that he was confining in a Jew.

1346
01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:52.680
You say it doesn't matter

1347
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:55.070
what happens tomorrow.

1348
01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:01.660
It matters.

1349
01:42:04.635 --> 01:42:05.635
More you know

1350
01:42:08.135 --> 01:42:09.420
matters to me.

1351
01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:12.650
to my family.

1352
01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:14.890
to all of Germany.

1353
01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.020
Göring has to fall.

1354
01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.100
You think he's going to beat Jackson?

1355
01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.780
Don. please.

1356
01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.340
Do something about it.

1357
01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.660
I can't.

1358
01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:43.100
You can't what?

1359
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:47.310
I'm just a shrink.

1360
01:43:05.335 --> 01:43:07.710
You want to know why it happened here?

1361
01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:11.660
People let it happen.

1362
01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:15.880
Because they didn't stand
up until it was too late.

1363
01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:20.750
Have a safe trip home. Doc.

1364
01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:35.750
Yes. sir. Of course.

1365
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.370
No. I... I completely
understand.

1366
01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:44.570
Thank you.

1367
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:49.470
Son of a gun.

1368
01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:54.990
Truman's just named Frederick Vinson
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

1369
01:43:57.900 --> 01:43:59.630
Yeah. I didn't want the job anyway.

1370
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:01.070
Who would?

1371
01:44:02.850 --> 01:44:03.850
Welcome's up.

1372
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:08.190
You're walking into a trap.

1373
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:11.251
Dr. Kelly. I was under the
impression you'd been relieved.

1374
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:13.710
Putting Göring on the stand
gives him everything he wants.

1375
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:15.590
It's why he surrendered in the first place.

1376
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:18.711
His last chance to redeem
the Reich on the world stage.

1377
01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:20.426
After what I read in
the paper this morning.

1378
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:22.130
I don't believe I care
what you think anymore.

1379
01:44:22.150 --> 01:44:23.010
You can't beat him.

1380
01:44:23.011 --> 01:44:23.550
Charles!

1381
01:44:24.010 --> 01:44:25.010
Not without help.

1382
01:44:26.250 --> 01:44:28.030
This is everything I have on him.

1383
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:30.790
Private files. off-the-book conversations.

1384
01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:33.351
I know more about this man
than anyone else on the planet.

1385
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:34.750
And it's all in here.

1386
01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:39.670
Why do you have this?

1387
01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.700
I was gonna write a book.

1388
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:46.560
Make something of myself.

1389
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:51.780
It's okay.

1390
01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.220
So you really think I can't beat him?

1391
01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.120
Honestly?

1392
01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:00.220
I don't know.

1393
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:03.380
You know. I was gonna be Chief Justice.

1394
01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.360
I'll be lucky if there's a place
on the court for me when I return.

1395
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.420
As of six hours ago. I was
discharged from the army.

1396
01:45:12.765 --> 01:45:14.460
There's nothing left for us to do. sir.

1397
01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:18.800
Might as well go finish the war.

1398
01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.940
The trick is to use his vanity against him.

1399
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.720
He is the Reich Marshall.

1400
01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.100
And the Reich Marshall is never wrong.

1401
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.100
You can't beat him.

1402
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.640
Every decision that's led him to this place

1403
01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.620
has to be the right one.

1404
01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.680
So as much as he
won't want to talk about

1405
01:45:46.681 --> 01:45:50.100
the camps and the SS
and the final solution.

1406
01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.720
you can make him own them.

1407
01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:54.960
Kelly's right.

1408
01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.480
Get him to admit to signing those orders.

1409
01:45:58.500 --> 01:45:59.500
And you'll have him.

1410
01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.400
I'll have him.

1411
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:06.810
This is your day.

1412
01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:09.150
You're ready.

1413
01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:24.370
No idea. sir.

1414
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:45.310
Justice Jackson. are you ready?

1415
01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:06.030
The prosecution now calls
Hermann Göring to the stand.

1416
01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:58.160
For the record. is there
any doubt in your mind

1417
01:48:58.410 --> 01:48:59.820
that Adolf Hitler is dead?

1418
01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:05.050
I have no doubt.

1419
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:07.930
So you are aware

1420
01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:12.170
that this makes you the only
living man who can expound to us

1421
01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.410
the true purposes of the Nazi party

1422
01:49:14.785 --> 01:49:16.610
and the inner workings of its leadership?

1423
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:20.550
I am perfectly aware of this. sir.

1424
01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:26.990
Your party from the very beginning
intended to overthrow the Weimar Republic.

1425
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:31.650
That was our firm intention.

1426
01:49:33.370 --> 01:49:34.370
What the hell?

1427
01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:35.850
And upon coming to power.

1428
01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:38.990
you immediately abolished
parliamentary government in Germany.

1429
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:41.230
We found it to be no longer necessary.

1430
01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:45.890
Is that because you believe people
are not capable of self-government?

1431
01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:50.690
We were elected by the people

1432
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:53.570
and given a mandate for change.

1433
01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:58.970
The systems that had previously existed
had brought Germany to the verge of ruin.

1434
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:01.790
The old president of Roosevelt said

1435
01:50:02.190 --> 01:50:03.990
there are certain peoples in Europe

1436
01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:05.750
who have forsaken democracy

1437
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:09.330
not because they did not wish for it.

1438
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:13.930
but because democracy had
brought forth men who were too weak.

1439
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:19.060
After you came to power.

1440
01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:23.940
you regarded it necessary to
suppress all opposition parties. correct?

1441
01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:28.580
We found it necessary to no
longer permit opposition here.

1442
01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:33.500
And you also considered it immediately
necessary to establish concentration camps?

1443
01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:40.520
The camps were set up as a measure
against the communists and their violence.

1444
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.060
So it was necessary to
erect a camp for them.

1445
01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.040
run two or three camps.
something like this.

1446
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:50.100
You also had to have certain groups

1447
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.520
to carry out orders and fight
for you if necessary. right?

1448
01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:57.920
Certain groups... Well. for example.
if you wanted certain people killed.

1449
01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.660
you had to have some
organization that would kill them.

1450
01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:04.875
Yeah. Germany had
this level of political

1451
01:51:04.876 --> 01:51:06.821
police that you would
find in any other country.

1452
01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:10.760
And the SA and the SS were the
organizations that carried out these orders

1453
01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:14.320
and dealt with people on a
physical level. were they not?

1454
01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.740
The SA never received
orders to kill anybody.

1455
01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:20.020
Neither did the SS. not in my time.

1456
01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:22.800
Beyond a certain point.
I had no influence on it.

1457
01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.160
The SS carried out arrests.

1458
01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.440
They handled the transportation of
people to the concentration camps.

1459
01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.800
Can you not recall a time

1460
01:51:32.690 --> 01:51:34.540
when the SS began to perform the function

1461
01:51:34.541 --> 01:51:37.100
of acting as the executor
of the Nazi party?

1462
01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:39.480
It would be very
difficult for me to explain

1463
01:51:39.481 --> 01:51:44.120
to an outsider whether the SS or whether
the Gestapo may or may not be active.

1464
01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:46.420
Try.

1465
01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.540
Perhaps as the police came more and more

1466
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:51.990
into the hands of Himmler.

1467
01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:54.290
expectations may have changed.

1468
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:57.425
And. of course. it is well
known that some SS units were

1469
01:51:57.426 --> 01:52:01.950
guarding the camps and later
performed some police functions.

1470
01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:07.330
And carried out other
functions in the camps?

1471
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:10.150
To what functions do you refer?

1472
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.150
They carried out all of the
functions of the camps. didn't they?

1473
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.910
If an SS unit was guarding a camp.

1474
01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.330
and an SS leader was the camp commandant.

1475
01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:34.150
send it to the rational to assume

1476
01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:40.230
that they would have carried
out all of the functions of the camp.

1477
01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:46.730
You have said that you wanted a
strong German state to overcome

1478
01:52:46.731 --> 01:52:48.870
the conditions of
Versailles. is that correct?

1479
01:52:49.050 --> 01:52:52.710
We wanted a strong German
state. regardless of Versailles.

1480
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:55.050
The first country to be absorbed by Germany

1481
01:52:55.051 --> 01:52:58.990
was Austria. but it had not been part
of Germany before the First World War.

1482
01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:03.171
and it had not been taken from Germany by
the Treaty of Versailles. is that correct?

1483
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:05.050
That is not entirely correct.

1484
01:53:05.190 --> 01:53:10.350
The second territory taken by Germany was
Bohemia. then Moravia. and then Slovakia.

1485
01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.490
These were not taken from
Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.

1486
01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.790
nor had they been part of Germany

1487
01:53:18.065 --> 01:53:19.770
before the First World War. had they?

1488
01:53:19.771 --> 01:53:21.550
These parts of Czech territory

1489
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:27.270
were not part of the smaller German Reich
at the time of the Treaty of Versailles.

1490
01:53:28.110 --> 01:53:35.370
However. formally. they were united to
the German Reich for hundreds of years.

1491
01:53:35.371 --> 01:53:38.010
You still have not answered my question.

1492
01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.610
I have answered your question.

1493
01:53:39.775 --> 01:53:41.490
If the facts do not suit you.

1494
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:43.130
there is very little I can do.

1495
01:53:43.150 --> 01:53:44.410
Can you not answer yes or no?

1496
01:53:45.130 --> 01:53:49.250
Time may not mean quite as much
to you as it does to the rest of us.

1497
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:52.050
Mr. Justice. the tribunal
thinks the witness ought to

1498
01:53:52.051 --> 01:53:56.930
be allowed to make what
explanations he thinks right.

1499
01:53:57.270 --> 01:54:00.310
I trust that the court is not unaware
that outside of this courtroom

1500
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:04.210
is a great social question
regarding the revival of Nazism.

1501
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:08.190
and that one of the purposes
of declaring is to encourage

1502
01:54:08.191 --> 01:54:12.550
and perpetuate it by propaganda
from this trial now in process.

1503
01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:17.550
This witness has adopted in the
witness box and the prisoner's dock

1504
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:22.790
an arrogant and contemptuous attitude
towards this tribunal. which is giving him

1505
01:54:23.165 --> 01:54:25.050
the opportunity of a trial.

1506
01:54:25.615 --> 01:54:27.090
which he never gave a living soul.

1507
01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:29.730
The ruling stands. Mr. Justice.

1508
01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:39.260
I must of course bow to
the ruling of the tribunal

1509
01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:45.040
and would simply request that the witness
find a way to keep his answers succinct.

1510
01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.260
Could you please repeat the question?

1511
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:56.960
They were not taken from you

1512
01:54:57.460 --> 01:54:59.000
by the Treaty of Versailles.

1513
01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.040
where of course Austria was
taken by the Versailles Treaty

1514
01:55:03.215 --> 01:55:04.520
and also through Detenland.

1515
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:09.680
For both these territories would
have been German territories

1516
01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:11.920
for the simple rights of the people

1517
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:13.520
to self-determination.

1518
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:16.740
I find that interesting.

1519
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:19.832
considering you just
testified that people's

1520
01:55:19.833 --> 01:55:22.440
self-determination was
the first thing you took away.

1521
01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:26.440
From the very beginning.

1522
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.300
you regarded the elimination of
Jews from the economic life of Germany

1523
01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:36.420
as one phase of the four-year plan
under your jurisdiction. Is that correct?

1524
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:38.100
Partially correct.

1525
01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.840
Partially. I see.

1526
01:55:41.165 --> 01:55:44.540
I would like to review with you briefly

1527
01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:48.840
public acts taken by you in
reference to the Jewish question.

1528
01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:52.480
First. did you proclaim the Nuremberg Laws?

1529
01:55:55.305 --> 01:55:56.540
Yes. I did.

1530
01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.760
As president of the
Reichstag. that was my job.

1531
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.400
What date was that?

1532
01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.760
The 15th of September. 1935.

1533
01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:08.100
And on the first day of December 1936.

1534
01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:11.160
you passed an act making it
a death penalty for Germans

1535
01:56:11.410 --> 01:56:12.640
to transfer property abroad?

1536
01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:14.760
That is correct.

1537
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.920
That was the decree governing
restriction on foreign contracts.

1538
01:56:17.921 --> 01:56:19.520
And on April 22. 1938.

1539
01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:20.860
you published penalties

1540
01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:24.420
within the Reich.

1541
01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.880
Concealing.

1542
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.920
Then on April 26. 1938.

1543
01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.524
you signed a decree
ordering the registration of

1544
01:56:30.525 --> 01:56:33.140
all Jewish property inside
and outside of Germany.

1545
01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:37.500
If it is signed by me... Then a
decree on November 12. 1938

1546
01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:42.380
imposing a fine of one billion
Reichsmarks for atonement on all Jews.

1547
01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.580
And that all damages
caused to Jewish property

1548
01:56:45.905 --> 01:56:47.340
by the riots of 1938

1549
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.160
are many details here.

1550
01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.800
The insurance company... And the
decree on the 17th of September 1940

1551
01:56:58.801 --> 01:57:01.840
ordering the sequestration of
all Jewish property in Poland.

1552
01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:04.857
Yeah. in that part of
Poland that was a former

1553
01:57:04.858 --> 01:57:07.660
German province and
would return to Germany.

1554
01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.580
A decree asking Himmler and Heydrich

1555
01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:14.520
to make plans for
the final solution

1556
01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:15.820
of the Jewish question.

1557
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:24.130
That is not correct.

1558
01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:26.190
I know that decree very well.

1559
01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:28.750
I ask that you show

1560
01:57:29.730 --> 01:57:30.730
the document number 1110.

1561
01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.650
exhibit number USA509.

1562
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:37.648
I think it should be
read into the record so

1563
01:57:37.649 --> 01:57:39.910
we may have no argument
about its translation.

1564
01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:47.400
That document is signed

1565
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:49.240
by you. is it not?

1566
01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:51.900
Is that just correct?

1567
01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.360
Please correct me if I am wrong.

1568
01:57:57.430 --> 01:58:00.890
Supplementing the task that
was assigned to you on 1-24-1939.

1569
01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.390
which dealt with arriving at

1570
01:58:04.345 --> 01:58:07.330
through furtherance of immigration
and. in fact. the evacuation.

1571
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:11.550
A solution of the Jewish problem
as advantageous as possible.

1572
01:58:11.770 --> 01:58:12.770
I hereby charge you

1573
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:15.443
with making all
necessary preparations in

1574
01:58:15.444 --> 01:58:18.090
regards to organizational
and financial matters

1575
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:19.790
for bringing about

1576
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:22.230
a final solution

1577
01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:24.230
of the Jewish question.

1578
01:58:25.570 --> 01:58:26.570
He's got them.

1579
01:58:29.710 --> 01:58:30.810
Am I correct so far?

1580
01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.371
No. your translation
is not correct.

1581
01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:41.090
Then please give
us your translation.

1582
01:58:46.230 --> 01:58:48.791
Supplementing the
task which was entrusted

1583
01:58:49.570 --> 01:58:54.030
to you in the decree
dated January 21. 1939

1584
01:58:54.031 --> 01:58:57.430
to solve the Jewish question
by immigration and evacuation

1585
01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:00.190
in the most favorable way possible.

1586
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:03.810
Given present conditions.

1587
01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:05.330
I hereby commission you

1588
01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:09.008
to carry out all necessary
preparations with regard to

1589
01:59:09.009 --> 01:59:12.510
organizational substantive
and financial viewpoints.

1590
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:17.110
Now. here is the sentence

1591
01:59:17.610 --> 01:59:20.730
for a complete solution.

1592
01:59:21.225 --> 01:59:22.370
not a final solution.

1593
01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:24.370
for a total solution

1594
01:59:24.650 --> 01:59:26.070
of the Jewish question.

1595
01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.780
A complete and total solution.

1596
01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.100
Complete and total. yeah.

1597
01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:39.341
A complete and total solution you
wanted the chief of the SS to enact.

1598
01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:42.870
Yeah. but I would like
to make an explanation.

1599
01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:44.920
Oh. please do.

1600
01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.660
I sent this letter

1601
01:59:49.135 --> 01:59:51.380
to Himmler and to Heydrich

1602
01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:57.910
because it was some 18 months now since the
declaration of the 24th of January. 1939

1603
01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:01.421
and Heydrich had
achieved very little.

1604
02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:06.261
So I charged him to accelerate the task of
dealing with the immigration of the Jews.

1605
02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:10.960
Immigration. you contend

1606
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:13.120
was about immigration?

1607
02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:16.900
It says so in the first line.

1608
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:28.350
That's just the first sentence.

1609
02:00:28.570 --> 02:00:30.970
The letter goes on
to state My desire

1610
02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.790
for a complete solution
to the Jewish problem

1611
02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:38.635
and an end to their
financial influence by

1612
02:00:38.636 --> 02:00:41.790
their emigration and
evacuation from Germany.

1613
02:00:44.195 --> 02:00:47.450
It is in this document
that you present to me.

1614
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.340
Are there any more questions
for the witness. Justice Jackson?

1615
02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:11.980
Mr. Justice.

1616
02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:14.020
is the witness excused?

1617
02:01:21.635 --> 02:01:22.635
I have a question.

1618
02:01:29.130 --> 02:01:32.214
The tribunal was under
the impression the American

1619
02:01:32.215 --> 02:01:35.650
prosecutor would be
examining this witness today.

1620
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:38.310
The United States is always

1621
02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.051
happy to hear from our distinguished
colleague from Great Britain.

1622
02:01:52.090 --> 02:01:53.870
It won't take more than a moment.

1623
02:01:55.590 --> 02:02:00.990
You've implied to this court that you lost
some influence with Adolf Hitler in 1942.

1624
02:02:01.170 --> 02:02:02.170
Is that correct?

1625
02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:05.470
I believe this to be the case. yes.

1626
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:09.090
But you were still Reichsmarshal
of Germany in 1942.

1627
02:02:10.255 --> 02:02:12.250
Hitler's successor. yes?

1628
02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:16.850
Yes. I was the Reichsmarschall.

1629
02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:20.670
And you're telling me that
you were totally unaware

1630
02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:23.840
that three million Jews
were murdered in 1942?

1631
02:02:29.850 --> 02:02:31.350
I was unaware of this.

1632
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:32.850
In 1943.

1633
02:02:33.610 --> 02:02:35.230
at least 800.000 Jews

1634
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:37.270
were executed in the camps.

1635
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:38.650
You were still Reichsmarshal

1636
02:02:39.175 --> 02:02:40.750
in 1943. is that correct?

1637
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:43.890
That is correct.

1638
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:45.570
In 1944.

1639
02:02:46.230 --> 02:02:48.130
an additional 800.000 Jews

1640
02:02:48.730 --> 02:02:49.730
died in the camps.

1641
02:02:50.190 --> 02:02:51.410
You were still Reichsmarshal

1642
02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:53.410
in 1944. is that correct?

1643
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:56.030
That is correct.

1644
02:02:56.370 --> 02:02:57.430
In 1945.

1645
02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:00.130
250.000.

1646
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.610
an estimated

1647
02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.690
six million Jews in total.

1648
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:06.390
as well as Soviet and Polish citizens.

1649
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:08.470
Romani people.

1650
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:11.250
artists. scientists. writers.

1651
02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:12.570
journalists. photographers.

1652
02:03:13.090 --> 02:03:14.690
filmmakers. people killed.

1653
02:03:15.230 --> 02:03:16.230
not in combat.

1654
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:18.430
not in enemy fire.

1655
02:03:18.730 --> 02:03:21.430
but exterminated by the state of Germany.

1656
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:25.190
The state which you
were the Reichsmarshal of.

1657
02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:28.310
the preeminent political
post of your country.

1658
02:03:29.310 --> 02:03:30.310
You contend

1659
02:03:31.515 --> 02:03:33.310
that you had no knowledge.

1660
02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:40.530
At least give me this.

1661
02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.010
Knowing what we know now.

1662
02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:46.250
knowing what happened

1663
02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:48.610
to six million Jews.

1664
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:49.790
I have to ask.

1665
02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.120
would you still follow

1666
02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:57.680
the Fuhrer. Adolf Hitler?

1667
02:03:57.681 --> 02:03:58.681
Yeah.

1668
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:11.470
Eiffel.

1669
02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:17.000
Order! Order!

1670
02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:22.460
Heil Hitler.

1671
02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280
No further questions.

1672
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:39.220
I think this is as good a place
as any to adjourn for the day.

1673
02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.880
Oh. great.

1674
02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240
Absolutely great.

1675
02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:51.260
I survived.

1676
02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.320
You did.

1677
02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:19.090
You were right.

1678
02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:23.010
I couldn't beat him.

1679
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:25.030
Not without help.

1680
02:05:26.230 --> 02:05:27.830
Gering cannot stand against the Fuhrer.

1681
02:05:28.090 --> 02:05:29.570
Invaluable information. doctor.

1682
02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.180
So what now?

1683
02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:38.760
As Gering falls. so do they all.

1684
02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:40.740
We'll be okay.

1685
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Here.

1686
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:47.950
You off?

1687
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:52.130
One more thing you have to do.

1688
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:17.490
You helped them. didn't you?

1689
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:19.930
I did.

1690
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:22.950
I'm leaving.

1691
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:26.070
Leaving?

1692
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:28.830
Going home.

1693
02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:32.390
I've come to say goodbye.

1694
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:38.010
What do we do now. doctor?

1695
02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:41.300
Do we shake hands?

1696
02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:48.020
I know we were friends. Douglas.

1697
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:51.950
For a while.

1698
02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.080
Goodbye. Hermann.

1699
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.480
Years from now.

1700
02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:14.000
happen to what you say about us.

1701
02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:17.220
Will you even acknowledge we were human?

1702
02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:41.880
The judgment of the International
Military Tribunal will now be read.

1703
02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:46.360
Each defendant will be addressed in turn.

1704
02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.680
Hermann Gering.

1705
02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:54.580
the evidence shows that after Hitler.

1706
02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:58.940
you were the most prominent
man in the Nazi regime.

1707
02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:04.660
Your guilt is unique in its enormity.

1708
02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:08.840
Your record discloses no excuses.

1709
02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:17.080
The International Military Tribunal
sentences you to death by hanging.

1710
02:08:28.770 --> 02:08:30.050
Rudolf Hess.

1711
02:08:30.690 --> 02:08:32.250
you are indicted.

1712
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:39.130
The executions are
scheduled for midnight tonight.

1713
02:08:40.410 --> 02:08:46.593
In order to maintain discipline. the
prisoners will not be informed until 11.

1714
02:08:46.953 --> 02:08:51.410
45 pm. when they will be awakened
in their cells and offered last rites.

1715
02:08:52.170 --> 02:08:56.390
At 8 pm. eight hand-picked
journalists will arrive at the prison.

1716
02:08:57.330 --> 02:09:00.890
Two French. two British.
two American. two Russian.

1717
02:09:02.190 --> 02:09:03.583
Lights out is at 9.

1718
02:09:04.263 --> 02:09:06.830
30. which is when the doctor
will do his normal final rounds.

1719
02:09:07.530 --> 02:09:12.050
Any prisoner requesting a sleep aid
will be given a placebo with baking soda.

1720
02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:15.690
At 10 o'clock.

1721
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:18.570
we will bring the press
down to the gallows.

1722
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:22.290
where I will brief them of the
final preparations for tonight.

1723
02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:17.830
The prisoners will be brought in one by one

1724
02:10:17.831 --> 02:10:21.170
and given the opportunity
to speak their last words.

1725
02:10:22.050 --> 02:10:23.050
They will then...

1726
02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:33.560
Who is it?

1727
02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:34.720
Gering. sir.

1728
02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:44.120
No. no. no. no!

1729
02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:46.656
No. you son of a bitch!
You don't get to do this!

1730
02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:49.700
He's dead. sir.
Sign. I... God damn it!

1731
02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:01.020
I'm sorry. sir.

1732
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:02.890
We have a decision to make.

1733
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:06.890
We can either scrub the
executions for tonight or proceed.

1734
02:11:07.810 --> 02:11:08.930
Let's just get home with it.

1735
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:12.710
Sir. I... Stryker is refusing
to put his clothes on.

1736
02:11:12.711 --> 02:11:13.711
Come on.

1737
02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:17.050
Get out of here!

1738
02:11:17.710 --> 02:11:20.490
You fucking stupid whore!

1739
02:11:20.970 --> 02:11:22.430
Let him go! Let him go!

1740
02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:35.450
Julius.

1741
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:41.990
Julius.

1742
02:11:54.670 --> 02:11:56.721
You... You...

1743
02:11:58.590 --> 02:12:00.140
You have been defended.

1744
02:12:12.130 --> 02:12:13.130
Come on.

1745
02:12:15.210 --> 02:12:16.370
Let's do it together.

1746
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:19.550
Come on.

1747
02:12:21.810 --> 02:12:22.810
Give me a shirt.

1748
02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:23.660
Ask him his name.

1749
02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:26.720
You know my name.

1750
02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:28.600
Any last words?

1751
02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:32.380
Cool him. feast 1946.

1752
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.960
For she victim...

1753
02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.160
Benziadis Tagus Hagen!

1754
02:13:44.185 --> 02:13:49.850
Oh. damn it!

1755
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:56.030
Why do you leave the bar?

1756
02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:42.940
Yes. Kay.

1757
02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:00.280
I have to be honest. Dr. Kelly.

1758
02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:03.440
I find some of the conclusions
in your book quite unbelievable.

1759
02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:08.980
You were dealing with the Nazis.
who you must admit are unique people.

1760
02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:11.460
They are not unique people.

1761
02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:15.900
There are people like the Nazis
in every country in the world today.

1762
02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:17.060
Not in America.

1763
02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:18.560
Yes. in America.

1764
02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.320
Their personality patterns are not obscure.

1765
02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:24.680
There are people who want to be in power.

1766
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.020
And while you say they don't exist
here. I would say I'm quite certain

1767
02:16:29.021 --> 02:16:31.819
there are people in
America who would willingly

1768
02:16:31.831 --> 02:16:34.820
climb over the corpses
of half the American public

1769
02:16:34.821 --> 02:16:37.580
if they knew they could
gain control of the other half.

1770
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:38.580
Doctor. please.

1771
02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:40.680
They stoke hatred.

1772
02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:45.920
It's what Hitler and Göring
did. and it is textbook.

1773
02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:49.100
And if you think the next time it happens

1774
02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:52.680
we're going to recognize it because
they're wearing scary uniforms.

1775
02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:56.840
you're out of your damn mind.

1776
02:17:02.850 --> 02:17:04.850
More with our panel when we return.

1777
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:09.690
Yeah. uh-huh.

1778
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:13.310
They're not going to invite
you to stay for the next segment.

1779
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:15.330
Let's go.

1780
02:17:21.515 --> 02:17:26.410
And just so you know.

1781
02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:31.530
trashing our country is probably
not the best way to sell your book.
