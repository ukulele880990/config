- Till all of your lifeless
bodies

181
00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:28.322
are hanging from an overpass.

182
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.542
- Hey. hey. Shut the fuck
up was not a request.

183
00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:33.197
Shut up. Phil!

184
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.764
- You have the right to remain
silent.

185
00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:36.243
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

186
00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:37.549
[blows striking]

187
00:10:37.592 --> 00:10:38.942
[both groaning]

188
00:10:40.552 --> 00:10:42.162
[kick striking]

189
00:10:42.206 --> 00:10:43.598
You okay?

190
00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:46.079
[blows striking]

191
00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:47.428
[dramatic music]

192
00:10:47.472 --> 00:10:49.561
- If you can't afford an
attorney

193
00:10:49.604 --> 00:10:51.519
one will be appointed for you.

194
00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:54.261
[kick striking]

195
00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:56.786
Have you understood these rights
as I have read them to you?

196
00:10:56.829 --> 00:11:00.093
Hey. amigo. Buddy?

197
00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:01.486
Ah. shit.

198
00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:04.271
Hey. Mark. do you think
he heard that last part

199
00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:06.578
or am I gonna have to read
him his whole Miranda rights

200
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:09.842
warning all over again.
because I don't wanna.

201
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:11.148
- Well. judging by his rap
sheet.

202
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.627
I think he's heard it before.

203
00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.369
You. uh. look clean.

204
00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:17.284
Your guy. he was a lot smaller.

205
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.288
- True. Maybe you should cuff
him.

206
00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:22.420
I don't know if you
have the punching power

207
00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:24.596
to keep him out very long.

208
00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.511
- Oh. he's got jokes.
and white pants. Heh.

209
00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:29.949
Hey. it is not a good time.

210
00:11:30.733 --> 00:11:34.127
[soft mournful music]

211
00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:15.386
We are gathered here today

212
00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.344
to celebrate the life
of our brother Akheem.

213
00:12:20.608 --> 00:12:22.741
I have known Akheem's mother.
Yvonne.

214
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.395
and his brother Mark for a long
time.

215
00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:29.052
I can remember the day Akheem
was born.

216
00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:34.535
bringing with him into this
world. and to this island.

217
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:36.494
that infectious smile that all
of us

218
00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:38.496
would soon know and love.

219
00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:43.544
I ask all of you now to
remember fondly Akheem

220
00:12:43.588 --> 00:12:45.155
and his infectious smile.

221
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.725
But also to let his
tragic death be a reminder

222
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.554
that we must collectively
guard the lives of our youths.

223
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.210
Because make no mistake about
it.

224
00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:02.650
whereas our island is
surely a gift from God.

225
00:13:02.694 --> 00:13:06.045
lest we forget the devil does
not strike at us from afar.

226
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:11.746
No. He slithers along
the soil we call home.

227
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:14.662
Waiting to coil around the feet

228
00:13:14.706 --> 00:13:16.708
of any who dare oppose him.

229
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:20.146
[soft mournful music]

230
00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:38.077
Yvonne. I am so sorry.

231
00:13:40.732 --> 00:13:42.603
Thank you. Akilah.

232
00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:45.868
[soft piano music]

233
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:49.088
Please. come see me soon.

234
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:53.571
[Yvonne crying]

235
00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:58.706
- We never met. I'm Manuel
Alvarez.

236
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.667
I'm terribly sorry. My deepest
condolence.

237
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.627
[soft piano music]

238
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:09.282
If there is anything I can do
for you. please let me know.

239
00:14:14.026 --> 00:14:16.246
I'm so sorry for your loss.

240
00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:19.162
[soft mournful music]

241
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:33.611
[door closing]

242
00:14:33.654 --> 00:14:36.570
[soft mournful music]

243
00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:41.749
- I'm sorry. Son. I didn't get
a chance to clean the house.

244
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:43.055
Mom. it's fine. it's fine.

245
00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.187
- But I'm glad you're home.
baby.

246
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.666
Me too.

247
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.017
- Let me get you something
to eat. You must be hungry.

248
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.193
- No. Mom. Mom. Mom. please.
please stop.

249
00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:51.716
I just want you to relax.

250
00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:54.545
You don't need to be doing
anything right now. Come. sit.

251
00:14:54.588 --> 00:14:55.372
Come. sit.

252
00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:59.376
- I have some things from your
brother.

253
00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:00.290
Okay.

254
00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:02.466
[soft music]

255
00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:25.968
He was wearing that when ...

256
00:15:27.752 --> 00:15:29.493
I'd like you to have it.

257
00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:31.712
[soft music]

258
00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:36.674
Thanks. Mom.

259
00:15:36.717 --> 00:15:39.068
[soft music]

260
00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:43.768
Tell me what happened.

261
00:15:44.812 --> 00:15:46.684
I don't. I don't know.

262
00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:49.948
He got a job. and he was
staying out of trouble.

263
00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:51.906
Trouble?

264
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.735
- A lot has changed over
the past seven years

265
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.346
since you've been gone. Son.

266
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.610
The island just isn't the same
anymore.

267
00:15:59.653 --> 00:16:00.872
- I'm gonna find out what
happened.

268
00:16:00.915 --> 00:16:04.832
- No. no. Mark. I just
lost one of my sons.

269
00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:06.747
I cannot lose another.

270
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.185
Mom. listen to me. okay?

271
00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:14.842
Everything is gonna be
okay. Just trust me.

272
00:16:14.886 --> 00:16:16.061
Get some rest. okay?

273
00:16:17.671 --> 00:16:19.847
[Yvonne sobbing]

274
00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:22.807
[soft music]

275
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.504
It's gonna be okay.

276
00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:27.681
[Yvonne crying]

277
00:16:27.725 --> 00:16:30.075
Hey. Mom. it's gonna be all
right.

278
00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:33.078
[Yvonne crying]

279
00:16:33.122 --> 00:16:34.601
Get some rest.

280
00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:36.908
Okay [cries].

281
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.345
[soft music]

282
00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:32.050

[soft music]

285
00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:01.558
- I swear to God. it's not our
stuff.

286
00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:02.950
I'm telling you. tell him.

287
00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:04.735
- Yo. somebody put that
in our car. I promise you.

288
00:18:04.778 --> 00:18:06.128
- We've been set up. We were set
up.

289
00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:07.868
A complete misunderstanding.

290
00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:09.827
It's a big misunderstanding.
okay?

291
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.828
It's the truth. I swear.

292
00:18:12.786 --> 00:18:14.875
[knocking on door]

293
00:18:14.919 --> 00:18:16.834
[Nate chuckling]

294
00:18:16.877 --> 00:18:18.140
Yes. Brother.

295
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.447
Long time.

296
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:22.709
Yeah. Sit down. sit down.

297
00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:29.890
I'm really sorry about Akheem.

298
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:33.459
He was a good kid.

299
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:34.286
Thank you.

300
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:37.202
So what have you found out?

301
00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:45.471
- We go way back. so I'm just
gonna give it to you straight.

302
00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:48.518
We don't have the same
manpower that you do in LA.

303
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:49.780
I remember.

304
00:18:49.823 --> 00:18:50.650
So this.

305
00:18:53.218 --> 00:18:54.654
this is gonna take some time.

306
00:18:57.222 --> 00:18:59.616
And right now. we don't have
a whole lot to go off of.

307
00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:09.016
This is all you have?

308
00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:12.368
- That's everything from the
table.

309
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.066
Maybe a fight with the gangs.

310
00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:15.936
Gangs?

311
00:19:18.112 --> 00:19:20.898
- Yeah. there's been a lotta
crime

312
00:19:20.941 --> 00:19:22.943
here on the island since you
been gone.

313
00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:24.815
Especially with gangs
from neighboring islands

314
00:19:24.858 --> 00:19:25.946
coming here to party.

315
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.861
The drug traffic is way up.

316
00:19:29.254 --> 00:19:31.996
- So you think this is
gang-related?

317
00:19:34.955 --> 00:19:35.782
Like I say.

318
00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:39.699
this is gonna take some time to
find out

319
00:19:39.743 --> 00:19:42.136
what actually happened.

320
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.444
But when I do. you'll
be the first to know.

321
00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:48.055
All right.

Bye. Sensei.

348
00:20:36.887 --> 00:20:37.844
See you guys next week.

349
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.242
So. how's the big city treating
you?

350
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.985
- Well. not a day goes
by that I don't think

351
00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:51.815
about the island. if
that's what you're asking.

352
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.078
But you left.

353
00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:56.123
And you know why I left?

354
00:20:58.038 --> 00:20:58.865
Yeah.

355
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:03.000
So. um ...

356
00:21:04.436 --> 00:21:06.786

[soft music]

358
00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:13.140
No.

359
00:21:15.317 --> 00:21:16.143
You?

360
00:21:18.755 --> 00:21:19.582
No.

up with your training.

now.

Mark.

How long are you staying for?

375
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.977
- Long enough to find out
what happened to Akheem.

376
00:22:08.282 --> 00:22:10.502
I went to the police
station to talk to Nate.

377
00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:14.288
He says there are gangs
here on the island.

378
00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:16.421
Unfortunately. yeah.

379
00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:18.858
The gangs come over on the
weekends from other islands

380
00:22:18.902 --> 00:22:21.252
and bring with them more drugs
and crime.

381
00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:24.037
But I wouldn't hold on to too
much hope

382
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:26.170
in whatever Nate says or does.

383
00:22:26.213 --> 00:22:27.127
Why is that?

384
00:22:29.129 --> 00:22:31.784
- Because people around here
are afraid to make waves.

385
00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:33.612
I'm listening.

386
00:22:35.614 --> 00:22:39.226
- This guy. Manuel
Alvarez. everyone calls him

387
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.924
the Company because he owns
everything

388
00:22:40.967 --> 00:22:43.100
that's important on the island.

389
00:22:43.143 --> 00:22:47.060
He owns the bank. construction
companies. hotels.

390
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.891
In less than four years. he
basically managed to control

391
00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:54.546
the entire economy of the
island.

392
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.157
Not to mention the only
places that the gangs seem

393
00:22:57.201 --> 00:23:00.204
to avoid are the businesses he
owns.

394
00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:01.510
And I'm pretty sure he controls
them too.

395
00:23:01.553 --> 00:23:04.991
just to scare the people on the
island.

396
00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:07.341
So whether they like it
or not. a lot of people

397
00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:09.561
around here rely on him to
survive.

398
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.564

399
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.480
Yeah.

400
00:23:15.524 --> 00:23:17.656
- She's working at the bank
and told me in confidence

401
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.093
that hundreds of millions
go through the bank now.

402
00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:24.010
- But what does that
have to do with Akheem?

403
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.320
- Two months ago. Akheem took a
job

404
00:23:29.363 --> 00:23:32.192
as a bartender working for
Alvarez.

405

It's okay.

No.

So. how can I help you?

426
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.104
My brother worked for you?

427
00:24:58.148 --> 00:25:00.716
- He did. A lot of people work
for me.

428
00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:03.370
Mm. Here at this bar?

429
00:25:03.414 --> 00:25:06.460
- Yes. And he was a good
bartender.

430
00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.853
- So you're aware that
my brother was killed

431
00:25:07.897 --> 00:25:09.594
the night he was working here?

432
00:25:09.638 --> 00:25:12.292
You know. I don't think I like

433
00:25:12.336 --> 00:25:13.990
the implication you are making.

434
00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:16.906

think?

435
00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:20.083
What the fuck happened to my
brother?

436
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.828
You are upset. and I get it.

437
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:28.570
And I'm here to help.

may have gotten himself

other islands hang out.

you grew up on. Not anymore.

keeps telling me that.

454
00:26:14.485 --> 00:26:18.489
- Change is inevitable.
Good and bad. I'm afraid.

- You're right about
that. Changes are coming.

business off of the island.

[spits].

549
00:31:46.077 --> 00:31:47.600
- You wanna tell me about my
brother now?

550
00:31:47.644 --> 00:31:48.950
Fuck your brother.

- That's right. Had it. didn't
need it.

556
00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:11.233
I could use it now if you like.

557
00:32:13.626 --> 00:32:16.238
- I don't know him. I never met
him.

558
00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:17.891
We were just told to fuck some
dude up

559
00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:18.849
looking for his brother.

560
00:32:19.937 --> 00:32:21.852
That's all I know. I swear.

Yo. you guys see him anywhere?

584
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.420
Shit. we lost him.

585
00:33:53.117 --> 00:33:53.900

Fuck. I'll call him.

589
00:34:11.614 --> 00:34:13.529
We lost him.

590
00:34:13.572 --> 00:34:15.879
- [Manuel] That's very
disappointing.

591
00:34:15.922 --> 00:34:18.273
I will deal with your failures
later.

592
00:34:18.316 --> 00:34:21.972
Go to the mother's house.
Use her to flush him out.

593
00:34:22.015 --> 00:34:23.104
Understood.

[suspenseful music]

603
00:36:40.806 --> 00:36:42.243
Here you go.

604
00:36:42.286 --> 00:36:43.722
Thank you.

605
00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:44.549
Don't mention it.

606
00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:51.426
Yvonne. everything is going to
be okay.

607
00:36:52.296 --> 00:36:54.820
He's going to be okay.

608
00:36:54.864 --> 00:36:58.650

mother. you always have to worry.

[soft piano music]

610
00:37:02.959 --> 00:37:06.005
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

611
00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:07.137
I'm so sorry.

612
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.138
It's okay.

613
00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:12.969
You know I really wish
that I could tell you

614
00:37:13.012 --> 00:37:15.188
that after losing a child it
gets easier.

615
00:37:16.886 --> 00:37:18.714
But even after seven years.

616
00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:21.630
it doesn't.

617
00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:28.027

You two good?

620
00:37:32.118 --> 00:37:33.294
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

621
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:36.340
- You have a first-aid kit?

622
00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:38.255
Yeah. I'll go grab it.

623
00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:39.387
All right.

624

[police radio chattering]

625
00:37:45.958 --> 00:37:47.873
All right. so what we got?

626
00:37:47.917 --> 00:37:50.702
- We have a DOA. The rest
have gone on to the hospital.

627
00:37:53.009 --> 00:37:55.881
- Jesus Christ. These boys got
hit hard.

628
00:37:57.448 --> 00:37:58.362
Who else see it?

629
00:37:58.406 --> 00:37:59.102
No one's talking.

630
00:38:00.364 --> 00:38:02.845
[Nate sighing]

631
00:38:02.888 --> 00:38:04.281
- All right. I'll take it from
here.

632
00:38:04.325 --> 00:38:05.717
Just make sure you secure the
perimeter.

633
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:06.544
Yes. sir.

634
00:38:08.111 --> 00:38:08.938
Excuse me. sir.

635
00:38:08.981 --> 00:38:10.331
Yes. Officer.

636
00:38:10.374 --> 00:38:11.680
- The station has been
trying to get hold of you.

637
00:38:11.723 --> 00:38:12.898
What is it?

638
00:38:12.942 --> 00:38:13.986
- They say there's a possible
crime scene

639
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.466
that you'd want to know about.

640
00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:18.382
- I have a crime scene here
already.

641
00:38:18.426 --> 00:38:20.993
- It's at Akheem's mother's
house.

642
00:38:21.037 --> 00:38:23.082
[soft dramatic music]

643
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:25.171
Tell them I'm on my way.

644
00:38:25.215 --> 00:38:26.390
Okay. sir.

645
00:38:26.434 --> 00:38:28.305

646
00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:37.053
[knocking on door]

647
00:38:42.232 --> 00:38:44.843
Good thing nobody was home.

648
00:38:44.887 --> 00:38:45.888
This time.

649
00:38:49.413 --> 00:38:51.110
- Any idea what happened
to a buncha gang members

650
00:38:51.154 --> 00:38:52.982
earlier tonight at the beach
bar?

651
00:38:53.025 --> 00:38:54.940
Hm?

652
00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:57.247
- Any idea what happened
to my brother or who tried

653
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.118
to break into my mother's
house and kill her?

654
00:39:00.293 --> 00:39:03.993
- You have no idea what you
are asking of me right now.

655
00:39:05.864 --> 00:39:08.737
This? This is so much
bigger than your brother.

656
00:39:10.042 --> 00:39:13.219
- You're right. It's not gonna
stop.

657
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:15.178
Not unless you help me to make
it stop.

658
00:39:17.136 --> 00:39:18.007
- I think you already know the
answers

659
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.835
to the questions you're asking.

660
00:39:19.878 --> 00:39:22.533
This is our island. our home.

661
00:39:24.579 --> 00:39:28.017
My father build this
house with his bare hands

662
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.627
just like your father built
yours.

663
00:39:30.976 --> 00:39:33.283
They wanted my mother to be
there. Nate.

664
00:39:34.458 --> 00:39:35.590
Changes are coming.

665
00:39:37.505 --> 00:39:39.898
And you need to decide
what side of those changes

666
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:41.422
you're gonna be standing on.

667
00:39:41.465 --> 00:39:44.599
[soft dramatic music]

668
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.957
- Speak to the Luna's new
singer.

669
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:58.090
One of my informants
told me she was working

670
00:39:58.134 --> 00:39:59.875
the night your brother was
killed.

671
00:40:00.963 --> 00:40:02.399
Her name's Nora.

672
00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:04.880
She's staying at the motel
by the church. Room 18.

673
00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:08.100
[soft dramatic music]

674
00:40:08.144 --> 00:40:09.580
Is your mother somewhere safe?

675
00:40:10.494 --> 00:40:11.060
Yeah.

676
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:14.542
At Akilah's place.

677
00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:16.587
Good.

678
00:40:19.198 --> 00:40:20.548
I need to trust you. Nate.

679
00:40:22.201 --> 00:40:25.248
This island needs help.
and I can't do it alone.

680
00:40:25.683 --> 00:40:28.817
[soft dramatic music]

681
00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:52.101
[lighter clicking]

682
00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:58.324
- I don't think the word
disappointed carries enough weight

683
00:40:58.368 --> 00:41:00.152
for what I'm feeling right now.

684
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:02.459
- We did what you asked. Boss.
after we lost him in town.

685
00:41:02.503 --> 00:41:06.550
but the house. it's empty.

686
00:41:06.594 --> 00:41:08.944
They must have known someone was
coming.

687
00:41:08.987 --> 00:41:11.512
So. this was my fault?

688
00:41:12.034 --> 00:41:14.253
- No. no. that's not what I
meant. no.

689
00:41:14.297 --> 00:41:16.908
- Sh. It's okay. forget about
it.

690
00:41:18.388 --> 00:41:19.868
You tried. right?

691
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:22.044
You did the best you could
with the information you had.

692
00:41:22.087 --> 00:41:24.089
but they knew you were coming.

693
00:41:25.134 --> 00:41:25.961
Right?

694
00:41:27.005 --> 00:41:28.267
- Y-yes. sir. Y-yes. sir.

695
00:41:30.748 --> 00:41:32.707
Hey. hey. take it easy.

696
00:41:33.751 --> 00:41:36.493
Take a deep breath before
you're hyperventilating.

697
00:41:36.537 --> 00:41:38.147
[dramatic music]

698
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.193
[assailant gasping]

699
00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:50.420
One thing I can't stand is
excuses.

700
00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:53.162
And a lack of accountability.

701
00:41:54.076 --> 00:41:57.035
[assailant gasping]

702
00:41:58.384 --> 00:41:59.211
Please.

703
00:42:01.474 --> 00:42:02.475
Please. please!

704
00:42:06.001 --> 00:42:06.479
So.

705
00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:07.568
Fuck.

706
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:10.222
- let's get back
to the accountability.

707
00:42:12.355 --> 00:42:13.835
Please. no no no!
Wait wait wait. wait!

708
00:42:13.878 --> 00:42:16.185
I have a photo. in my pocket.

709
00:42:16.228 --> 00:42:19.318
[assailant breathing hard]

00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:22.278
[soft dramatic music]

711
00:42:26.108 --> 00:42:27.500
I think I know how to get this
guy.

712
00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:30.068
She. she's a local. Runs the
island dojo.

713
00:42:31.504 --> 00:42:33.637
[gun firing]

714
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:36.031

00:42:36.074 --> 00:42:39.208
[soft dramatic music]

716
00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:44.996
Are you gonna come back inside

717
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.215
and finish fucking me or what?

718
00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:49.087
I'll be back in a moment.

719
00:42:50.828 --> 00:42:53.875
- This cop? More trouble than we
expected.

720
00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:57.226
He put the boys in the
north gang in the hospital.

721
00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:03.275
- Make a call to our
special friends. okay?

722
00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:06.496

you two were the same age.

you.

You too.

951

Are you sure this is okay?

952
01:00:18.788 --> 01:00:20.311
Of course.

953
01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:21.443
Dayana and I wish that there
was more we could do to help.

954

and Akilah

955
01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:26.448
is more than enough. bro.

956
01:00:26.491 --> 01:00:28.668
- You mean taking care of your
mother.

957
01:00:28.711 --> 01:00:30.365
I'm not staying.

958
01:00:30.408 --> 01:00:31.540
Akilah. you need to stay here.

959
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:35.152

there for my island.

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:36.588
Akilah. please.

961

I can't even remember the
last time I came to church.

As one of God's children.

975

all that matters is that you are
here now.

976
01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:43.264
Go on. What is on your mind. my
son?

977
01:01:44.961 --> 01:01:46.397

do something for me.

Please keep it safe.

979
01:01:51.446 --> 01:01:53.230
- I don't understand. What is
it?

980
01:01:54.579 --> 01:01:56.451
If anything happens to me.

981
01:01:56.494 --> 01:01:58.061

you'll know what to do.

I take care. don't worry about
it. okay?

989
01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:29.571
I might have a solution.

990
01:02:29.614 --> 01:02:32.052
- You better. because if they
have her.

991
01:02:32.095 --> 01:02:34.228
then she can testify against
you.

992
01:02:34.271 --> 01:02:35.490
I'll find her.

993
01:02:35.533 --> 01:02:37.013
No you won't.

994
01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:39.059
If she's gone. it means they got
to her.

995
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.410
And if they got to her. then
that means

996
01:02:42.453 --> 01:02:44.716
they can bring an international
warrant against me.

997
01:02:46.588 --> 01:02:48.720
And if you're still here.

998
01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:51.811
it means that little piece
of shit is still breathing.

999
01:02:51.854 --> 01:02:54.509

play.

if you're willing to play it.

1001

it. Do what it takes.

1002
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.384
It's messy.

1003

- Everything I did for this
island

1004
01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:04.519
is in jeopardy because of this
man!

1005
01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:07.739

I have to. believe me.

01:03:33.548 --> 01:03:34.897
Nate make a case against him.

1010
01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:37.247
And put an end to all of this.

1011
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.206
With that singer's testimony.

1012
01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.469
he'll spend the rest of his life
in jail.

1013
01:03:41.512 --> 01:03:44.385
- Because guys like him
don't end up in jail. Akilah.

1014
01:03:45.603 --> 01:03:48.432
- Mark. he's never going to
stop.

1015
01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:49.216
And neither am I.

1016
01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:53.263
There's only one way this ends.

1017
01:03:56.092 --> 01:04:00.270
- To carry a life inside
of me. for nine months.

1018
01:04:01.445 --> 01:04:03.404
one that you and I created
together.

1019
01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:08.844
And to never get to hear her
cry.

1020
01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:13.849
Or see her open her eyes to look
at me.

1021
01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:16.199
To never get to hold her against
my skin.

1022
01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:19.289
Or see her take her first steps.

1023
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.075
Or watch her grow up.

1024
01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:23.903
Akilah.

1025
01:04:23.946 --> 01:04:26.296
It broke me. in more ways

1026
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.689
than I ever thought was
possible.

1027
01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:35.131
I was so. so numb to everything
that wasn't heartache.

1028
01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.092
And I know it broke you too.

1029
01:04:40.745 --> 01:04:43.531
It broke you so much
that you had to leave.

1030
01:04:43.574 --> 01:04:45.489
- Akilah. why are you
talking about this now?

1031
01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:47.927
- Because nothing that either of
us does

1032
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:49.189
will ever bring her back.

1033
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.843
She's gone. Mark.

1034
01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:54.585
You can't save her.

1035
01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:56.631
But I can save our island.

1036
01:04:56.674 --> 01:04:57.849
But at what cost?

1037
01:05:00.374 --> 01:05:02.506
I don't want to lose you too.

1038
01:05:05.596 --> 01:05:07.685
I don't think that I could
take being broken anymore.

1039
01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:10.471
You will never lose me.

To speak up. To judge fairly.

1086
01:07:56.941 --> 01:07:59.596
Reach out to someone in your
community.

1087
01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.945
One of your neighbors.

1088
01:08:00.989 --> 01:08:03.992
Help those less fortunate than
yourself.

1089
01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:06.560
This is what God--

1090
01:08:06.603 --> 01:08:08.866
[door opening]

1091
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.218
- I'm sorry. Father. May I
please speak with everyone?

1092
01:08:12.261 --> 01:08:14.481
Just for a moment?

1093
01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:15.656
Here.

1094
01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:16.222
Thank you.

1095
01:08:22.315 --> 01:08:26.101
My family immigrated to
this island from the States

1096
01:08:26.145 --> 01:08:28.973
when I was only two years old.

1097
01:08:29.017 --> 01:08:33.978
Many of this community helped
us to build a new life here.

1098
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:36.155
so that we could call
this island our home.

1099
01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:41.247
Now look. I know many of you

1100
01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:44.728
rely on the jobs and the many
businesses

1101
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:48.471
owned by Manuel Alvarez.

1102
01:08:49.994 --> 01:08:51.170
But I'm here to tell you

1103
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.174
that he has taken Akilah hostage

1104
01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:58.960
and has killed both my brother
Akheem

1105
01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:04.661
and now. my friend. our
police chief. Nate Wayland.

1106
01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:08.012
[congregation gasping]

1107
01:09:08.056 --> 01:09:10.972
Nate Wayland died an honorable
man.

1108
01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:14.236
who fought for what's
right and for the island

1109
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.326
that we love and have called
home.

1110
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:22.244
Please. don't let him or
my brother die in vain.

1111
01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:24.725
Help me find Akilah.

1112
01:09:26.335 --> 01:09:28.990
And help me put an end to this
devil

1113
01:09:29.033 --> 01:09:32.428
who has coiled himself around
all our feet

1114
01:09:32.472 --> 01:09:35.214
and is trying to choke the
life out of our island.

1115
01:09:37.303 --> 01:09:40.349
Please. if you hear or see
anything.

1116
01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:43.874
reach out to me at the police
station.

1117
01:09:45.311 --> 01:09:46.137
Thank you.

1118
01:09:47.748 --> 01:09:49.358
- That concludes everything for
today.

1119
01:09:52.883 --> 01:09:55.059
Mark? A moment please.

1120
01:09:56.147 --> 01:09:58.802
[birds singing]

1121
01:10:04.982 --> 01:10:06.288
Nate asked me to hold onto it.

1122
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:10.379
What is it?

1123
01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:11.511
I don't know.

1124
01:10:11.554 --> 01:10:13.252
He said. if something happened
to him.

1125
01:10:14.383 --> 01:10:16.864
And with his passing. I just
think

1126
01:10:16.907 --> 01:10:18.082
he would want you to have it.

1127
01:10:19.693 --> 01:10:21.042
Thank you. Father.

1128
01:10:21.085 --> 01:10:23.871
[dramatic music]

1129
01:10:30.878 --> 01:10:32.401
Wake up. bitch [laughs]!

1130
01:10:37.406 --> 01:10:38.233
Where am I?

1131
01:10:41.845 --> 01:10:43.543
What do you want with me?

1132
01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:46.285
Answer me!

1133
01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:50.419
[soft dramatic music]

1134
01:10:50.463 --> 01:10:53.204
- She's not answering you
because she don't work for you.

1135
01:10:54.423 --> 01:10:55.990
She work for me.

1136
01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:04.085
[sighs] And I'm getting really
tired

1137
01:11:04.128 --> 01:11:07.044
of your boyfriend getting in my
way.

1138
01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:10.309
- Then you're really gonna
be upset when he kills you.

1139
01:11:10.352 --> 01:11:12.963
Oh. aren't you a clever one?

1140
01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:18.360
But it's going to be hard to
be clever without a tongue.

1141
01:11:19.796 --> 01:11:20.754
[Akilah spitting]

1142
01:11:20.797 --> 01:11:23.104
[hand slapping]

1143
01:11:23.147 --> 01:11:24.540
- You're gonna pay for that.
bitch.

1144
01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.761
Then just get it over with and
kill me now

1145
01:11:27.804 --> 01:11:29.023
if you're really gonna do it.

1146
01:11:29.066 --> 01:11:31.242
In time. I'll do just that.

1147
01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:37.466
But unfortunately for
you. it won't be quick.

1148
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:42.428
No. I'm going to take my
time and enjoy so much.

1149
01:11:45.082 --> 01:11:49.913
Eventually. you'll beg me to
kill you.

1150
01:11:49.957 --> 01:11:52.960
[Akilah breathing hard]

1151
01:11:53.003 --> 01:11:56.964
[soft suspenseful music]

1152
01:11:57.007 --> 01:11:58.226
Don't leave her sight.

1153
01:12:02.404 --> 01:12:04.624
[laughing]

1154
01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:07.148
[dramatic music]

1155
01:12:15.417 --> 01:12:16.244
Everyone.

1156
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.464
Listen up.

1157
01:12:19.421 --> 01:12:22.076
[phone ringing]

1158
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:25.993
Nate was a good man who died

1159
01:12:26.036 --> 01:12:28.561
fighting to protect this island.

1160
01:12:28.604 --> 01:12:33.130
And now. I have taken over
as acting chief of police

1161
01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:36.133
so I can do what needs to be
done.

1162
01:12:36.177 --> 01:12:40.616
Now if any of you would like
to leave. you can leave now.

1163
01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:44.707
Good.

1164
01:12:45.882 --> 01:12:48.102
Now the first thing I want you
to do

1165
01:12:48.145 --> 01:12:50.278
is get the word out all across
the island

1166
01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:54.282
that I will be here. waiting for
Alvarez.

1167
01:12:54.325 --> 01:12:57.067

1171
01:13:30.274 --> 01:13:31.101
Ah.

1172
01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:34.148
[suspenseful music]

1173
01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:36.106
Okay.

1174
01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:39.153
Cartel drug money.

1175
01:13:40.502 --> 01:13:43.766
You've been building
a case against Alvarez

1176
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.638
for money laundering.

1177
01:13:47.204 --> 01:13:49.293
Mm. gotcha.

1178
01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:54.211
[children laughing]

1179
01:13:56.039 --> 01:13:56.997
I won!

1180
01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.521
No fair. You're taller.

1181
01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:00.479
[birds singing]

1182
01:14:00.522 --> 01:14:02.176
Look. Desmond.

1183
01:14:02.219 --> 01:14:03.003
Who's that?

1184
01:14:03.046 --> 01:14:03.960
Sh.

1185
01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:06.006
Come on.

[soft suspenseful music]

1187
01:14:15.537 --> 01:14:17.191
That's the guy who's always with
him.

1188
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:22.326
Did he see us?

1189
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:23.240
No.

1190
01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:25.068
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1191
01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:30.030
[phone buzzing]

1192
01:14:34.425 --> 01:14:35.905
Hello.

1193
01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:37.994
- A police officer just came
here looking for the boss.

1194
01:14:38.038 --> 01:14:39.430
What'd you tell him?

1195
01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.432
- That he wasn't here and
I don't know where he is.

1196
01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.043
- All right. you did the right
thing.

1197
01:14:43.086 --> 01:14:44.392
Wait. there's more.

1198
01:14:44.435 --> 01:14:46.220
Before he left. he told
me that Mark has replaced

1199
01:14:46.263 --> 01:14:48.265
the chief of police and
now he's at the station

1200
01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:49.876
waiting for the boss to make a
move.

1201
01:14:51.181 --> 01:14:51.965
Understood.

1202
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.838
[phone beeping]

1203
01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:58.188
[knocking on door]

1204
01:14:58.232 --> 01:15:01.191
- Excuse me. sir. these two
children say that they saw

1205
01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:03.585
something and may be able to
help you.

1206
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:05.021
Oh. Hello. kids.

1207
01:15:05.979 --> 01:15:08.111
So. what did you see?

1208
01:15:08.155 --> 01:15:09.460
Mr. Mark?

1209
01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.071
Just Mark is fine.

1210
01:15:11.114 --> 01:15:12.072
We saw him.

1211
01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:14.117
Who did you see?

1212
01:15:14.161 --> 01:15:17.338
- The man who is always
with the Manuel guy.

1213
01:15:17.381 --> 01:15:21.124
- Oh. mean-looking guy. looks
like Mr. Clean. never smiles?

1214
01:15:21.168 --> 01:15:22.125
Yeah. that's him.

1215
01:15:23.605 --> 01:15:25.607
So. where was this?

1216
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:28.828
- We saw him at the old
abandoned hotel.

1217
01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:30.046
The one by the water?

1218
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:30.917
Yep.

1219
01:15:33.572 --> 01:15:35.748
You two kids did very well.

1220
01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:40.230
But listen. do not go
anywhere near there. okay?

1221
01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:42.885
And tell nobody. It's
very. very important.

1222
01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:43.712
- Okay.
- Okay.

1223
01:15:44.844 --> 01:15:46.715
All right. run along.

1224
01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:49.718
Thanks. Sergeant.

1225
01:15:53.156 --> 01:15:55.071
Awfully young for some CIs.

1226
01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.553
- Phil. what the hell are you
doing here?

1227
01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.599
- Not exactly a warm island
welcome.

1228
01:16:00.642 --> 01:16:02.601
It's nice to see you too.
partner.

1229
01:16:02.644 --> 01:16:05.255
This does not concern you.

1230
01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:07.475
Oh. it doesn't concern me.

1231
01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:12.132
Well. um. I have been
stashing potential witnesses

1232
01:16:12.175 --> 01:16:14.395
for you in safe houses
and running fingerprints

1233
01:16:14.438 --> 01:16:16.615
for your buddy Nate on a
Colombia sicario

1234
01:16:16.658 --> 01:16:18.442
working for the Cali Cartel.

1235
01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:20.183
But. sure. it doesn't concern
me.

1236
01:16:20.227 --> 01:16:22.055
I'm good. by the way.
Thank you. for not asking.

1237
01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:26.363
How's the girl?

1238
01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:29.279
- She's safe. Hence the word
safe house.

1239
01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:31.194
How's your buddy Nate?

1240
01:16:32.456 --> 01:16:34.502
Well he's been killed.

1241
01:16:34.545 --> 01:16:37.331
Hence. why I'm sitting at his
desk.

1242
01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:42.641
- Then I guess you need my
help more than I thought.

1243
01:16:42.684 --> 01:16:45.208
Come on. cut the bullshit.
man. Catch me up.

Come alone. Unarmed.

And bring Nora. I'll bring
Akilah.

I need to know she's alive.

to know you're still alive.

me! Kill the bastard!

This beach house you got me

Okay. Dad.

I'm embarrassed you think
it's gonna take me that long.

1278
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:22.148
- Well I'm accounting for
four minutes of your blabbing

1279
01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:24.411
and one minute of actual action.

1280
01:19:24.454 --> 01:19:25.629
- You know. this only works
if one of us is the funny one

1281
01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:27.762
and the other one's mean and
gruff. right?

1282
01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:30.678
- Hurry the fuck up and
save Akilah. Better?

1283
01:19:30.721 --> 01:19:33.072
I did miss you. Going dark.

as I know Akilah's safe.

1299

- You know. I don't think you're
really

1300
01:21:23.965 --> 01:21:25.662
in a position to negotiate here.

1301

Don't waste my fucking time.
