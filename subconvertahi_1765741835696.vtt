3
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
Ten million dollars
for the missile chip.

4
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.920
Not a plan...

5
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.000
...but the chip itself.

6
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440
Why the big price?

7
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.480
My clients have requested it.

8
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.480
I honor my clients' requests.

9
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.280
Sounds like your clients...

10
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.280
...want to build a missile
that can't be detected by radar.

11
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.120
I don't ask questions. Mr. Beaupre.

12
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.640
But whoever possesses this chip
could dominate the entire region.

13
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.360
- Good night. George.
- Good night. Mr. Cooper.

14
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880
- He's clean.
- Here.

15
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.480
That's what you asked for.

16
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.080
Air Force NSB-100. C series.

17
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.640
If that goes in a missile.
air defenses can't stop it.

18
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.400
Look. I got a plane to catch.

19
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.920
Where's my money?

20
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.880
Here.

21
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.920
Hide it in the toy car.

22
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.800
We'll slip it right past
airport security.

23
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.880
Let's go.

24
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640
<i>Welcome to San Francisco</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>

25
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.760
<i>Do not leave your bags unattended.</i>

26
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.360
Please remove your jewelry.

27
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.520
Let's go.

28
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.840
Ma'am. you have to wait.

29
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.960
Thank you.

30
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.520
Next. please.

31
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.280
Oh. my God.

32
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.720
Move. Move!

33
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.600
Young man!

34
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.360
The Dallas. Miami. New York
and Denver lounges. Nothing.

35
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.960
Bars. restaurants. club lounge. clean.

36
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.600
When I was in the john.
I didn't see anything in there.

37
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.840
It has to be on a plane.

38
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.280
We are going to Chicago.

39
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.200
In the winter?

40
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.040
I packed tropical.

41
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.600
<i>Welcome to Chicago.</i>
<i>where it's 29 degrees outside.</i>

42
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.920
Welcome to Chicago.

43
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.400
Bye-bye.

44
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.280
Here you go. sir.

45
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.400
Mr. Beaupre!

46
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.520
Mr. Unger. Mr. Jernigan.

47
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.360
Excuse me.

48
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.640
- Out of my way.
- Move.

49
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.960
- Did you check any bags. ma'am?
- No. Floor it!

50
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.600
She's leaving.

51
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.720
That's him.

52
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.200
Excuse me. pop.
Can I ask you something?

53
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
What?

54
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.520
You had a fare from the airport
around 1620 hours. January 8.

55
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.280
Senior citizen. female. Caucasian.

56
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.080
- What?
- About 4:30 today. Old broad.

57
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.520
- Oh. yeah.
- You got an address on that?

58
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.280
North Devon Park. Washington Street.

59
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.640
Describe the house. please.

60
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.400
Big. old...

61
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.480
<i>... Tudor-like place.</i>

62
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.920
- Details.
- Christmas lights. wreath on the door.

63
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.040
Christmas tree by the driveway.
and the driveway...

64
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.400
...was the only one
on the block not shoveled.

65
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.040
I'm done. Mrs. Hess.
I'm exhausted and sweaty...

66
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.640
...but you can't see
because I'm covered up.

67
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.520
You were to deal
with the snow promptly.

68
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.040
- Yes. but...
- "Buts" are for ashtrays.

69
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.440
I don't care for excuses. We had
an understanding and you broke it.

70
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.040
- Your word is worthless.
- Sorry. That'll be no charge.

71
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.920
So you can tell the neighbors
I stiffed you on a job?

72
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.320
Is this a loaf of the famous
San Francisco sourdough bread?

73
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.800
This won't make
a very tasty sandwich. will it?

74
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.440
Because of some silly.
inconsiderate boob who took my bag...

75
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.680
...I left my bread in San Francisco!

76
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.440
Pardon me. Mrs. Hess.
but I think I'm almost. maybe...

77
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.800
...possibly. probably
gonna be late for my dinner.

78
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.800
Consider this your payment.
I have no use for it.

79
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.320
Thank you.

80
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.520
And have your mother teach you...

81
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.160
...that it is rude to scratch
yourself in front of a lady.

82
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.440
Good night. Alex.

83
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.640
Jeez.

84
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.800
What a grouch.

85
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.040
They're all old...

86
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.520
...most of them are Tudor...

87
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.920
...all have wreaths
and Christmas trees...

88
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.520
...and the snow's all shoveled.

89
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.520
There are 14 houses.

90
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.040
The toy car must be in one of them.

91
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.400
We'll have to search them all.

92
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.560
- We'll come back when it's light.
- We're gonna work in daylight?

93
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.640
It's the suburbs. Mr. Unger.

94
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.040
Nobody's home during the day.

95
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.120
There you go. Speedy.

96
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.560
Charlie. I told you last year.
and I'm telling you now...

97
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.320
...I can't work weekends.

98
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.320
<i>- Why not?</i>
- I've got three kids and a husband.

99
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.760
That's Mary Lou. She has no life.

100
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.120
It means nothing to her
to work weekends. but I can't.

101
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.280
My house is half-renovated.
My kids have activities.

102
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.040
They need to see us doing more
than running to the car.

103
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.640
I can't explain over the phone why
we're so excited about this product.

104
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.160
I'll be in Cleveland on Wednesday.

105
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.920
Yeah. Wednesday. We'll talk
about it then. Face to face.

106
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Yeah. man to man.

107
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.000
Your brother's bug!

108
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.040
Careful! Careful!

109
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.520
Bull's-eye!

110
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.640
Three from downtown.

111
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.760
And the crowd goes wild.

112
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.240
Oh. man.

113
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.040
I hope they're not...

114
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.160
Alex slammed the seat
down on his thing again!

115
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.760
Bull's-eye.

116
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.040
Alex. what happened?

117
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.560
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm innocent!

118
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.160
I gotta go. My kid slammed
the seat on his thing again.

119
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.800
I'll call you back.

120
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.760
Alex?

121
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.280
Keep that in your mouth.

122
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.440
Chickenpox.

123
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.920
With all due respect...

124
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.800
...this is to get out of his science
project because his bug died.

125
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.920
What?

126
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.400
- His face doesn't look that bad.
- His body's covered.

127
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.800
- Would that include his buttocks?
- Shut up!

128
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.560
This is great. If he scratches
his spots. we can call him scar-butt.

129
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.240
- Leave.
- Goodbye.

130
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.800
- I'll make you some soup.
- I'll bring the TV up.

131
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.920
I'm so sorry.

132
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.040
Hey. Don't scratch.

133
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.760
Keep that under your tongue.
I'll be back.

134
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.320
Nice family. Huh. Doris?

135
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.800
- You guys should get going.
- See you later. Dad.

136
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.400
Greenfield's 401 k is in the Effa fund.

137
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.800
You have it in the Midcap fund.
That's where your 3000 shortfall is.

138
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.320
I have to put you on hold one sec.

139
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.640
Alex. I'm on with the office!

140
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.800
So I think that what we...

141
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.520
I'm sorry.
Can I call you back in a minute?

142
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.520
Gotcha.

143
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.520
You rang?

144
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.160
Thirsty?

145
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.640
Thanks. Mom.

146
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.240
- Here we are.
- I wish my husband could be here.

147
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.000
It's a cozy little place.

148
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.240
Isn't this charming!

149
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.160
And it's available immediately.

150
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.880
My boys are just gonna love it here.

151
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.520
Yes. they will.

If you think that was amusing.
wait till you see what I do next.

155
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.080
Oh. yeah.

156
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.000
- Sit!
- I can't wait for next week.

157
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.000
I hate dogs.

158
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.520
Charlie. you know I can't come in.
Alex is sick.

159

<i>Melling's reviewing the proposal.</i>

160
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.280
- You're kidding.
<i>- No.</i>

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.240

<i>- He's leaving Friday.</i>

162

<i>- We can't cancel.</i>
- It's okay.

163
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.840
- Mary Lou can handle it.
<i>- She's not who he expects to see.</i>

164
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.520
<i>You're the point person.</i>
<i>You told me you'd handle it.</i>

165
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.760
I did. but my child wasn't sick
when I promised you...

166
00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.240
<i>Not my fault you can't find a sitter.</i>

167
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.760
Okay. I can come in for one hour.
That is it.

168
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.080
If Alex beeps me. I'm gone
and you can fire me.

Thank you. Alex.

175
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.520
Yes. he knows you're sick.

176
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.800
What about the Family Leave Act?

177
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.800
I just have to go in...

178
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.320
...sign some papers and show my face.

179
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.240
I'll be gone an hour at the very most.

180
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.200
I called Mrs. Hess and...

181
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.360
You called Mrs. Hess?
She knows I'll be alone?

182
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.760
She said if anything comes up.
she'll be right over.

183
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.520
- She wasn't happy about it...
- She'll come over and make me smoke.

184
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.000
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What if there's a tornado?

185
00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.480
Not in winter.

186
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.040
- Social unrest?
- I don't think so.

187
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.680
Boredom? It's deadly in old folks.

188
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.680
Goodbye. sweetie.

189
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.600
What about crooks?

190
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.520
That's not a problem during the day.

191
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.000
Why not?
No one's home during the day.

192
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.320
I'm 8 and I figured that out.

193
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.440
Couldn't a grown-up crook
figure it out too?

194
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.600
This is a very safe neighborhood.
There's only one road in and out.

195
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.520
The doors'll be locked.
you have my numbers.

196
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.520
- I'll be home soon.
- But. Mom!

197
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.480
What about dragons. giant spiders.
mummies. the living dead...

198
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680
...and other figments
of my imagination?

199
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.840
Alex. I can't help you there.

200
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.880
Only you can control your imagination.

201
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.800
That's a scary thought.

202
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.800
That's weird.

203
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.720
Oh. my God.

204
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.080
20 seconds out.

205
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.200
Clear.

206
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.360
911 Emergency.

207
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.280
- I saw a burglar!
- Are you by yourself?

208
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.960
My mom had to leave.
I have the chickenpox.

209
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.760
Can I have your address?

210
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.440
He's not at my house!
He's at the Stephans'!

211
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.320
Their address is
3015 Washington Street!

212
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.520
Nothing.

213
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.840
Burglar at the Stephans'!
I saw him with my telescope!

214
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.280
There's a woman with a dog
and a gray van!

215
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.240
I didn't recognize anyone. but
the dog looked like Johnny Allen's...

216
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.000
...so I called the police.

217
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.040
You called the police?

218
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.040
Freeze!

219
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.840
The burglar alarm was on and working.

220
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.800
There was no one in the house.

221
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.280
Doesn't appear that
anything's been taken.

222
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.040
I don't know what he saw
but it wasn't a person.

223
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.760
I'm sorry about this.

224
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.080
My son's been home with chickenpox
and I had to run to work.

225
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.760
I'm strapped.
I don't normally do this.

226
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.120
Son. false alarms are
no joking matter.

227
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.480
It wasn't!

228
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.880
The guy in the house had two lookouts
and a driver in a gray van.

229
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.000
He's been running a fever.

230
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.960
Ours is a serious business.

231
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.800
Oh. he knows. We gave him
a police set for Christmas...

232
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.280
Not this one. but last. You know.
one with a badge. a hat and a whistle.

233
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.840
He took it very seriously. He
arrested relatives for various crimes.

234
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.200
Not real crimes. but for leaving
the toilet seat up and snoring and...

235
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.040
Absolutely.

236
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.880
I will. yes. Thank you.

237
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.440
Thank you.

238
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.600
You get in that bed.

239
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.600
Excuse me. I saw a man
in Karen Stephans' bedroom.

240
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.360
A white male a little older than Dad.
wearing butt inspection gloves.

241
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.120
I warned you about that telescope.

242
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.160
Look long enough and you'll see
things. whether or not they're there.

243
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.600
I guess you have to be 35
before anyone listens to you.

244
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.760
Don't get smart with me.
Sick or not. I'm very angry with you.

245
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.080
You caused a lot of trouble today.

246
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.520
We have to replace a door.
You think we're happy about it?

247
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.320
I saw what I saw.

248
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.480
Peter Beaupre...

249
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.800
...Earl Unger...

250
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.800
...Burton Jernigan...

251
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.280
...and Alice Rivens.

252
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.640
They were ticketed under aliases
but didn't board the Hong Kong flight.

253
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.800
I believe they're still in the U.S..
but beyond that. I don't know.

254
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.480
Ladies and gentlemen...

255
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.840
...we've got to find that chip.

256
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.320
<i>What went wrong</i>
<i>with the burglar alarm?</i>

257
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.320
- Nothing. It wasn't the alarm.
- Then who called the police?

258
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.160
Mr. Jernigan. care to speculate?

259
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.600
Cars came and went.
The mailman came by.

260
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.000
We could have a watcher on any house.
It could be anybody.

261
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.520
I don't think it's just anybody.
I think it's someone on our street.

262
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.840
Someone we are not tracking.

263
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.360
Someone we've missed.

264
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.840
Dad. cab's here.

265
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.280
Oh. shoot.

266
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.600
Mom's not back yet.

267
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.800
Well. all right.

268
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.840
Mom took some documents to the bank.

269
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.280
She can't be gone
more than a few minutes.

270
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.760
Mrs. Hess is home. You'll be fine.

271
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.680
My beeper's on speed dial.

272
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.600
- Second button. Mom's is the first.
- Right.

273
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.080
- So. you're okay?
- Positively.

274
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.040
Give me a kiss.

275
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.320
Dad.

276
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.600
This is a safe neighborhood.

277
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.840
We have great police.
as you learned yesterday.

278
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.080
Nothing bad will happen to you.

279
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.760
- Dad?
- Yeah?

280
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.280
- Got your tickets?
- Yep.

281
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.240
- Got your wallet?
- It's in my pocket.

282
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.080
Where's your pocket?

283
00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.360
Yeah.

284
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.400
- Thank you.
- Bye. Dad.

285
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.000
She's leaving.

286
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.640
3025 is all clear.

287
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.320
<i>Red sedan heading south.</i>

288
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.160
Turning right. Hold.

289
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.280
- You are just in time. Mr. Pruitt.
- Wait. wait.

290
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.240
Oh. no.

291
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.040
Yes.

292
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.840
Abort. Abort.

293
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.760
Evacuate the area.

294
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.400
Let's go!

295
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.120
Move! Move!

296
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.760
Cool!

297
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.000
Check the back.

298
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.880
Nothing.

299
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.800
Let's check upstairs.

300
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.160
Where's the burglar?

301
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.040
There is no burglar.

302
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.120
Just a kid home sick from school.
making false alarms.

303
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.880
How embarrassing.

304
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.120
This is the second time in two days
that you've called the police.

305
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.160
It's a very serious matter
when a person calls the police.

306
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.480
I saw a burglar yesterday.
and I saw one today.

307
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.000
Alex. listen to the chief.

308
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.160
- There was no one in that house.
- What about Johnny Allen's dog?

309
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.800
I talked to Johnny last night.
His dog was kidnapped Monday morning.

310
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.640
Did he see it happen?

311
00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.120
Alex. apologize to the chief
and go up to your room.

312
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.320
Excuse me for being a good citizen.

313
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.840
Alex! I'm very sorry.

314
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.640
This will not happen again.

315
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.840
Will it. honey?
Really. I promise you.

316
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.120
We wouldn't want to discourage him
from calling us...

317
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.600
...in the event that
something real ever does happen.

318
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.680
Loser.

319
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.040
- Shut up.
- Make me.

320
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.040
You pranked them twice.
It's on your permanent record.

321
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.560
For your whole life.
if you call for help. it won't come.

322
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.240
- Dad missed his plane.
- He was late to meet his boss.

323
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.760
We have to give family cash
to the Stephans...

324
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.280
...and to an evil octogenarian
to repair their doors.

325
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.560
And even worse...

326
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.320
The world laughs.

327
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.880
You've stained the family name.

328
00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.040
First the Stephans.

329
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.600
Then Mrs. Hess.

330
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.880
I agree. Doris.
The next stop is the Alcotts' house.

331
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.400
What burglar goes into a house
and doesn't take anything?

332
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.440
You know what I think?
They're looking for something special.

333
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.200
And they're looking in every house
because they don't know who has it.

334
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.600
The question is...

335
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.440
...what is it?

336
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.400
If nobody's gonna
do anything about this...

337
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.640
...I'll just have to do it myself.

338
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.080
I am so sorry.
I'm clearly not awake.

339
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.080
It's all right.

340
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.280
Have a nice day.

341
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.440
I'll try.

342
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.200
Watch this.

343
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.800
Look. Doris.

344
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.600
I forgot about the stairs.

345
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.080
Got him. Doris. Got him.

346
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.200
Yes. yes. yes!

347
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.440
You are so busted.

348
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.400
I have it.

349
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.920
The toy car. It's videotaping me.

350
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.080
Come back on that.

351
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.080
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

352
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.360
Don't spin!

353
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.440
<i>You there!</i>

354
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.080
<i>You was friendly.</i>
<i>I don't have to kill you.</i>

355
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.560
<i>You got money that</i>
<i>doesn't belong to you.</i>

356
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.800
Hello. this is Karen.
Hi. how's it going?

357
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.120
<i>I'm running late</i>
<i>for the office again.</i>

358
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.600
<i>I think blue chips</i>
<i>are overvalued.</i>

359
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.720
<i>Technology stocks are good.</i>

360
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.600
<i>I'm in the shower.</i>
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

361
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.720
<i>Bad. bad Leroy Brown</i>

362
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.440
<i>Baddest cat in the whole damn town</i>

363
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.600
<i>Badder than old King Kong</i>

364
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.080
<i>Meaner than a junkyard dog</i>

365
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.400
Come on. come on.

366
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.600
See you!

367
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.040
The car's outside.
I got the woman here. Get over here!

368
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.320
Come on. get up!

369
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.880
Everybody's in a hurry.

370
00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.000
It's a camera.
Someone's onto us.

371
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.680
Think it matters? Chip's in the car.
We're at the airport in 45 minutes.

372
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.800
Where is Alice?

373
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.040
What happened?

374
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.040
There is a woman in the house.
I'll deal with her.

375
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.680
Get the chip.

376
00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.200
I got it.

377
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.320
Ma'am?

378
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.800
May I have a word with you?

379
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.200
Don't come in. I'm naked.

380
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.200
<i>What's on your mind. monkey butt?</i>

381
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.520
Come on.

382
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.040
<i>What's that funky smell?</i>

383
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.040
I lost it.

384
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.520
What?!

385
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.040
Come on. go. go. go!

386
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520
It's out of range!

387
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.000
I got it.

388
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.680
I see it.

389
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.200
Look out.

390
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.200
Jernigan. which direction?

391
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.960
It got past me.
It's heading south on Adams.

392
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.400
I'm right behind the little...

393
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.160
It's off the street.
going through back yards...

394
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.160
...heading west.

395
00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.120
Alice. what's your position?

396
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.560
Fourth house. Moving to the alley.

397
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.880
It's going through the hedge.

398
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.640
Jernigan. position.

399
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.840
You're there.

400
00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.680
- I got it!
- I got it!

401
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.680
Unger. What's your position?

402
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.240
Heading down Washington Street.

403
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.640
I didn't copy. Where?

404
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.400
I said. I'm heading to Wa...

405
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.120
Stop. you nitwit!

406
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.080
I don't see anything.

407
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.600
I'll look around.

408
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.160
I don't have it yet.

409
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.560
We're out of time. Give it up.

410
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.880
They got the tape.
Why'd they still chase the toy car?

411
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.480
It's not that expensive.

412
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.680
I'm sure they don't have
enough time to play with it.

413
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.800
Look. Doris.

414
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.480
Computer chip. huh?
Where'd you find it?

415
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.680
In a remote-control car I got
for shoveling snow for Mrs. Hess.

416
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.680
She lives across the street.

417
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.320
It says U.S. Air Force...

418
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.680
...but you have to look
under a magnifying glass to see.

419
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.120
Kid. a lot of toys have
"Air Force" written on it.

420
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.560
This is a recruiting office.
We don't handle this.

421
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.640
Can I give you the chip number
to give to the right guys?

422
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.480
You think we should tell Mom
about the chip?

423
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.840
I guess you're right.
The less they know. the better.

424
00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.160
Those guys are bad news.

425
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.560
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you hitting me with the van.

426
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.320
Never let emotions
get the best of you.

427
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.120
You should have been more vigilant.

428
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.720
You should have taken driver's ed.

429
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.800
It's a kid. It has to be a kid.

430
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:20.080
I'm gonna have bad knees when I'm old.
I'll have Jernigan to thank.

431
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.560
The cops come.
they don't believe him...

432
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.760
...he takes matters
into his own hands.

433
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.640
It can't be anything else.

434
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.080
If that's the case.
I say take no chances.

435
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.680
Tomorrow. whack every kid
in the neighborhood. Burn them.

436
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.760
Then look for that stupid car.

437
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.640
My thoughts keep turning
to number 3026.

438
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.760
It's within the operating radius
of the toy car.

439
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.480
It's in sight of all the houses.

440
00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.760
- Hello?
<i>- Do you have the missile chip?</i>

441
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.160
We are close.

442
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.120
If I don't have the chip
in 24 hours. Mr. Beaupre...

443
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.760
...I will have
to terminate the mission...

444
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.520
...and nullify all the participants.

445
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.200
You understand. don't you?

446
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960
Dad's home tomorrow.

447
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.000
I have my meeting from 12 till 5.
so I need you and Molly...

448
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.960
...to come straight home
to stay with Alex.

449
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.080
I can't. Impossible.
I have gymnastics.

450
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.400
- I have hockey.
- Do I need to repeat myself?

451
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.960
I thought you were getting Mrs. Hess.

452
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.000
She's a lot more responsible
than me and Stan.

453
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.240
Mrs. Hess is a backup.

454
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.640
Unless it's an emergency.
I don't want to call her.

455
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.280
I'll be fine alone.

456
00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.720
There you have it. Settled.

457
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.320
Could you pass me the false alarms?

458
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.480
Sorry. I meant the peas.

459
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.760
Hello?

460
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.880
He's been home with the chickenpox.

461
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.120
Alex. do you know a Bradley Clovis?

462
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.440
Yeah.

463
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.480
It's his mom.
Did you take a toy car from him?

464
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.320
He has one of those cars.
but he got it from a neighbor.

465
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.000
We have it.

466
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.160
What is the matter?
You don't disconnect my calls.

467
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.280
Don't talk to her.

468
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.520
- Why not?
- She's dangerous.

469
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.640
- What are you talking about?
- Lies.

470
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.640
They're all lies. It wasn't her.

471
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.840
What do you mean. it wasn't her?

472
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.880
Call her. you'll be surprised.

473
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.120
Outgoing call.

474
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.120
Rerouted.

475
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.400
Hello. Clovis'.

476
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.920
- I beg your pardon. We just...
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

477
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.680
Did I disconnect you. Karen?

478
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.280
No. it was me. We're renovating.
the phone lines are a mess.

479
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.040
They intercepted the phone call.

480
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.320
Listen. I didn't mean
to accuse your son.

481
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.400
I'm certain Bradley
just misplaced his toy car.

482
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.000
Kids. They lose something
and assume it's been stolen.

483
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.920
Little boys do have
wild imaginations. don't they?

484
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.080
Yes. they do.

485
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.600
They're gonna come after me tomorrow.
Doris. Nobody will listen.

486
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.480
Not my parents or Molly or Stan...

487
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.400
...or the police
or the Air Force. Nobody.

488
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.520
So. what do I do?

489
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.800
If that means hide. you're wrong.

490
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.200
If that means fight. you're right.

491
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.920
They'll understand when I'm done.
and know I was telling the truth.

492
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.520
I'm not gonna feel sad or scared.

493
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.600
They're grown-up criminals...

494
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.320
...but this is my neighborhood
and this is my house.

495
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.960
No matter how old they are.
no matter how big they are...

496
00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.960
...they can't beat me here.
They can't beat me at home.

497
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.320
Want to buy a little silence?
Double or nothing.

498
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.200
<i>We're watching a major storm</i>
<i>bearing down on Chicago.</i>

499
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.000
<i>On the radar. you can see</i>
<i>the snow is increasing in intensity.</i>

500
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.640
<i>Heavy snow is forecasted.</i>

501
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.320
<i>Residents are urged</i>
<i>to stay indoors if possible.</i>

502
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.480
Approaching target.

503
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.680
All clear.

504
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.960
Here we go. Doris.

505
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.480
First. we free the hostages.

506
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.280
<i>Switching on the fiber optics.</i>

507
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.280
Alex. can you get the door?

508
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.640
No answer.

509
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.080
Are we certain target has not left?

510
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.160
We would've seen.

511
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.400
I repeat. there is no movement inside.

512
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.120
Permission to enter.

513
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.200
Alice?

514
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.600
Hey. Go home. Go home.

515
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.840
<i>I need assistance. I'm exposed.</i>

516
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.360
Maintain your position.

517
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.680
<i>Do not. I repeat. do not</i>
<i>draw attention to yourself.</i>

518
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.320
Pick her up.

519
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:14.360
We'll move in after the storm hits.
let Mother Nature cover our tracks.

520
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.040
This just came in from the Air Force.

521
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.880
Some kid named Pruitt called
the recruiting office in Chicago.

522
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.080
Said he found a computer chip
in a toy car.

523
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.960
We're going to Chicago.

524
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.280
Did you watch the weather?

525
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.800
- No problems. Your coat's there.
- I want to wear my brown one.

526
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.320
Wait!

527
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:44.160
Go fill your commuter cup with coffee
and I'll get your coat for you.

528
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.200
Thanks. hon.

529
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.480
I'll make you a sandwich.

530
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.280
- Here's your coat.
- Thanks.

531
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.480
Sweetheart. I'm sorry about this week.

532
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.640
It breaks my heart to have to come
and go. It shouldn't be this way.

533
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.160
It's okay. It's not you.
It's the times.

534
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.920
Thanks. hon.

535
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.920
You have your beeper?

536
00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.880
Great. I'll call every half-hour.

537
00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.000
I'll go online and keep
the connection open all day.

538
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.360
I'll have my laptop
in all my meetings.

539
00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.440
We'll be in contact at all times.

540
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.160
I have my cellular.
You've got my fax number.

541
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.000
We're wired.

542
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.200
Oh. my gosh. Did Mrs. Clovis call?

543
00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.960
She was gonna stop by to confirm
that Bradley's name wasn't on the car.

544
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:51.480
She did when you were in the shower.

545
00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.440
- You let her have it?
- Bigtime.

546
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.200
- I hope she felt foolish.
- It was painful.

547
00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.800
Okay. Be good.

548
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.800
Be safe.
Keep an eye on the old place.

549
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.800
I got it all covered.

550
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.200
Here we go.

551
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.880
It's just you and me.

552
01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.560
You mean there's someone else?

553
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.800
Get ready to rumble!
Play ball!

554
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.120
The old switcheroo.

555
01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.880
- Come on.
- It's showtime!

556
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.280
If those are real. I'm an eagle.

557
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.760
Block the street.

558
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.800
- Hello.
<i>- Hi. it's Karen Pruitt.</i>

559
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.880
<i>Could you check on Alex?</i>

560
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.960
I'm just going out.

561
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.200
<i>I'm at work and in a bind.</i>

562
01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.560
Well. how long?

563
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.440
<i>It wouldn't be for more than an hour.</i>

564
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.640
All right. No cooking.

565
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.240
"Call Mrs. Hess.

566
01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.960
She's retired. what else
could she possibly be doing?"

567
01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.640
Would they invite me to their house
for holiday eggnog? Of course not!

568
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.720
Look who woke up from her nap.

569
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.600
Crooks at 30 yards and closing.

570
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.960
Let the party begin.

571
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.080
Good afternoon.
We just moved into your neighborhood.

572
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.960
What do you want. a button?

573
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.280
A package was to be delivered to us.
but perhaps they brought it here.

574
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.800
Nope. not here.

575
01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.640
They said no one answered the door
and the driver left it in the garage.

576
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.360
Sometimes they leave stuff
at the back door.

577
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.800
Why are you closing the door?

578
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.800
I left my heart in San Francisco.

579
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.120
It looks like he has the place
locked up pretty tight.

580
01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.960
Jernigan. I think
I'm going to enjoy this.

581
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.280
It's been a long time
since I was a kid.

582
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.880
You forget how
incredibly stupid they are.

583
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.440
You be careful.

584
01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.680
When kids get scared.
they wet their pants.

585
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.720
Mr. Unger?

586
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.120
I'm all right.

587
01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.320
Mr. Unger. what are you doing?

588
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.160
Don't touch the yarn. It's wired.

589
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.840
Kid's got the place booby-trapped.

590
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.560
Make no assumptions.

591
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.320
Watch the mat.

592
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.600
This boy is clever.
Have you tried the door?

593
01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.120
Not yet.

594
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.920
Let me point something out to you.

595
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.200
Missed that.

596
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.960
Stand clear.

597
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.720
Maybe he's not so clever.

598
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.400
I think we're just having an off day.

599
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.320
A thought for you to consider:

600
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.720
At airport security...

601
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.320
...make sure you have
the right package.

602
01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.280
I certainly hope that you're not...

603
01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.160
...fond of that little boy
across the street.

604
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.120
I'll leave this open.

605
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.720
Fresh air will be good for you.

606
01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.480
Think you're smart?
You little brat!

607
01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.640
Unger. what's your status?

608
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.840
Heads up.

609
01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.600
- How'd that happen?
- I don't know.

610
01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.720
Ouch.

611
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.480
You got hit with a book?

612
01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.080
Books. Plural.

613
01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.240
A trunk full of books...

614
01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.880
...then a set of weights.
I got hit twice. you dumb broad.

615
01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.040
Excuse me. Mr. Unger.
I didn't get taken down by an infant.

616
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.720
We didn't anticipate the defense.

617
01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.880
I'll go in the front.

618
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.480
Mr. Unger. you take the north side.

619
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.160
Alice. you take the south side.

620
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.040
Where is Mr. Jernigan?

621
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.320
<i>Attention. travelers.</i>

622
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.880
<i>All flights to Chicago continue</i>
<i>to be delayed due to severe weather.</i>

623
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.640
<i>Please stand by for further details.</i>

624
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.160
You can run
but you can't hide. junior.

625
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.720
Surprise.

626
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.680
What a loser.

627
01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.160
I got him!

628
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.720
You are dead. kid.

629
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.600
Now things are looking up.

630
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.880
Gotcha!

631
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.440
See you.

632
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.720
Well. well. well.

633
01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.680
Nice try. kid.

634
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.560
Alice?

635
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.600
I'm coming down.

636
01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.840
Mr. Jernigan! Mr. Unger!

637
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.280
Welcome.

638
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.280
You got a haircut?

639
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.880
Are you almost done in there?

640
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.040
Don't start with me.

641
01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.440
I'll wait.

642
01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.560
Let's move.

643
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.160
- What stinks?
- Shut up.

644
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.440
Hello?

645
01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.480
<i>You're out of breath.</i>
<i>Something wrong?</i>

646
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.040
No. everything's fine.

647
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.680
I'm so worried.
The weather is terrible.

648
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.080
I'm coming home now.

649
01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.120
No. no. take your time. really.
Don't come home. Mom.

650
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.480
Pick up Stan and Molly from school.

651
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.880
<i>Are you sure?</i>

652
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.240
<i>Yeah. I'm playing Chinese checkers</i>
<i>with Mrs. Hess.</i>

653
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.640
<i>You're not smoking?</i>

654
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.480
No. I gotta go. Mrs. Hess gets
nutty when you make her wait.

655
01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.120
Okay. play fair.

656
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.480
Always.

657
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.040
What a brave little fellow.

658
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520
Mr. Jernigan.

659
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.160
- Living room clear.
- Good.

660
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.080
Nothing in the kitchen.

661
01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.280
Mr. Jernigan. follow me. Slowly.

662
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.280
Go. Doris.

663
01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.920
Mr. Unger. go ahead.

664
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.280
Cover him. I'll cover the stairs.

665
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.240
I'm coming for you. shorty.
to pay you back...

666
01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.280
...for all the misery you caused me.

667
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.280
What are you doing?

668
01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.720
Kid's in the closet.

669
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.160
Scaring him a little.
just before I grab him.

670
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.600
And behind door number one!

671
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.280
Towels.

672
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.240
I saw this door close.

673
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.840
Idiot!

674
01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.560
Would I make it up?

675
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.760
Why? What's the point?
We working on commission here?

676
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.120
What's going on?

677
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.440
- Mrs. Pruitt from Washington Street?
- Yes?

678
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.080
Agent Stuckey. FBI.

679
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.760
I came to talk to your son.

680
01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.760
You called about a computer chip
in a remote-control car?

681
01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.160
No.

682
01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.920
Oh. God. It's Alex.
It's my other son. What's happened?

683
01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.480
He may be in danger.

684
01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.720
He's not here. He's at home.

685
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.240
Let's move.

686
01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.320
Why is he in danger?

687
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.600
She asked you a question. sir.

688
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.160
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

689
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.800
The "it" you're referring to
is my little brother.

690
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.560
He intercepted
a top-secret electronic device...

691
01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.800
...stolen from
a Defense Dept. Contractor...

692
01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.480
...by criminals working for
a North Korean terrorist organization.

693
01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.440
Mr. Jernigan. come here.

694
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.440
<i>Green-eyed lady. ocean lady</i>

695
01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.440
<i>Moving every breaking wave that comes</i>

696
01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.160
Go. Doris. go!

697
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.360
<i>Green-eyed lady. ocean lady</i>

698
01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:45.440
<i>Moving every breaking wave that comes</i>

699
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.920
<i>Green-eyed lady. lovely lady</i>

700
01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:53.080
<i>Strolling slowly towards the sun</i>

701
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.160
Sorry. Charlie.

702
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.600
This just ain't your day.

703
01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.320
Shut up.

704
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.480
- What?
- Don't move.

705
01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.920
Don't...

706
01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.440
...move.

707
01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.280
What?

708
01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.320
Excellent.

709
01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.640
Run. shorty. run!

710
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920
Come on. Doris.

711
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.560
The kid!

712
01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.360
Doris. come on!

713
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.920
You little brat!

714
01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.000
I got him!

715
01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.960
You smacked my winkie.

716
01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.840
If you changed your shorts. maybe
you wouldn't have rats in your pants!

717
01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.760
Scraggy little rug rat!

718
01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.480
Where is he?

719
01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.840
Stay here. Doris.

720
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.640
Yikes.

721
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.920
He's been watching us the whole time.
He had a camera on us.

722
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.960
You won't find me up there. you
big. dumb. law-breaking knuckleheads!

723
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.800
He's outside.

724
01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.160
Recognize this?

725
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.800
How'd he get outside?

726
01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.840
The same way you will.

727
01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:38.960
Jump! Go!

728
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.000
Don't push.

729
01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.560
You're jumping onto a trampoline.

730
01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.600
I presume you won't be joining us?

731
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.440
- No. I'll be covering you. Go!
- How comforting.

732
01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.280
He's getting away!

733
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.160
This is a snap.

734
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.280
This is a snap.

735
01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.400
Go!

736
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.600
Cold. Very cold.

737
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.440
Of course.

738
01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.160
Here I come. you little brat.

739
01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.240
Ouch.

740
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.040
Mrs. Hess!

741
01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.160
Mrs. Hess.

742
01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.000
You're okay. I'm here now.

743
01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.600
Well...

744
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.560
...it's Alex. isn't it?

745
01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.840
Today you learn something.

746
01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.400
There is a price to be paid
for being a good citizen.

747
01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:15.720
In your zeal to aid your neighbor.
you stepped into one of my traps.

748
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.040
Can Mrs. Hess go inside?
She's very old and very cold.

749
01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.280
Please?

750
01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.520
Give me the chip.

751
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.000
It doesn't belong to you.
It's not yours.

752
01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:00.520
The chip. son.
Give me the chip.

753
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
- That doesn't belong to you either.
- What?

754
01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.000
That's not your gun.

755
01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.760
This is your gun.

756
01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.560
Gotcha!

757
01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.720
- Here. sit down. Mrs. Hess.
- Thank you. Alex.

758
01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.640
These are times that call for soup.
Any favorites?

759
01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.120
Thank you. I'm fine.

760
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.960
You know. Mrs. Hess...

761
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.440
...it's really cold outside.
You're a pretty tough old bird.

762
01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.000
And you're a very sweet young man.

763
01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.240
I just never took the time to notice.

764
01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.840
You're not alone in that.

765
01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.520
Johnson. Williams. Go around back.

766
01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.560
Freeze!

767
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.240
You gotta be kidding.

768
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.720
Alex.

769
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.760
Mom!

770
01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.400
You're hugging and kissing me
in front of the cops.

771
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.720
I'm so sorry.

772
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.520
I'm so sorry
I didn't listen to you.

773
01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:51.440
This is very cool.

774
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.480
Bud. you're a hero.

775
01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.320
- Are you Alex?
- Yeah.

776
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.360
Agent Stuckey. FBI.

777
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.160
Here's the chip.

778
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.920
There's a senior citizen
across the street...

779
01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.000
...who needs some soup
and a doctor to look at her feet.

780
01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.920
There's two in our pool
and one in our basement.

781
01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.160
The other one's gone.

782
01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.120
Is this him?

783
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.560
Yep.

784
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.720
Seven years. I've been after this guy.

785
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.120
He always manages to slip away.

786
01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.360
Thanks.

787
01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.720
- It's just the three.
- Where's your boss?

788
01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.400
- Get them out of here!
- Yes. sir. Let's go. popsicle.

789
01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.040
Come on.

790
01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:05.720
Lucy. I'm home!

791
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.600
What's on your mind. monkey butt?

792
01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.240
<i>Bad. bad. Leroy Brown</i>

793
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.840
Houston. we have a problem.

794
01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.560
Counting down in...

795
01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:32.440
...five. four. three. two...

796
01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.720
Take it.

797
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.320
Double or nothing.

798
01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.920
I only have one.

799
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.320
We have ignition.

800
01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.840
It's showtime!

801
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.960
I'll be there in just a minute.
Okay. bye.

802
01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.440
It's the Tudor with the Christmas
lights in the driveway...

803
01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600
...that hasn't been shoveled.

804
01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.280
That one. right there.

805
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.080
Have you ever had the chickenpox?

806
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.240
I had the chickenpox when
Herbert Hoover was in the White House.

807
01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.120
Hello.

808
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.720
Dad!

809
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.160
Hey. come here.

810
01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.960
Let's see. You don't look
any worse for the wear.

811
01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.600
They couldn't touch me.

812
01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.320
The computer company with the boosted
chip is giving Alex a reward.

813
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.320
It's a six-figure sum.
which is extremely cool.

814
01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.720
So did you bring me anything?

815
01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.480
As a matter of fact. I did.

816
01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.560
Come here.

817
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.480
Think you can drive that?

818
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.000
I think we can handle it.

819
01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.960
Gentlemen. start your engines.

820
01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.800
360! 360!

821
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.760
Rat overboard!

822
01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.360
Say cheese.

823
