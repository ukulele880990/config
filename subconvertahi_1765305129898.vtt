00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:41.276
[Latin guitar music playing]

4
00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:47.073
[male narrator] Nowadays. the US
government can listen to anything you say.

5
00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.493
They know where you are.
they know who you're talking to.

6
00:00:50.576 --> 00:00:53.955
and trust me.
they know who you're fucking.

7
00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.792
You turn on a cell phone or a computer.
and you're doomed.

8
00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:03.006
But in Colombia in 1989.
it wasn't that easy.

9
00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.300
First off.
there was no Internet.

10
00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:06.801
No cells.

11
00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:08.553
The best they had were satellite phones.

12
00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:12.891
and in order to capture a satellite phone.
you had to fly directly over it.

13
00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:17.270
On top of that. the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

14
00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:19.731
the landowners. the politicians...

15
00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:24.819
And lucky for us.
the narcos were richer than them all.

16
00:01:24.903 --> 00:01:27.655
[phone squeaking]

17
00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:30.575
[man speaking Spanish]
What's up. Lizard?

18
00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:33.953
We're going out tonight.

19
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.294
[narrator] And once you got a signal.
you didn't know who you were listening to.

20
00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:44.964
That's why back then. the US government
developed software that could identify

21
00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:47.508
- the voices of our targets.
- [indistinct chatter on headphones]

22
00:01:47.592 --> 00:01:51.721
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz.
gentlemen.

23
00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:54.849
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

24
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.310
Hammer. prepare to engage.

25
00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.813
[narrator] Once we got a target.
we still had to locate it.

26
00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:04.650
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

27
00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:07.070
[chatter in Spanish over headphones]

28
00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:10.407
OK. he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

29
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.658
Hawkeye. how do you copy that?

30
00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:16.288
[man over radio] Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

31
00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:18.539
[in Spanish]
La Dispensaria.

32
00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.209
I've got a table ready.

33
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.837
Show up around midnight.

34
00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:27.966
- It's gonna be raining women.
- [narrator] Poison didn't know it.

35
00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.260
but he'd just made himself a date.

36
00:02:30.343 --> 00:02:34.264
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

37
00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.224
Hammer. disengage.

38
00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:38.601
So who do we give this to? DEA?

39
00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:42.188
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

40
00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:44.357
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

41
00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.734
[baby crying]

42
00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:48.820
[narrator]
By "the other guy." he meant me.

43
00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:52.073
I'm Steve Murphy.
Drug Enforcement Agent.

44
00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:56.702
And as you can see.
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

45
00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:57.829
Hello?

46
00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.373
[man] Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

47
00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:01.291
Got it.

48
00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:04.002
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

49
00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.420
OK.

50
00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:08.089
[Steve] I would've loved
to go after Poison myself.

51
00:03:08.173 --> 00:03:11.510
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

52
00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:15.596
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

53
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.848
Hola.

54
00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:20.601
- [up-tempo Latin music playing]
- [in Spanish] La Dispensaria?

55
00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:21.727
All right.

56
00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:25.731
Guess who that was.

57
00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:28.067
Your partner.

58
00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:30.862
He just gave me a great gift.

59
00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:33.323
Poison.

60
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.413
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

61
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.665
Yeah. sure.

62
00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:44.876
He's not a fool.

63
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.170
Gotta go.

64
00:03:48.588 --> 00:03:51.257
Gonna stick me with the bill?

65
00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:57.805
Cheap son of a bitch.

66
00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.517
[Steve] In case you're wondering.
this is the asshole.

67
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.478
Javier Peña. my partner.

68
00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:07.065
And this is Colonel Carrillo.
the leader of the Search Bloc.

69
00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:10.109
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

70
00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.987
Boy. did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

71
00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:16.282
- [motorcycles rumbling]
- [up-tempo Latin music playing]

72
00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:20.786
[Steve] Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

73
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.705
Especially the local hitmen.

74
00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:24.541
Colombians call them sicarios.

75
00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:27.377
- [in Spanish] What's up. son?
- Hey. brother.

76
00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:30.880
- Let's go inside and have a good time.
- [horn honks]

77
00:04:30.963 --> 00:04:32.965
[Steve]
Now. Poison. he was one of the best.

78
00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:36.969
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

79
00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:38.513
Probably hundreds.

80
00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.390
But don't get me wrong.

81
00:04:40.473 --> 00:04:43.726
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

82
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.313
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

83
00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:55.780
[in Spanish]
It's on. boys!

84
00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:59.117
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

85
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.245
Riano. Trujillo.
you're in the front with me.

86
00:05:02.328 --> 00:05:04.539
- Galvis and Silva. you take up the rear.
- Yes. sir.

87
00:05:04.623 --> 00:05:07.125
You got it. boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

88
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:10.002
We're gonna kill these fuckers.
all right?

89
00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.504
[all]
Yes. sir!

90
00:05:12.338 --> 00:05:14.757
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

91
00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:19.304
[men calling out in Spanish]

92
00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:26.603
[Steve] I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

93
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.648
[music playing loudly]

94
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.983
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

95
00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:34.026
[Steve]
Yeah. I pushed the buttons.

96
00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:42.785
- [overlapping gunfire]
- [screaming]

97
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.541
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

98
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.211
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

99
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.717
My fellow Americans...

100
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.135
[Steve]
Take Richard Nixon. for instance.

101
00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.306
People forget.
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

102
00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:30.309
We thought he was one of the good guys.

103
00:07:30.518 --> 00:07:33.605
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

104
00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.398
because he hated the commies.

105
00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:38.067
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

106
00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:40.612
[sirens wailing]

107
00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:46.284
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

108
00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:52.039
- [crowd chanting in Spanish]
- Maybe not such a good guy after all.

109
00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:01.591
But sometimes.
bad guys do good things.

110
00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:08.055
Nobody knows this. but back in '73.
Chile was on its way

111
00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:12.059
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

112
00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:17.022
[in Spanish] How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

113
00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:20.652
[Steve] They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

114
00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:21.861
to ship the product north.

115
00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:25.615
To be productive.
you can't waste money! Come on!

116
00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:26.907
[chatter in Spanish]

117
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:28.701
[man 1 shouts]
You're surrounded!

118
00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:31.203
- [man 2] Hands up!
- [man 1] Everybody on your knees!

119
00:08:31.287 --> 00:08:32.831
[Steve]
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

120
00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:34.791
- What the fuck is going on here?
- [weapons cocking]

121
00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:35.875
On the ground!

122
00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.212
[Steve] He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

123
00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:46.344
And then. being Pinochet...

124
00:08:48.012 --> 00:08:49.430
he had them all killed.

125
00:08:49.514 --> 00:08:52.141
- [man 1 shouts in Spanish] Attention!
- [boots stomp in unison]

126
00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:54.769
- Weapons ready!
- [weapons rattle]

127
00:08:54.853 --> 00:08:56.270
Aim!

128
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.272
Ready ammunition!

129
00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:01.233
[man 2]
Fire!

130
00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:10.535
[man grunting]

131
00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:14.246
[Steve] They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world.

132
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.250
- only the cockroaches will survive.
- [panting]

133
00:09:18.334 --> 00:09:20.044
I guess they were right.

134
00:09:21.504 --> 00:09:23.214
[groaning]

135
00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:27.301
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno.
aka Cockroach.

136
00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:29.637
and he was smart enough to play dead.

137
00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:34.851
He wasn't killed on that day.

138
00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:40.272
Instead. he won the damn lottery.

139
00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:47.363
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

140
00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:50.783
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

141
00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:54.370
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

142
00:09:54.453 --> 00:09:57.832
[in Spanish] Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

143
00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:00.793
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

144
00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:06.340
- But you're not a communist.
- No. not a communist. something worse.

145
00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:08.760
A drug trafficker.

146
00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:12.096
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes. a drug trafficker.

147
00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:18.603
[Steve] Back then. we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

148
00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:21.522
- on the human brain.
- [button clicking]

149
00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:24.859
We didn't know much. but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

150
00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:27.278
...this will give us better results. OK?

151
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:30.573
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

152
00:10:30.656 --> 00:10:33.868
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

153
00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:39.791
It would choose cocaine over sleep.
over sex... over life itself.

154
00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:43.002
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

155
00:10:45.004 --> 00:10:47.256
unless we're talking about cocaine.

156
00:10:53.554 --> 00:10:55.723
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

157
00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:59.059
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

158
00:10:59.143 --> 00:11:00.519
[Cockroach] Gracias.

159
00:11:02.563 --> 00:11:05.274
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

160
00:11:05.357 --> 00:11:06.484
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

161
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:08.987
[cheers and applause]

162
00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:12.698
Like Goldilocks.
he had three options.

163
00:11:12.782 --> 00:11:16.035
And pay attention. because all three
are important to this story.

164
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.918
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge. that's Fabio on the horse.

165
00:11:24.002 --> 00:11:27.713
- A typical Colombian smuggling family.
- [chatter in Spanish]

166
00:11:27.797 --> 00:11:30.215
- They were smart and rich...
- [shouts] Salud!

167
00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:33.469
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

168
00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:38.307
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha.

169
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.186
nicknamed "The Mexican."
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

170
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:45.064
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

171
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:48.818
- [up-tempo Latin music plays]
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

172
00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:55.533
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade.
even by Colombian standards.

173
00:11:55.616 --> 00:11:57.117
If you make it to the top...

174
00:11:58.577 --> 00:12:01.580
- it means you've killed your enemies.
- [people screaming]

175
00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:05.710
[in Spanish]
Hey. partner. What are you doing here?

176
00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:07.545
[Steve]
And sometimes. your partners.

177
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.387
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

178
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:25.021
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

179
00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:27.857
[in Spanish]

180
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.111
[Steve]
Yeah. you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

181
00:12:32.194 --> 00:12:34.530
The man who would
change my life forever.

182
00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:39.744
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

183
00:12:39.827 --> 00:12:42.287
Cigarettes. alcohol. marijuana.
you name it.

184
00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:47.167
At the time.
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

185
00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:51.756
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

186
00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:55.051
They didn't play by the same rules.

187
00:12:56.594 --> 00:12:57.929
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
Good day.

188
00:12:58.679 --> 00:12:59.972
Pablo Escobar?

189
00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:01.473
Where's Felipo?

190
00:13:01.682 --> 00:13:03.601
Felipo's been arrested.

191
00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:05.477
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

192
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:08.564
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

193
00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:11.067
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

194
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.277
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax. Gustavo. please.

195
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.946
Show some respect.

196
00:13:17.115 --> 00:13:19.366
Now what's the problem.
Mr. Jose Luis?

197
00:13:21.827 --> 00:13:23.454
How do you know my name?

198
00:13:23.662 --> 00:13:25.706
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

199
00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:30.419
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

200
00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:37.468
There's Garcia. Lopez...

201
00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:39.595
- Is that Pinilla?
- [Gustavo] Yes. Pinilla.

202
00:13:39.678 --> 00:13:40.805
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

203
00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:42.389
Pinilla...

204
00:13:42.473 --> 00:13:44.308
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

205
00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:46.477
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

206
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.104
I don't have all day.

207
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:53.901
Open it.

208
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.326
[Herrera chuckles]

209
00:14:03.327 --> 00:14:04.954
Tell me something. Mr. Escobar.

210
00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:07.748
Who the fuck do you think you are?

211
00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:11.251
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

212
00:14:11.335 --> 00:14:13.129
Because I pay for the privilege. Colonel.

213
00:14:13.212 --> 00:14:14.922
Oh. yeah? You don't say.

214
00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:16.799
Where are your import papers?

215
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.136
You need papers for these TV sets.

216
00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:21.637
Take them.

217
00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:23.263
[chuckles]

218
00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:28.435
Sorry. Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

219
00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:30.855
- Look. brother. it's not for you.
- Then who?

220
00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:32.731
It's for Carlitos.

221
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.775
Your son.

222
00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:39.655
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

223
00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:43.159
Hey. Pinilla!

224
00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:48.539
Your daughter just
got her driver's license. right?

225
00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:54.545
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

226
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:59.842
That friend of yours. Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

227
00:14:59.925 --> 00:15:03.345
- Right? She's a fox.
- [Gustavo] Yeah.

228
00:15:03.428 --> 00:15:05.223
Your wife is gorgeous. brother.

229
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.184
What's she doing with a guy like you?

230
00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:17.026
I think she deserves some jewelry. no?

231
00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:22.240
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

232
00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:28.829
Colonel. how is your mom doing?

233
00:15:28.913 --> 00:15:32.083
- She just got out of the hospital. right?
- Yes. she's feeling better.

234
00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:35.335
- Good. That makes us happy. right?
- [Gustavo] Yes.

235
00:15:36.587 --> 00:15:37.880
Gentlemen...

236
00:15:38.964 --> 00:15:41.133
I'm going to tell you who I am.

237
00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:45.512
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

238
00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:48.891
My eyes are everywhere.

239
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.937
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

240
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.105
without me knowing about it.

241
00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:57.275
Do you understand? Not a finger.

242
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:04.115
One day. I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

243
00:16:05.116 --> 00:16:09.245
So look. I make deals for a living.

244
00:16:09.328 --> 00:16:12.873
Now. you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

245
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:16.210
or accept the consequences.

246
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.215
Silver...

247
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.426
or lead.

248
00:16:25.928 --> 00:16:27.471
You decide.

249
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.061
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- [Pablo] All right. then.

250
00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:37.315
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

251
00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:50.869
[vibrant Latin song playing]

252
00:17:20.149 --> 00:17:21.733
[man shouts]
Yo. Pablo!

253
00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:24.195
- This is Pablo.
- [Cockroach] Hello.

254
00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:26.238
- Nice to meet you.
- [Gustavo] Mateo Moreno.

255
00:17:26.322 --> 00:17:28.824
No. no. no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

256
00:17:28.907 --> 00:17:30.826
[Gustavo] All right.
yesterday we were talking.

257
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:35.373
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

258
00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:36.832
Explain.

259
00:17:36.915 --> 00:17:39.960
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

260
00:17:40.044 --> 00:17:42.087
I will handle
the chemical part of production.

261
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:44.673
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

262
00:17:44.756 --> 00:17:47.176
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

263
00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:50.637
- Now tell him how much it costs.
- [chuckles]

264
00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:54.683
In Chile. this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

265
00:17:54.892 --> 00:17:58.520
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes. it's very good. Look...

266
00:17:58.603 --> 00:18:03.817
You do a little bit. and in 20 minutes.
you want to do some more.

267
00:18:04.026 --> 00:18:05.403
Also...

268
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.822
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

269
00:18:08.906 --> 00:18:11.450
It's very clean. this stuff.
Want some?

270
00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:15.162
If this is really that good
and we can make some money.

271
00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.164
- we can find room on our trucks.
- [Cockroach sniffs]

272
00:18:17.248 --> 00:18:19.708
We can sell it in Bogotá. Barranquilla.
Cali. Cartagena...

273
00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:22.169
We're going to be rich.

274
00:18:22.253 --> 00:18:25.005
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

275
00:18:26.798 --> 00:18:28.467
Well look. Cuca...

276
00:18:29.427 --> 00:18:31.470
you don't have any vision.
my friend.

277
00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:36.475
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

278
00:18:37.517 --> 00:18:40.729
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

279
00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:43.774
- [song ends]
- [grunts]

280
00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:46.318
- [light applause]
- [Pablo] I love that song.

281
00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:51.073
Rodrigo! One more.

282
00:18:51.156 --> 00:18:52.324
[stomps foot]

283
00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:54.576
[song begins again]

284
00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:57.704
[singing along in Spanish]

285
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.932
[Steve]
Back then. Miami was a paradise.

286
00:19:17.015 --> 00:19:19.893
I signed up for the sand.
surf and women.

287
00:19:21.603 --> 00:19:24.815
In '79. the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

288
00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:26.066
[Steve shouts]
DEA! Stop!

289
00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:30.279
I was a young DEA agent.
partnered with my buddy. Kevin Brady.

290
00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:33.532
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

291
00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:36.827
[grunts]

292
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.078
[Steve]
Why you running. huh?

293
00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:41.165
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

294
00:19:41.248 --> 00:19:42.166
What is that?

295
00:19:42.249 --> 00:19:45.377
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

296
00:19:45.461 --> 00:19:47.546
- [laughs]
- [exhales] Let's go celebrate.

297
00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:49.214
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

298
00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:51.550
[disco music playing]

299
00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:54.178
- Go! Go! Go!
- [laughing]

300
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:56.721
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Kevin] How you like me now?

301
00:19:56.805 --> 00:19:57.973
How much money you owe me?

302
00:19:58.182 --> 00:19:59.808
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

303
00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.519
That's right. that's right.

304
00:20:04.104 --> 00:20:07.107
All right.
All right. who do we pick?

305
00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:08.817
How 'bout her?

306
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.319
No. no. no.
we gotta fuck with him.

307
00:20:10.402 --> 00:20:12.404
- Yeah. let's mess with his head.
- Um...

308
00:20:12.488 --> 00:20:14.323
Oh. right there.
See her? At the bar?

309
00:20:14.406 --> 00:20:16.534
- Which one?
- Blue top. blond hair. That's his type.

310
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:19.703
- [Steve laughing] Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

311
00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:21.079
- All right.
- Whoo!

312
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.290
[clears throat]
Murph! Sparrow. three o'clock.

313
00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:27.211
Hey. while you were walking back.
she was checking your ass out.

314
00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:28.837
Oh. she was checking out your ass.

315
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.339
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

316
00:20:30.422 --> 00:20:34.301
[Kevin] Listen. she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

317
00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:37.054
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

318
00:20:37.262 --> 00:20:40.682
[snorts]
I'm serious. I'm serious. Look at her.

319
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:43.477
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

320
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:45.103
No. the other one.
Of course the blond one.

321
00:20:45.187 --> 00:20:46.897
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

322
00:20:47.647 --> 00:20:50.942
- You dicking me around?
- [Kevin laughs]

323
00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:55.280
Fuck it. I'm going in.

324
00:20:55.364 --> 00:20:56.532
- [Kevin] Go get her.
- [man] Mm!

325
00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:58.409

327
00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:03.205
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

328
00:21:03.414 --> 00:21:05.123
[men laughing]

329
00:21:05.207 --> 00:21:07.334
[women talking indistinctly]

330
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.716
How you doing?

331
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:16.552
Busy.

332
00:21:18.178 --> 00:21:21.681
I just said. "Look. if you don't
wanna be there. you don't have to be.

333
00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:24.976
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So. I don't know... [indistinct]

334
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.479
[men cackling]

335
00:21:28.397 --> 00:21:31.024
[Steve]
Yeah. those bastards got me.

336
00:21:31.108 --> 00:21:33.444
But I couldn't let it end like that.

337
00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:36.363
Excuse me. [clears throat]
See those guys over there?

338
00:21:37.656 --> 00:21:38.949
Uh. they're fucking with me.

339
00:21:39.032 --> 00:21:42.494
Telling me you were checking out my ass.
and who checks out a cop's ass. right?

340
00:21:42.578 --> 00:21:43.828
You're a cop?

341
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:46.248
Not a cop. actually. I'm DEA.

342
00:21:46.457 --> 00:21:47.499
Drug Enforcement?

343
00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:49.585
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

344
00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:52.963
Come on. why don't you do me a favor?
[clears throat]

345
00:21:53.046 --> 00:21:55.633
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you. uh...

346
00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:57.426
give me your phone number?

347
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.844
How about a fake number?

348
00:22:00.929 --> 00:22:01.930
That'll work.

349
00:22:02.764 --> 00:22:04.475
Hey. buddy. you got a pen?

350
00:22:07.436 --> 00:22:08.562
[sighs]

351
00:22:19.156 --> 00:22:21.741
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

352
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.244
Have a good night.

353
00:22:26.913 --> 00:22:29.625
- [Kevin] Aah...
- [men laughing]

354
00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:30.875
[Kevin] Shot down!

355
00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:34.713
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh. I...

356
00:22:35.422 --> 00:22:36.881
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

357
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.344
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

358
00:22:40.427 --> 00:22:42.887
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

359
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:44.640
How much did that cost you?

360
00:22:44.723 --> 00:22:46.850
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

361
00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:53.482
[dial tone]

362
00:22:53.565 --> 00:22:55.942
- [dialing number]
- [Steve] I figured. what the hell.

363
00:22:56.026 --> 00:22:59.446
Worst that could happen.
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

364
00:23:00.572 --> 00:23:02.700
[line ringing]

365
00:23:05.827 --> 00:23:07.037
Hello?

366
00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:09.998
So it wasn't a fake.

367
00:23:10.207 --> 00:23:12.543
I thought you might figure it out.

368
00:23:12.626 --> 00:23:15.045
After all. you're DEA.

369
00:23:15.128 --> 00:23:18.507
[Steve]
And just like that... she had me.

370
00:23:19.924 --> 00:23:24.971
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru.

371
00:23:25.055 --> 00:23:26.848
cocaine had him.

372
00:23:29.851 --> 00:23:31.269
[in Spanish]
It's been a while.

373
00:23:31.353 --> 00:23:33.938
These are my friends.
Pablo and Gustavo.

374
00:23:35.023 --> 00:23:37.442
Would you like a little coffee?

375
00:23:37.526 --> 00:23:39.152
Yeah. a coffee?

376
00:23:39.236 --> 00:23:40.237
Yes. a coffee.

377
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.405
- How about you. Pablo?
- No.

378
00:23:41.488 --> 00:23:43.031
[Cockroach]
You sure?

379
00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:47.244
My factory is small.
but highly productive.

380
00:23:47.327 --> 00:23:52.207
Look. For crushing the leaves. I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

381
00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:55.960
Little magic leaves.

382
00:23:56.878 --> 00:23:59.798
[man] The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

383
00:23:59.881 --> 00:24:05.845
[Cockroach] Over here. the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

384
00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:11.017
Then you cut it.
and mix it with gasoline.

385
00:24:11.101 --> 00:24:15.105
Then. basically. you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

386
00:24:15.188 --> 00:24:17.023
Let it dry. dry. dry.

387
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:18.858
[man]
You use ammonia to get the paste.

388
00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:24.489
[Cockroach] And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

389
00:24:24.573 --> 00:24:26.825
Here is the prize.

390
00:24:26.908 --> 00:24:29.327
It's like the kitchen in your house.

391
00:24:30.245 --> 00:24:33.415
Like baking a cake.
[clears throat]

392
00:24:34.249 --> 00:24:37.419
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

393
00:24:37.502 --> 00:24:39.504
[chuckling]

394
00:24:39.588 --> 00:24:41.715
Look. an old press. an antique.

395
00:24:46.177 --> 00:24:49.306
Now we put it in the oven.

396
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:52.016
Here's one.
The other will follow.

397
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.186
All natural. organic and healthy.
Very good.

398
00:24:56.062 --> 00:24:57.439
[Gustavo] Well...

399
00:24:58.523 --> 00:25:01.985
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

400
00:25:02.068 --> 00:25:05.280
- No.
- [man] You said a kilo.

401
00:25:05.363 --> 00:25:06.782
We'll take five.

402
00:25:06.865 --> 00:25:10.786
[softly]
How do we get five across the border?

403
00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:12.746
That's Gustavo's department.

404
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.462
[man]
This one has got a good engine.

405
00:25:20.545 --> 00:25:23.173
I was taking a look at it.
and the best place to hide the merchandise

406
00:25:23.256 --> 00:25:25.467
would be under the rear wheel well.

407
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.678
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

408
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:29.095
Is this easy to take off?

409
00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.890
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

410
00:25:31.973 --> 00:25:34.351
All right. all right.
I'll take three cars. please.

411
00:25:34.434 --> 00:25:37.395
- Sure. when do you need them?
- Now. brother.

412
00:25:38.188 --> 00:25:41.065
All right. we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

413
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:43.318
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

414
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:48.573
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

415
00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:50.868
- For three cars. that's 60 kilos.
- [Pablo counting softly]

416
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.287
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram. what?

417
00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:55.914
$9.000 per kilo.

418
00:25:55.997 --> 00:25:58.542
$9.000 times 60...
The profit is $540.000.

419
00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:00.836
- [laughing]
- That's it!

420
00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:02.754
- Do you know how to drive. Cockroach?
- Yeah.

421
00:26:02.838 --> 00:26:04.548
- OK. Pablo and I drive fast.
- [chuckling]

422
00:26:04.756 --> 00:26:08.510
[Steve]
That's half a million dollars... per trip.

423
00:26:08.593 --> 00:26:11.722
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

424
00:26:14.516 --> 00:26:16.309
Easiest money he ever made.

425
00:26:21.648 --> 00:26:24.568
Back in Medellín.
Pablo didn't waste any time.

426
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:26.319
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

427
00:26:26.403 --> 00:26:31.449
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

428
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.285
[in Spanish]
How are you feeling. Gustavo?

429
00:26:35.913 --> 00:26:37.873
All this smells like shit to me.

430
00:26:37.956 --> 00:26:41.501
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

431
00:26:41.585 --> 00:26:43.921
The stinkier. the better.

432
00:26:44.588 --> 00:26:45.839
All right.

433
00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:48.675
What about all these lights?

434
00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.763
Is that to tip off the cops.
or what?

435
00:26:52.846 --> 00:26:57.183
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

436
00:26:57.267 --> 00:27:00.186
I'm the artist here. clear?

437
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.479
Clear.

438
00:27:01.563 --> 00:27:03.607
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

439
00:27:03.774 --> 00:27:08.069
[Steve] It was a mom-and-pop operation.
so small they called it The Kitchen.

440
00:27:08.152 --> 00:27:11.907
But make no mistake.
it would change Medellín forever.

441
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.451
[in Spanish] You know the thing
that has me worried. Pablo?

442
00:27:17.621 --> 00:27:19.247
[exhales]

443
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:23.919
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

444
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.715
[inhales deeply]

445
00:27:31.593 --> 00:27:33.219
[voice strains]
Let's build them a chimney.

446
00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:35.430
- [sputtering]
- [giggles]

447
00:27:37.015 --> 00:27:39.517
- There you go.
- [laughing]

448
00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:43.521
[Gustavo]
Gentlemen. the first three?

449
00:27:43.605 --> 00:27:47.066
If this business makes so much money.
why are you sending me coach?

450
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.193
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

451
00:27:49.277 --> 00:27:52.530
- Don't be a dick.
- No. no. don't give me that dumb shit.

452
00:27:52.614 --> 00:27:56.117
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

453
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.286
[Gustavo] I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

454
00:28:01.498 --> 00:28:05.335
[Steve] Like her son. Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

455
00:28:06.044 --> 00:28:09.547
[Pablo speaking Spanish] Hey. Mom.
how much do you think we can fit in there?

456
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:13.051
- Around five kilos. honey.
- That much?

457
00:28:13.134 --> 00:28:14.552
Trust me. Pablito.

458
00:28:14.636 --> 00:28:16.596
I love it. Let's do it.

459
00:28:20.017 --> 00:28:22.602
- Pablo.
- Thank you. my love.

460
00:28:24.103 --> 00:28:25.563
[knocking at door]

461
00:28:25.647 --> 00:28:26.940
It's Gustavo.

462
00:28:27.816 --> 00:28:29.150
Five kilos. right?

463
00:28:29.233 --> 00:28:32.779
[Steve] Pablo loved his young bride Tata.
and she loved him.

464
00:28:32.863 --> 00:28:35.281
He was a family man till the end.

465
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:38.535
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

466
00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:40.453
- Meet my friend.
- Hello. how are you doing?

467
00:28:40.537 --> 00:28:41.663
Hey. Pablo. this is Lion.

468
00:28:41.746 --> 00:28:44.875
[Steve] He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

469
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:47.293
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich. right?

470
00:28:47.377 --> 00:28:49.379
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

471
00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:51.006
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you. Lion.

472
00:28:51.089 --> 00:28:52.340
Here's three.

473
00:28:52.423 --> 00:28:55.052
We're going to need two more.
right. Mom?

474
00:28:55.134 --> 00:28:56.928
- [Hermilda] That's right.
- Pablito...

475
00:28:57.012 --> 00:28:59.430
make sure it is not you
who wears it. OK?

476
00:28:59.514 --> 00:29:02.767
Look. my love...
it won't fit me. [chuckles]

477
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:04.602
Try it on.

478
00:29:04.686 --> 00:29:05.896
Come here.

479
00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:07.772
That's it.

480
00:29:07.856 --> 00:29:09.273
Good. right?

481
00:29:11.818 --> 00:29:12.861
One...

482
00:29:14.112 --> 00:29:16.239
- two...
- Wow. it holds a lot!

483
00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:17.782
...three.

484
00:29:17.866 --> 00:29:19.492
[sighs]

485
00:29:19.576 --> 00:29:21.619
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

486
00:29:21.703 --> 00:29:23.371
He looks really handsome.
doesn't he?

487
00:29:23.454 --> 00:29:26.332
[Hermilda] Listen. Lion.
that jacket fits you very nicely.

488
00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:30.003
Yeah. Excuse me. ma'am. can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

489
00:29:30.087 --> 00:29:31.588
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

490
00:29:31.671 --> 00:29:33.757
He looks very handsome. son.

491
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.175
- Like a fag model. isn't that right?
- [chuckles]

492
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:41.180
[Steve] The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

493
00:29:44.267 --> 00:29:45.602
Welcome to the United States.

494
00:29:45.685 --> 00:29:48.354
Thank you.
Have a great day.

495
00:29:48.438 --> 00:29:49.313
Next. please.

496
00:29:49.397 --> 00:29:53.192
[Steve] His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder.

497
00:29:53.276 --> 00:29:58.156
half Colombian. half German.
and 100 percent playboy.

498
00:29:58.239 --> 00:30:01.534
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

499
00:30:01.618 --> 00:30:03.411
Go figure.

500
00:30:03.494 --> 00:30:07.415
Back in '79. this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

501
00:30:07.498 --> 00:30:09.084
on a fleet of small planes.

502
00:30:09.167 --> 00:30:11.086
- [in Spanish] What's up?
- What's up. son?

503
00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:13.212
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

504
00:30:13.296 --> 00:30:14.798
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

505
00:30:14.881 --> 00:30:16.507
Whoo! It's so hot.

506
00:30:16.591 --> 00:30:18.468
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

507
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:19.928
You like my jacket. brother?

508
00:30:20.011 --> 00:30:23.140
I got it in Colombia and look.
it has a little gift.

509
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.769
I was in jail for a while. remember?

510
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.898
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

511
00:30:31.982 --> 00:30:34.776
What you got there
is the perfect product.

512
00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:37.320
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

513
00:30:37.403 --> 00:30:40.239
[laughs] It's gonna fuck up their brains.
that's for sure.

514
00:30:40.323 --> 00:30:41.365
Yes. sir.

515
00:30:45.078 --> 00:30:46.245
Here you go.

516
00:30:47.705 --> 00:30:49.833
Go on. There are five kilos.

517
00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:51.668
Where are you going?

518
00:30:51.918 --> 00:30:54.337
I'm gonna get another jacket.
brother.

519
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.756
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow.
all right?

520
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.638
[Steve] The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

521
00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:06.016
Drugs in. cash out.

522
00:31:06.224 --> 00:31:09.352
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

523
00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:12.897
And in no time.
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

524
00:31:14.024 --> 00:31:16.567
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes.

525
00:31:16.651 --> 00:31:19.029
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

526
00:31:20.071 --> 00:31:22.115
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

527
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.743
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

528
00:31:25.827 --> 00:31:28.287
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

529
00:31:28.371 --> 00:31:32.167
Ten trucks. 20 kilos each.
going back and forth every day...

530
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.337
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

531
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.798
Pretty soon.
the Lion had to come up with new ways

532
00:31:38.882 --> 00:31:40.967
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

533
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:43.678
[in Spanish]
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

534
00:31:43.761 --> 00:31:46.264
You guys are pilots.

535
00:31:46.347 --> 00:31:49.726
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

536
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:55.648
Look. it's $150.000 per kilo.
so whatever you want.

537
00:31:57.275 --> 00:31:58.693
We'll take four.

538
00:31:58.776 --> 00:32:00.237
All right. much better.

539
00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:05.033
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

540
00:32:05.116 --> 00:32:08.161
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

541
00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:09.787
- See you later.
- Later.

542
00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:12.498
Come in. please.

543
00:32:17.628 --> 00:32:20.381
Look. here are the packets.

544
00:32:20.464 --> 00:32:24.052
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

545
00:32:24.135 --> 00:32:25.428
Easy. right?

546
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:28.056
You swallow 50.
and I pay you $10.000.

547
00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:29.224
All right?

548
00:32:29.307 --> 00:32:31.392
But with you two.
we have a problem.

549
00:32:31.475 --> 00:32:33.394
You girls are pregnant. right?

550
00:32:33.477 --> 00:32:38.108
That's good. because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

551
00:32:38.191 --> 00:32:43.029
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

552
00:32:43.113 --> 00:32:46.241
And I'll pay you $15.000
to help you with the kids.

553
00:32:46.324 --> 00:32:48.785
All right? All right. Perfect.

554
00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:52.705
[Steve] During the early '80s.
most flights out of Bogotá

555
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:54.624
had several mules on them.

556
00:32:54.707 --> 00:32:56.793
They didn't even know about each other.

557
00:32:56.876 --> 00:32:58.461
And you know what?

558
00:32:58.544 --> 00:33:02.673
Getting in was easy. because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

559
00:33:02.757 --> 00:33:04.717
All we cared about was grass.

560
00:33:06.594 --> 00:33:07.720
[clucking]

561
00:33:07.804 --> 00:33:12.309
Pretty soon. cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

562
00:33:12.391 --> 00:33:16.437
Fish. coffee. flowers. rubber hoses...
anything.

563
00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:35.498
But even that didn't do it.

564
00:33:36.374 --> 00:33:40.837
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

565
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.050
[in Spanish]
Do you trust this guy?

566
00:33:46.134 --> 00:33:48.719
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

567
00:33:48.803 --> 00:33:51.889
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh. for sure he's gay.

568
00:33:51.973 --> 00:33:53.599
But he's got good routes.

569
00:33:57.687 --> 00:33:59.314
- Amigos!
- [Gustavo] Hello. Carlos.

570
00:33:59.397 --> 00:34:00.773
Gustavo Gaviria.
nice to meet you.

571
00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:02.108
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

572
00:34:02.192 --> 00:34:04.027
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

573
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.113
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

574
00:34:07.197 --> 00:34:08.698
Smooth.

575
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:10.033
Let's get down to business.

576
00:34:10.116 --> 00:34:13.995
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

577
00:34:14.078 --> 00:34:17.332
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

578
00:34:18.124 --> 00:34:20.126
- How far?
- Miami.

579
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.294
[sighs]

580
00:34:24.005 --> 00:34:26.590
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- [Gustavo] 1000 kilos?

581
00:34:26.674 --> 00:34:28.426
Counting the gasoline.

582
00:34:37.227 --> 00:34:38.353
Carlos...

583
00:34:39.229 --> 00:34:40.355
[Carlos] Yes?

584
00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:47.778
What if we take out the seats.
the carpet and all the other crap

585
00:34:47.862 --> 00:34:51.657
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

586
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:53.492
We'll leave the engine. right?

587
00:34:54.785 --> 00:34:56.287
- How much more?
- [chuckles]

588
00:34:56.371 --> 00:34:58.789
About... 300 more.

589
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.836
All right then. Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

590
00:35:06.464 --> 00:35:08.258
[Steve]
Within months after meeting Cockroach.

591
00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:13.430
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

592
00:35:14.764 --> 00:35:18.101
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics. folks.

593
00:35:19.102 --> 00:35:22.272
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

594
00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:23.856
in the middle of the jungle.

595
00:35:26.525 --> 00:35:28.903
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest.

596
00:35:28.986 --> 00:35:33.991
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

597
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:37.912
[clanging]

598
00:35:37.995 --> 00:35:40.290
[in Spanish]
We brought you a little present.

599
00:35:40.373 --> 00:35:42.166
- [chatter in Spanish]
- [woman laughs]

600
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.667
[Pablo]
Brazilians.

601
00:35:45.295 --> 00:35:48.547
Best asses in the world.
believe me.

602
00:35:48.631 --> 00:35:51.134
No. I'm not feeling well.

603
00:35:51.217 --> 00:35:52.760
- What's up. Cuca?
- Hello.

604
00:35:53.636 --> 00:35:54.720
Hey. Gustavo.

605
00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:58.182
What the fuck is up with you guys?

606
00:35:58.266 --> 00:36:00.935
You're flying around in planes...

607
00:36:01.018 --> 00:36:03.313
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look. Cuca--

608
00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:06.065
Look. let us explain what we have to--

609
00:36:06.149 --> 00:36:07.817
Wait.

610
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.195
From now on.
in all of my labs...

611
00:36:11.279 --> 00:36:15.866
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning. with a pool...

612
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.369
- [Gustavo] And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.

613
00:36:18.453 --> 00:36:20.871
- Just for you.
- One problem.

614
00:36:20.955 --> 00:36:24.875
These are my labs. Mm?

615
00:36:30.756 --> 00:36:34.969
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

616
00:36:35.052 --> 00:36:37.472
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

617
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:40.808
[Steve] Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

618
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:44.562
They were violent. crazy and filthy rich.

619
00:36:44.645 --> 00:36:47.857
Guys used to getting what they want.
one way or another.

620
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.652
[in Spanish] How something like this
can make so much money!

621
00:36:51.735 --> 00:36:55.906
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

622
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.950
What do you think. Pablo?

623
00:36:58.034 --> 00:37:00.411
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

624
00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:02.163
I wouldn't get involved.

625
00:37:02.246 --> 00:37:05.500
Look. man.
I took a good look at the market.

626
00:37:05.708 --> 00:37:07.835
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

627
00:37:07.918 --> 00:37:12.298
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

628
00:37:12.382 --> 00:37:15.301
Be careful. guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time.

629
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.096
the Peruvians will raise the price.

630
00:37:20.598 --> 00:37:23.100
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

631
00:37:23.184 --> 00:37:26.604
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

632
00:37:26.687 --> 00:37:31.442
Well. guys. the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

633
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.905
You need a lot of creativity for that.

634
00:37:36.697 --> 00:37:40.159
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

635
00:37:40.243 --> 00:37:44.038
You deliver the product to me. labeled.

636
00:37:44.121 --> 00:37:47.666
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

637
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.336
Better yet. Lehder will do it.

638
00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.506
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value.

639
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:58.094
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

640
00:37:58.177 --> 00:38:00.012
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

641
00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:01.847
Deal?

642
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:06.269
Deal.

643
00:38:06.977 --> 00:38:08.563
Sounds good to me.

644
00:38:10.022 --> 00:38:14.026
All right.
I will create my own routes

645
00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.655
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

646
00:38:17.738 --> 00:38:19.616
[Gustavo]
We expect nothing less. Gonzalo.

647
00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:22.076
Partners?

648
00:38:26.163 --> 00:38:28.958
We know your policy toward partners.

649
00:38:30.543 --> 00:38:32.211
Let's just call us...

650
00:38:32.462 --> 00:38:34.046
"friendly associates."

651
00:38:35.881 --> 00:38:37.341
To Miami.

652
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.510
[all]
To Miami!

653
00:38:41.304 --> 00:38:42.888
[up-tempo '80s rock music plays]

654
00:38:49.687 --> 00:38:54.191
[Steve] When I started. a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

655
00:39:00.406 --> 00:39:04.118
And before long.
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

656
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.666
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

657
00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:18.675
Truth is.
we weren't even making a dent.

658
00:39:19.967 --> 00:39:22.928
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

659
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.357
Pablo's coke flooded in.

660
00:39:35.399 --> 00:39:37.901
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

661
00:39:37.985 --> 00:39:39.445
And I mean that.

662
00:39:40.279 --> 00:39:43.700
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

663
00:39:45.201 --> 00:39:46.703
And with the money...

664
00:39:47.786 --> 00:39:49.664
came the violence.

665
00:39:51.915 --> 00:39:53.834
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians.

666
00:39:53.917 --> 00:39:56.587
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

667
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:23.573
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

668
00:40:25.157 --> 00:40:27.493
Use 'em once.
then throw 'em away.

669
00:40:28.911 --> 00:40:32.998
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

670
00:40:33.082 --> 00:40:35.959
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

671
00:40:36.043 --> 00:40:38.003
to hold all the extra corpses.

672
00:40:40.214 --> 00:40:42.049
That was the first person I ever shot.

673
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.511
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

674
00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:08.325
Hey... it was self-defense.

675
00:41:08.534 --> 00:41:11.495
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

676
00:41:12.413 --> 00:41:14.498
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

677
00:41:15.499 --> 00:41:17.126
He sells drugs. right?

678
00:41:18.544 --> 00:41:20.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah. then fuck him.

679
00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:23.299
[sighs]

680
00:41:27.428 --> 00:41:28.721
What happened?

681
00:41:32.015 --> 00:41:34.560
- Coming through!
- [Connie] I was about to finish my shift

682
00:41:34.811 --> 00:41:36.895
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

683
00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:38.314
Stay with me.

684
00:41:38.522 --> 00:41:39.982
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

685
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.069
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

686
00:41:44.278 --> 00:41:47.615
By the time she got to us.
she was barely breathing.

687
00:41:47.698 --> 00:41:51.452
- [nurse] Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils. rapid pulse.

688
00:41:51.535 --> 00:41:53.996
- I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...
- [flatline tone]

689
00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:57.792
...but she had no residue on her nostrils.
no injection marks.

690
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.004
We did everything we could.

691
00:42:03.088 --> 00:42:04.715
She died in the ER.

692
00:42:07.092 --> 00:42:08.886
We tried to save the baby...

693
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:16.435
The baby died in my hands.

694
00:42:19.188 --> 00:42:20.690
I'm so sorry.

695
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.443
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

696
00:42:25.361 --> 00:42:27.070
Two of the pellets split open.

697
00:42:28.947 --> 00:42:32.618
[sighs]
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

698
00:42:34.912 --> 00:42:36.622
No one survives that.

699
00:42:40.877 --> 00:42:42.920
[bugs chirring]

700
00:42:44.254 --> 00:42:47.675
[in Spanish]
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

701
00:42:47.758 --> 00:42:51.470
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

702
00:42:51.554 --> 00:42:53.723
Tell me something. Cockroach.

703
00:42:53.806 --> 00:42:56.433
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

704
00:42:56.517 --> 00:43:00.020
[dry chuckle] Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

705
00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:05.067
If it wasn't for me. you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

706
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.944
Let me give you a piece of advice.

707
00:43:08.529 --> 00:43:10.406
Never say that to Pablo.

708
00:43:11.281 --> 00:43:13.492
He's not as forgiving as I am.

709
00:43:19.498 --> 00:43:21.584
[Steve]
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

710
00:43:21.792 --> 00:43:25.045
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

711
00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:28.966
Instead. he found another way
to get his fair share.

712
00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:34.388
- [man shouts in Spanish] Stop!
- [chatter in Spanish]

713
00:43:44.774 --> 00:43:46.859
What do you have in the spare tires?

714
00:43:49.653 --> 00:43:53.031
390 kilos. Pablo.
We lost it.

715
00:43:54.116 --> 00:43:57.369
Gustavo. what do you mean
"we lost it"?

716
00:43:57.453 --> 00:43:59.329
Just what I said. we lost it.

717
00:44:00.414 --> 00:44:05.544
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

718
00:44:05.628 --> 00:44:08.672
Don't mess with me. Pablo.
We lost it.

719
00:44:08.756 --> 00:44:12.050
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

720
00:44:13.343 --> 00:44:14.470
Look...

721
00:44:15.471 --> 00:44:20.768
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

722
00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:24.772
So how did we lose a load. brother?

723
00:44:24.855 --> 00:44:28.233
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

724
00:44:28.317 --> 00:44:29.819
Know what I mean?

725
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:37.159
And how much is he asking?

726
00:44:38.368 --> 00:44:39.745
Too much.

727
00:44:45.793 --> 00:44:47.294
What are you going to do?

728
00:44:48.629 --> 00:44:50.006
Come back. Pablo.

729
00:44:51.507 --> 00:44:54.426
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

730
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.178
Where are you going. Pablo?

731
00:44:56.887 --> 00:44:58.138
Pablo?

732
00:45:33.298 --> 00:45:35.759
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

733
00:45:48.856 --> 00:45:50.273
What's going on. brother?

734
00:45:52.275 --> 00:45:53.610
Mr. Escobar...

735
00:45:54.987 --> 00:45:57.990
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

736
00:46:02.828 --> 00:46:05.622
Eat. Shit.

737
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.210
What if I shot you in the head?

738
00:46:13.255 --> 00:46:16.092
- [phone ringing nearby]
- [chatter in Spanish]

739
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.311
[Ibarra]
Are you sure about this. Colonel?

740
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.731
[Pablo laughs]

741
00:46:30.814 --> 00:46:33.776
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

742
00:46:33.859 --> 00:46:38.196
- [Pablo chortling]
- We're DAS. Ibarra.

743
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.240
What's that faggot gonna do?

744
00:46:43.786 --> 00:46:45.245
[photographer]
There we are.

745
00:46:45.328 --> 00:46:47.123
No. lower. lower.

746
00:46:47.205 --> 00:46:48.540
No that low.

747
00:46:51.085 --> 00:46:52.711
Ready.

748
00:46:52.795 --> 00:46:54.713
- [clears throat]
- [camera clicks]

749
00:46:57.174 --> 00:46:59.176
Another one. another one.
I'm ready.

750
00:46:59.384 --> 00:47:01.637
[Pablo clears throat]

751
00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:05.849
- [Steve] Pablo didn't know it then...
- [camera clicks]

752
00:47:05.933 --> 00:47:09.686
...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

753
00:47:13.356 --> 00:47:15.651
[Ibarra speaking Spanish]
Remove the handcuffs.

754
00:47:20.906 --> 00:47:22.491
[Herrera]
You can go now. officer.

755
00:47:23.951 --> 00:47:25.494
Sit down. Mr. Pablo.

756
00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:34.628
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

757
00:47:36.546 --> 00:47:41.551
That's a street value
of over four million dollars. Mr. Escobar.

758
00:47:42.302 --> 00:47:44.721
And you only gave us $150.000.

759
00:47:46.264 --> 00:47:48.851
Well. that's what we agreed upon.

760
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.895
You know something?

761
00:47:51.979 --> 00:47:55.024
I make deals for a living.

762
00:47:55.107 --> 00:48:00.154
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

763
00:48:03.866 --> 00:48:07.036
Or we can renegotiate.
come to an agreement.

764
00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:09.663
and everyone goes home happy.

765
00:48:12.208 --> 00:48:13.333
Deal?

766
00:48:17.379 --> 00:48:19.173
[sighs softly]

767
00:48:21.508 --> 00:48:23.886
I'll give you one million dollars...

768
00:48:25.387 --> 00:48:27.472
under one condition.

769
00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:30.392
What is it?

770
00:48:32.477 --> 00:48:36.356
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

771
00:48:37.524 --> 00:48:39.735
Otherwise. how would you know?

772
00:48:43.572 --> 00:48:45.657
Give me a name...

773
00:48:47.868 --> 00:48:51.038
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

774
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:58.170
[Steve]
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

775
00:48:58.254 --> 00:49:01.423
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities.

776
00:49:01.506 --> 00:49:05.177
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami. too.

777
00:49:07.221 --> 00:49:12.475
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata.
a Colombian with a plumbing business

778
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:15.271
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

779
00:49:16.438 --> 00:49:21.193
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

780
00:49:24.487 --> 00:49:26.073
The plan was to trade vehicles.

781
00:49:26.156 --> 00:49:29.243
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

782
00:49:30.869 --> 00:49:33.455
1200 kilos.

783
00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:36.374
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

784
00:49:37.459 --> 00:49:39.962
OK. gringos.

785
00:49:40.045 --> 00:49:42.047
How's the plumbing business?

786
00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:43.465
Fine.

787
00:49:43.548 --> 00:49:45.175
[murmur greetings in Spanish]

788
00:49:46.927 --> 00:49:49.930
- [speaking English] How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

789
00:49:50.013 --> 00:49:51.640
[Kevin chuckles]

790
00:49:51.723 --> 00:49:53.850
Come on. amigo.
I'll show you.

791
00:49:55.435 --> 00:49:56.979
[Steve]
Everything was going perfect.

792
00:49:57.187 --> 00:50:02.067
Like I said. amigo...
100 percent pure.

793
00:50:02.151 --> 00:50:04.069
[Steve]
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

794
00:50:04.153 --> 00:50:06.822
- Got a full load here. Murph--
- [automatic gunfire]

795
00:50:06.989 --> 00:50:08.615
[screaming]

796
00:50:09.866 --> 00:50:11.660
[car alarm wailing]

797
00:50:12.369 --> 00:50:13.620
[single gunshot]

798
00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:17.040
Don't move! Don't move.

799
00:50:17.124 --> 00:50:20.252
- Don't move! Don't move.
- [man speaks Spanish]

800
00:50:20.336 --> 00:50:21.628
Get down!

801
00:50:25.048 --> 00:50:27.384
- Hands! Down!
- [car alarm stops]

802
00:50:27.467 --> 00:50:28.551
Don't look at me.

803
00:50:32.055 --> 00:50:33.265
[whispers] Fucking...

804
00:50:52.868 --> 00:50:57.414
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz.

805
00:50:57.497 --> 00:51:00.625
after taking into account
all due considerations.

806
00:51:00.709 --> 00:51:05.922
bail has been set at two million dollars.
or a bond of $200.000.

807
00:51:06.006 --> 00:51:07.174
[slams gavel]

808
00:51:07.257 --> 00:51:10.593
[Steve] I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

809
00:51:10.677 --> 00:51:13.763
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

810
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.436
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars.

811
00:51:19.519 --> 00:51:24.233
paid by a wire transfer from. well...
why don't you take a guess?

812
00:51:25.483 --> 00:51:28.778
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

813
00:51:31.573 --> 00:51:37.913
From '79 to '84.
there were 3.245 murders in Miami.

814
00:51:38.997 --> 00:51:41.208
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops.

815
00:51:41.417 --> 00:51:43.710
no one much cared about that.

816
00:51:43.919 --> 00:51:48.257
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

817
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.886
Billions of dollars a year.
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

818
00:51:53.887 --> 00:51:56.973
And that... America couldn't take.

819
00:51:58.558 --> 00:52:02.812
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

820
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:07.067
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

821
00:52:07.984 --> 00:52:12.448
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

822
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:15.951
Whatever it was. the businessmen
came at just the right time.

823
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:18.870
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

824
00:52:18.954 --> 00:52:22.332
[Steve] It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

825
00:52:23.166 --> 00:52:25.585
Drugs are menacing our society.

826
00:52:25.668 --> 00:52:29.214
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

827
00:52:29.298 --> 00:52:31.383
They're killing our children.

828
00:52:31.467 --> 00:52:33.260
[Steve]
It was classic Reagan.

829
00:52:33.343 --> 00:52:36.263
Folksy. direct and tough.

830
00:52:36.346 --> 00:52:39.599
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

831
00:52:39.808 --> 00:52:42.018
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

832
00:52:42.102 --> 00:52:46.315
So to my young friends out there.
life can be great.

833
00:52:46.398 --> 00:52:48.525
But not when you can't see it.

834
00:52:48.608 --> 00:52:53.822
So open your eyes to life. to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

835
00:52:53.905 --> 00:52:56.199
as a precious gift to His children.

836
00:52:56.283 --> 00:52:58.285
Say yes to your life.

837
00:52:58.368 --> 00:53:02.664
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

838
00:53:02.747 --> 00:53:05.208
No. no. no!
No. Pablo. no. no!

839
00:53:05.292 --> 00:53:06.376
- No. no!
- [gunshot]

840
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.294
[gasps]

841
00:53:11.006 --> 00:53:14.384
[Steve] They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world.

842
00:53:14.468 --> 00:53:16.470
only the cockroaches will survive.

843
00:53:16.553 --> 00:53:18.680
Leave that piece of shit there.

844
00:53:18.763 --> 00:53:20.640
[Steve]
I guess they were wrong.

845
00:53:22.476 --> 00:53:25.687
During his career.
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

846
00:53:26.563 --> 00:53:28.482
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

847
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:38.283
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

848
00:53:38.492 --> 00:53:40.536
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

849
00:53:41.495 --> 00:53:42.954
No way.

850
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:48.168
He was a West Virginia farm boy.
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

851
00:53:49.127 --> 00:53:51.963
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

852
00:53:53.006 --> 00:53:54.508
It was his duty.

853
00:53:56.176 --> 00:53:58.303
Cocaine in Miami?

854
00:53:58.387 --> 00:54:00.305
Kilos from Colombia?

855
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:03.683
This was my war.

856
00:54:03.766 --> 00:54:06.269
This was my duty.

857
00:54:06.353 --> 00:54:08.146
And I was ready to fight it.

858
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:10.815
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me. too.

859
00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:12.108
Your ticket. please.

860
00:54:13.485 --> 00:54:14.652
OK.

861
00:54:14.736 --> 00:54:17.739
We had no idea
what we were in for.

862
00:54:19.115 --> 00:54:23.412
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

863
00:54:23.495 --> 00:54:25.163
[Javier over radio]
OK. man. what do we got?

864
00:54:25.247 --> 00:54:28.375
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

865
00:54:28.458 --> 00:54:29.792
We got Lizard.

866
00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:32.670
Uh...

867
00:54:32.754 --> 00:54:34.172
We got. we got...

868
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.886
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

869
00:54:39.969 --> 00:54:42.639
- Thank you for the gift. agent.
- No problem.

870
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:45.517
[camera shutter clicks]

871
00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.325
[Steve] If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world.

872
00:55:02.409 --> 00:55:05.412
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

873
00:55:06.455 --> 00:55:10.125
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

874
00:55:11.418 --> 00:55:15.297
In the world of drug dealers.
you do what you think is right...

875
00:55:16.214 --> 00:55:18.258
- and hope for the best.
- [camera shutter clicks]

876
00:55:19.384 --> 00:55:21.970
[man speaks Spanish]
Look at what happened. boss.

877
00:55:22.053 --> 00:55:24.389
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

878
00:55:27.225 --> 00:55:30.270
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

879
00:55:30.353 --> 00:55:33.482
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

880
00:55:37.569 --> 00:55:40.238
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo. sir?

881
00:55:42.491 --> 00:55:46.119
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

882
00:55:46.202 --> 00:55:47.663
Half a million?

883
00:55:47.745 --> 00:55:48.955
Do it.

884
00:55:49.038 --> 00:55:50.540
As you wish. sir.

885
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.797
Fucking gringos.

886
00:56:00.008 --> 00:56:03.011
