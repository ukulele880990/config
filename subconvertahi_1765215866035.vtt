00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:11.380
Meet our new doorman.
We named him after the dead one.

4
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:15.010
What's happening to our sweet
little murder building?

5
00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:16.802
Things are changing fast.

6
00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:18.846
You... You go. uh. talk to Lester's wife.

7
00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.932
- [Oliver Putnam] Lillian loves me.
- [Mabel Mora] It's Lorraine.

8
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.850
I'm in Dr. Tidyman's trial group.

9
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:25.144
and I'd like to get
the next four doses of...

10
00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:27.939
Nicky used to carry these decks around
everywhere he went.

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.943
- Maybe it's something.
- I have a facility with cards.

[Sofia Caccimelio] Oh.

13

Among other things.

14
00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:36.364
This table's been through it.

15
00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:38.157
What do you think happened here?

16
00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:40.743
I was playing with these bozos
the night Nicky died.

17
00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.954
So Nicky... "chh!"...
chopped off his finger.

18
00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:45.122
[Mabel]
Jay lost his right finger.

19
00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:47.750
The finger we have curves left.

20
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:49.168
This isn't his finger.

[Oliver] <i>They're all dirty.</i>

27
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.558
Wow. this was really under
the Arconia all these years?

28
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.104
Yes. and Lester and Nicky
have both been here.

29

in this ta... table?

46
00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:53.941
Well. it must have been done
by a cleaver.

47
00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:56.319
but it's been repaired...?

48
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.030
And under here is a...
a-a-a secret drawer

49
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:01.240
where we found an envelope full of money.

50
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:03.409
It opens with a code
from the roulette wheel.

51
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.119
[Mabel Mora] Okay. got it.

52
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.662
Oh. now hold on a goddamn minute.

53
00:02:06.663 --> 00:02:10.416
You mean to tell me that there's been
this giant-ass gaming palace

down here the whole time.

55
00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.128
but you guys
are just finding out about it?

56
00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.006
Well. to be fair. I just found out
this building has a gym.

57
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:18.717
Hmm. I don't know.

58
00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:21.886
It looks pretty fucking clean. guys.

59
00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:23.929
I could eat lamb chops
on this poker table.

60
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.973
But we saw blood.

61
00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:28.100
They... They... They cleaned.

62
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.895
Are you telling me that the super-villains
got in here with a Swiffer?

63
00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:32.855
Of course. they didn't.
And that's your in.

64
00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:34.940
Somebody's cleaning up
after these motherfuckers.

65
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.569
which probably means it's someone
that works in the building.

66
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.279

Rich people are constantly
doing dumb shit in front of them.

69
00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:48.120
She's right.
And they probably paid off the police.

70
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.081
You know. two cops showed up
at the dry cleaners

71
00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:52.667

72
00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:53.835

[Detective Williams] Oh. yeah!

74
00:02:56.213 --> 00:02:58.214
Okay. so that one over there
is Bobby.

Do you actually know
how many people are in the NYPD?

79
00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:07.807
And even if I could ID these guys.
I wouldn't.

80
00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:10.768
Because the last guy
that tried to expose dirty cops

81
00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.812
had to move to Florida.

82
00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:14.438
God. does that mean he got killed?

83
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.566
No. it means
he actually has to <i>live</i> in Florida.

There's nothing to find here?

in here missed one thing.

and only five made it back
to my apartment.

106
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:14.957
So. these people saw my shrimp

107
00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.001
unattended in the lobby
and just helped themselves.

Nothing.

to join a trial group of guys my age.

tastes like pennies.

it had all been cleaned up.

if he was missing a finger?

in my wedding shrimp?

Are we even allowed
to be in the staff locker room?

Well. if we can't get the staff to talk.

- Good to see you.

- Any word from Charles?
- Nothing.

520
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.808
But we shouldn't panic.
Charles is a grown man...

521
00:21:54.683 --> 00:21:57.393
who's on a downward spiral
and strung out on T.

522
00:21:57.394 --> 00:21:59.479
Yes. quite possibly
he's dead in a dumpster.

523
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.815
Well. in other bad news.
I went on the internet

524
00:22:01.816 --> 00:22:03.483
to search "Tommy the Tongue".

525
00:22:03.484 --> 00:22:05.401
Didn't find anything that wasn't porn.

526
00:22:05.402 --> 00:22:08.071
I even begged Williams
to run his name at the station.

Mabel. I'm telling you.
this building meeting is our ticket.

We make the staff fall in love with us

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.829
and tell us everything we need to know
about Tommy the Tongue.

00:22:21.836 --> 00:22:24.003
Last night I was using
LESTR's makeover app

534
00:22:24.004 --> 00:22:28.342
to try new beard styles.
and I stumbled upon a feature.

535
00:22:29.009 --> 00:22:32.637
A ranking system for each tenant
in the building.

536
00:22:32.638 --> 00:22:34.556
We all have a numerical value.

537
00:22:34.557 --> 00:22:36.683
Isn't that dystopian and fabulous?

538
00:22:36.684 --> 00:22:39.269
And the robot decides our value how?

539
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.646
Some combination
of dead Lester's paperwork.

540
00:22:41.647 --> 00:22:42.981
which was all uploaded.

541
00:22:42.982 --> 00:22:45.608

into his listening device.

542
00:22:45.609 --> 00:22:47.235
and a certain <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

543
00:22:47.236 --> 00:22:49.988
which he will never reveal.

544
00:22:49.989 --> 00:22:51.489
And don't bother asking your ranking.

545
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.158
because you will have to die

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.660
Okay. Mabel. you're four.

That's not bad.

00:23:51.258 --> 00:23:55.845

in this building a long time.

that we shouldn't stand for.

And I think I speak
for all of us tenants when I say

that we are not gonna sit back
and let our beloved staff

more connected to my body.

N-Not now. Charles.
I've just been through something.

That robot was my best friend.

- What about Sevelyn and Gravey?

But on the plus side.

- Right.

What?!
Y-Yes. we are mad.

00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:31.884
Well. I think I might
have left it in the minivan.

751

Or Sofia stole it.

Okay. this. um. sucks.

But at least she doesn't have
your passcode.

761

- I did happen to reveal that.
