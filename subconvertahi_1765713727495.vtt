﻿1
00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.705
Okay. turn left up here.

2
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.307
And can you step on the gas

3
00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:10.275
a little?

4
00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.224
(<i> tires squealing</i>)
(<i> horn honking</i>)

5
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:15.925
MAN: Hey!
PHOEBE:
Off the gas!

6
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.049
Off the gas!

7
00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:18.595
Does somebody else
want to drive here?

8
00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.330
Phoebe. the demon
is not waiting around

9
00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.087
for us to come and vanquish him.

10
00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.789
We don't even know if we have
the power to vanquish him.

11
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.436
Scrying for random evil
tells us nothing.

12
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.904
It tells us
where the demons are.

13
00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.572
and since we vanquished two
already this week.

14
00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.840
I'd say
it's working pretty well.

15
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.298
Yeah. thanks to Cole
for saving our butts.

16
00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.945
PHOEBE:
Two witches
and a half a demon does not

17
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.669
the Power of Three make.

18
00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.582
So what are we supposed to do.
sit around

19
00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.418
and wait for them
to pick us all off?

20
00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.653
If we weren't going after them.
they'd be coming after us.

21
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.155
They're coming after you
anyway. Piper.

22
00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.445
The Source is coming after you.

23
00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:47.857
PHOEBE:
And we won't be
ready for him.

24
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.549
because instead of teaching
Paige how to be a witch.

25
00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:53.252
we are out hunting
for every Tom. Dick and...

26
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.521
Beelzebub in San Francisco.

27
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.700
Speaking of. do we have any kind
of plan here or...?

28
00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.069
The plan is to vanquish
the demon.

29
00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.504
Great. Any chance you've
mastered your powers.

30
00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:02.506
or are you still freezing
and exploding at random?
Random.

31
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.862
But you know what they say...

32
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.708
There's nothing like
field practice. Turn here!

33
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.998
(<i> tires squeal</i>)

34
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.242
(<i> tires screech</i>)
Stop!

35
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:21.113
PIPER:
Hey. big scary demon.

36
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:23.148
Huh?

37
00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.950
(<i> growls</i>)

38
00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.169
He's gonna blow!

39
00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.531

What's the hold-up
on the O'Brien application?

65
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:26.064
Well. at the moment.
the only hold-up is

66
00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:30.108
my boss is standing over me.
distracting me from my work.

67
00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:31.776
Nice teeth.

68
00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.112

Adam O'Brien?

we're trying
to get into the boarding school?

73
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.257
Oh. my God.

74
00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:47.204
The scholarship application
is due. like. today.

75
00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:49.894
I'm so lame.

76
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.332
Aw. Billy. I thought

77
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.301
I told you to throw anything
from creditors in the trash.

78
00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.338
Hi... pizza-face.

79
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.240
Look. I understand

80
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.348
how difficult it is
to tear yourself away

81
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.188
from the cleavage
in this section.

82
00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.511
<i>but</i> I'm gonna need

83
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.012
my mail sometime today.

84
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.381
okay?
No problem.

85
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.519
Go. go.

86
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.391
Nice rug.

87
00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:25.430

What the hell!

88
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.544
WOMAN:
Look at him!
What happened to his hair.

89
00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:30.135
(<i> laughter</i>)

90
00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.903
(<i> laughing</i>):
I didn't know
he was bald!

91
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.656
Oh. I know that
you're happy that
we got him Piper.

92
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.581
but is it entirely necessary
to disfigure<i> The Book?</i>

93
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.015
Hmm. this one could incinerate

94
00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.285
human flesh with his eyes.

95
00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.553
That must sting.

96
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.690
You think that's funny?

97
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.359
You could have gotten yourself
killed. you understand that?

98
00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:56.995
Yes. Cole. I understand
"killed" very well.

99
00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.576
Then why would you
want to keep risking
your life and Phoebe's?

100
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.880
Not to mention mine.

101
00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.280
There's a legion of
bounty hunters on my ass.

102
00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:05.382
I'm supposed to be
laying low. but instead.

103
00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:06.883
I'm out protecting you guys!

104
00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:10.041
You know what. Cole?
Next time you can stay home.

105
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.644
If you insist on taking these
suicide missions. you force me

106
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.223
to be there. because there's

107
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.059
no way in hell I am
about to let Phoebe
lose another sister.

108
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.530
Why don't you go see
who's at the door for us. okay?
Sure.

109
00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:23.800
If it's the Source.
I'll just ask him
to come back later.

110
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:27.091
We need to talk.

111
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.228
(<i> soft chuckle</i>)

112
00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:32.230
Piper. Cole's right.

113
00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:34.210
We have a system
for fighting demons.

114
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.279
and it's worked pretty well
for the last three years.

115
00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.303
I think. uh. Prue being killed

116
00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.939
counts as a pretty big
glitch in the system.

117
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.084
I know that

118
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.554
you're angry... I am angry. too.

119
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.378
Then why are you
fighting me on this?

120
00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.487
What is the problem with
getting a little proactive?

121
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.350
Because we're not ready
to get proactive.

122
00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.851
that's what's wrong with it.

123
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.432
We're barely ready for
anything right now.

124
00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:57.434
I mean. just dealing
with our everyday.

125
00:05:57.458 --> 00:05:58.990
normal lives is hard enough.

126
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.525
That is precisely the point.

127
00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:02.327
The faster we get rid
of these demons.

128
00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.796
the faster we can get back
to our everyday. normal lives.

129
00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.565
or at least
what is left of them.

130
00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:07.966
Knock. knock.

131
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.703
I. uh...

132
00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:13.137
I'm sorry to just

133
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.752
drop by without
calling.
Uh. it's okay.

134
00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:16.941
don't worry about it.

135
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.456
I don't know exactly
why I'm here.

136
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.024
I'm just kind of
having a hard time

137
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.127
being surrounded
by people and...
And not be able

138
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.753
to tell them that
you can move things
with your mind?

139
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:32.056
It does not exactly
roll off the tongue.
(<i> laughs</i>)

140
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.292
Yeah. Well. being a witch
is tough on friendships.

141
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.795
That's why the whole
sister thing comes in
so handy.

142
00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:37.929
What are you doing?

143
00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.431
PIPER:
Um...

144
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.043
it's a little chatty up here.

145
00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.802
so I'm gonna go scry
for evil in my room.

146
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.270
Scry?

147
00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.783
PIPER:
Yeah.

148
00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:49.708
uh... Phoebe will explain.

149
00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.643
I'll see you later.

150
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.081
It's kind of like a. um...

151
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.284
supernatural LoJack.

152
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.353
Well. why don't you
just use that big book?

153
00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:05.590
I mean. it is a book
of spells. right?

154
00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.559
Oh. it's a lot more than that.

155
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.194
It's kind of hard to explain.

156
00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:13.598
It looks so old.

157
00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.802
Yeah. It has
survived a lot.

158
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.515
Fortunately. it protects itself

159
00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:19.871
from evil.

160
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.173
It protects itself? How?

161
00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:23.742
Magic.

162
00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:26.978
May I?

163
00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:31.716
Yeah. Technically
it's yours. too.

164
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.329
I would walk you through it

165
00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:36.521
right now. but I have
to go talk to Cole.

166
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.190
Well. maybe I could just
take it back to my office.

167
00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.191
Oh. no. no. no.

168
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.027
No. It doesn't
leave the house.

169
00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:44.273
But just feel free

170
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.909
to thumb through it. and then

171
00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:48.493
I'll be back in a few minutes.

172
00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:59.511
This could solve
a lot of problems.

173
00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.589
What? What is it?
What's wrong?

174
00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.602
You've got to talk to your wife.

175
00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:15.126
Okay. Cole. remember what I said
about being gentle?

176
00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:16.862
What about my wife?

177
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.210
She's out of control.

178
00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.565
Cole!
What?

179
00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:23.735
It's just we're very worried
about her.

180
00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:24.970
What happened?

181
00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.905
She's very. very angry.

182
00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:29.686
Well. of course she's angry...
she's grieving.
PHOEBE:
Right.

183
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.142
And if she were punching walls.

184
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.422
I would happily call
a repairman...
The problem is.

185
00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.047
she prefers to punch demons.

186
00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:37.649
Well. I'll talk to her.

187
00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:40.396
She has no regard
for her own life.
or anyone else's.

188
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.987
She's Charles Bronson cubed.

189
00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:44.088
I said I'd talk to her.

190
00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.797
PHOEBE:
Guys. guys...

191
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.994
Who is Charles Bronson?

192
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.132
Never mind.

193
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.467
Can we please just have
a minute alone?

194
00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:59.905
Sure.
PHOEBE:
Thank you.

195
00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.143
Uh. it's not just that
she's violent. Leo;

196
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.223
she's acting nothing
like herself.

197
00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:09.948
She's completely dismissive
of Paige.

198
00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.228
(<i> sighs</i>):
and...

199
00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:14.597
I don't know what to do anymore.

200
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:15.854
Strange. isn't it?

201
00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:17.622
Now on top of everything else.

202
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:19.558
you have to play
the middle sister.

203
00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:22.761
when you've always been
the. uh...

204
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.106
Screw-up?

205
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.163
(<i> laughs</i>)

206
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.898
The youngest.

207
00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.912
Yeah. I look at Paige and Piper.

208
00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:31.414
it makes me think back
to all those times

209
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:34.851
that Piper had
to play mediator
between me and Prue.

210
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:37.075
Not a lot of fun. huh?

211
00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.811
It's not a job I
would have asked for.

212
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.214
and I'm not sure it's a job
I'm gonna be any good at.

213
00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.283
But... I just...

214
00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:48.653
I don't have time to really
worry about it right now.

215
00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.623
I'll talk to her.

216
00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:53.625
Thanks. Leo.

217
00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:56.039
Not to rush this tender moment.

218
00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:58.623
but she's already
started scrying.

219
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.999
Oh!

220
00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:05.036
I didn't mean
you couldn't use the stairs!

221
00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:24.756
Okay. book. protect yourself.

222
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:34.065
(<i> whistles</i>)

223
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.544
PHOEBE (<i> calls</i>):
Paige!

224
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.368
I'll be right up!

225
00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.938
Whoa! (<i> laughs</i>)

226
00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:41.818
Where's the fire?
Uh. you know. work.

227
00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:43.508
Lunch break's over.
Gotta go.

228
00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.655
But we didn't even get to talk.

229
00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.612
Oh. yeah.
it's all right.
Don't worry.

230
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.080
Will you come by later?

231
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.982
Sure. yeah. absolutely.

232
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.450
Bye.

233
00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.022
Bye.

234
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.624
(<i> door creaks and shuts</i>)

235
00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:02.627
Look. honey...

236
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:05.530
it isn't just that
it's dangerous.

237
00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.299
Leo. whitelighters are supposed
to guide. not judge.

238
00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:09.801
Just because I'm doing things

239
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.270
a little bit differently
doesn't mean there is a problem.

240
00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.482
Piper. I'm your husband.

241
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.217
not just your
whitelighter.
and when you

242
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.520
speak to me like that.
there<i> is</i> a problem.

243
00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:19.210
I can't help you

244
00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.179
unless you talk to me.

245
00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:25.249
It hurts to talk. Leo.

246
00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:27.652
It hurts to breathe.

247
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.654
So unless you have some idea

248
00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:33.725
of how to bring Prue back.
I don't want to talk right now.

249
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.762
Is that what you
don't want to say?

250
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.397
Is that you still blame me

251
00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.577
for not being able
to bring her back?
No. Leo.

252
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:43.501
I don't blame you.

253
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.869
I blame evil.

254
00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:47.906
Why... why do you think
I am doing all of this.

255
00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.652
for kicks?
Honestly?

256
00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.253
I think you're doing it because

257
00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:55.117
it's easier than
confronting what
you're really feeling.

258
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.253
Demon.
What?

259
00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:03.621
I have work to do.

260
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.059
Cole. Phoebe. let's go.

261
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.772
Nothing like a copy
room with a view.

262
00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:28.244
(<i> chuckles</i>):
Hey. Clearasil.
what's poppin'?

263
00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:33.930
Don't worry about him. Billy.

264
00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:35.954
He's a jerk to everybody.
Yeah. I know.

265
00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:39.791
That's why his mail
gets lost... frequently.

266
00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.573
Hey. is there something
wrong with this copier?

267
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.930
The copier?

268
00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:48.432
I don't think so.
I just ran off a whole bunch.

269
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.434
Everything keeps
coming up blank.

270
00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:53.671
Are you trying to copy a book?

271
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.906
Nah. it's nothing.

272
00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.095
It's cool.
Well. if-if you need me

273
00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:59.744
to do it for you.
just say the word.

274
00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.512
Thanks. You're sweet.

275
00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:17.361
"Let the object of objection

276
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.397
"become but a dream.

277
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.600
as I cause the seen
to be unseen."

278
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.171
(<i> groaning softly</i>)

279
00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:27.305
You okay. Billy?

280
00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:30.909
Yeah. I-I just. uh.
got a little head rush.

281
00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:38.883
(<i> quietly</i>):
Oh my. God. it worked!

282
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.923
Oh. my God!

283
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.128
Paige. is. uh. everything okay?

284
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:52.864
It will be from now on.

285
00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.073
Piper. Cole and I
do not support you in this.

286
00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.843
If you insist on doing it.
you are going in alone!

287
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.377
Okay. I'll see you at home.

288
00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:07.645
Told you that wouldn't work.

289
00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:08.925
It was worth a shot.

290
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.849
Wait a minute.
Do you smell smoke?

291
00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.250
(<i> sniffs</i>)

292
00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.751
It's in there.

293
00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:18.823
(<i> man shouts indistinctly</i>
<i>in distance</i>)

294
00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:21.392
MAN:
Stop! Stop! No!

295
00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:26.097
(<i> man shouting</i>)

296
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.726
Get back.
I'll blow it up.

297
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.349
Go on.

298
00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:33.604
(<i> muffled boom</i>)

299
00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:34.906
(<i> groans</i>)

300
00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:35.975
Uh. Piper?

301
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.076
Yeah. yeah! Crap!

302
00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:39.510
(<i> man yelling indistinctly</i>)

303
00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.079
Okay.

304
00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:44.582
(<i> yells</i>)

305
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.152
Piper!

306
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.520
Wha...?

307
00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:53.925
(<i> coughing</i>)
(<i> Piper yells</i>)

308
00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:01.132
Piper. let them go!

309
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:06.939
Uh-oh.

310
00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:15.258
Th-Th-They're immune
to my powers.

311
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:17.215
Unfortunately. Cole isn't.

312
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:19.385
(<i> yells</i>)

313
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.626
Piper. unfreeze him!

314
00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.361
What if I blow him up?

315
00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:38.403
Cole... (<i> coughs</i>)

316
00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:47.412
(<i> Piper coughing</i>)

317
00:15:57.223 --> 00:15:59.235
I'm gonna take out those
chain smoking bitches

318
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.359
if it's the last thing I do.

319
00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.306
It might be
the last thing you do.

320
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.096
That's very supportive. Cole.

321
00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:06.497
Whose side are you on?

322
00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:07.977
At the moment.
I'm on Phoebe's side.

323
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.041
(<i> coughs</i>):
Well. the last time I checked.

324
00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:11.669
Phoebe was still my sister.

325
00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.316
which technically
puts her on my side.

326
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.550
Why are we arguing?

327
00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:16.385
We're not arguing.
we're discussing.

328
00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:17.886
Piper.
you are arguing.
(<i> coughing</i>)

329
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.021
And. look. you're already hurt.

330
00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:19.978
I'm fine.

331
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.223
You can't stop coughing.

332
00:16:21.247 --> 00:16:22.491
And your control
over your powers

333
00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.449
seems to be getting
worse. not better.

334
00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:26.362
Well. our powers are
tied to our emotions.

335
00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.030
so it makes sense
that they would be

336
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.231
a little off right now.

337
00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:31.422
All the more reason to lay low.

338
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.790
These demons are dangerous.

339
00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.225
All the more reason

340
00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:35.393
to vanquish them.

341
00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:37.928
Okay. that is what we do.
eliminate evil.

342
00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.108
Regardless of the consequences.

343
00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:40.132
Now you sound like Prue.

344
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.202
Okay. Cole. I'm going to
vanquish the cancer girls

345
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.310
with or without your help.

346
00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:46.937
So either you tell me
what you know

347
00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.106
or get out of the way.

348
00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:54.412
They're called Furies.

349
00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:56.147
Like from mythology?

350
00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:57.948
The dog-faced women from hell?

351
00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.296
They're modern knock-offs.
their MO is the same though.

352
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.620
They punish evildoers?
Exactly.

353
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.866
Wait. wouldn't that
make them good?

354
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.834
Well. these Furies
have no temperance.

355
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.070
They'll go after a shoplifter
as soon as a murderer

356
00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.705
and they take great
pleasure in the kill.

357
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.729
Great.
Then we'll take great pleasure

358
00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:12.764
in the vanquish.

359
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.371
What aren't you telling us?

360
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.680
(<i> sighs heavily</i>)

361
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.108
So they go after evildoers.

362
00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:25.510
Have they attacked you before?

363
00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.326
When they focus
their thoughts on you.

364
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.760
they force you to hear the cries

365
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.064
of all your former victims.

366
00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:36.554
You're not the demon
who did those things anymore.

367
00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:41.959
(<i> Piper shrieks</i>)

368
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.112
Evil got<i> The Book of Shadows.</i>

369
00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:51.747
How did evil get
<i>The Book of Shadows?</i>

370
00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:54.272
Oh. no.
"Oh. no"?

371
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.951
Phoebe. a demon has
<i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

372
00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:57.319
"Oh. no" doesn't quite cover it.

373
00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.755
Let me go see
what I can find out.
No. wait.

374
00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.579
Uh. Piper...

375
00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.359
promise me you're not
gonna overreact.

376
00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.516
Is that even possible?

377
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.852
I think that. uh. maybe...

378
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.321
Well. it might-might

379
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.022
be feasible

380
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.591
that. uh...

381
00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:17.261
Paige borrowed<i> The Book.</i>

382
00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.699
What? Why. why. why.

383
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.312
why would you think that?!

384
00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:25.803
See. now this is what I meant
about overreacting.

385
00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.371
It's just that I...
You let

386
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.807
Paige take<i> The Book of Shadows</i>
out of the manor?

387
00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.342
Well. no. I did not let her.

388
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.878
It's just she left pretty quick
and...

389
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.158
it looks like she might have...

390
00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:37.982
Out of the window?

391
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.850
Piper. I am...

392
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.487
Phoebe. why would you even
leave her alone with it?

393
00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:44.688
Well. because she's our sister.

394
00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:47.458
Not for long.

395
00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.204
Are you coming?

396
00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:01.038
To vanquish your sister?

397
00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.040
I think I'll sit this one out.

398
00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.049
It's unbelievable.

399
00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:14.352
Maybe it was the light
from the copy machine.

400
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.232
God. this day is amazing.

401
00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:17.699
I mean you went and got cute.

402
00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.135
You think?
Totally.

403
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.836
And then my car loan
comes through.

404
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.937
like. out of nowhere.

405
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:23.739
My credit is worse than Paige's.

406
00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.829
You know. I still
can't believe all this.

407
00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.131
It's amazing.

408
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.267
Sir. I am taking
full responsibility

409
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.613
for being late
with the application.

410
00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.871
I'm simply asking
for a deadline extension.

411
00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.507
Well. I'm asking that
you not punish Adam O'Brien.

412
00:19:36.576 --> 00:19:38.654
He's already had a tough enough
life for my mistake.

413
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.911
We're working fast
to straighten this thing out.

414
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.146
Sir. all I'm saying is..

415
00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:46.784
"These words will travel
through the minds

416
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.286
"of stubborn parties and unbind

417
00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:49.831
"the thoughts too rigid
to be kind.

418
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.856
a compromise they'll
dis-entwine."

419
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.792
How does 6:00 on Friday sound?

420
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.394
6:00 Friday is perfect.

421
00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:58.529
Thank you so much.

422
00:19:58.598 --> 00:20:00.097
Victory.

423
00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.899
You got the extension?

424
00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:02.900
Yeah.

425
00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.335
Unbelievable.

426
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:05.981
You're into all that
witchy stuff. right?

427
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.805
Excuse me?

428
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.051
Well. I'm just thinking

429
00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.919
that there must be something
in the stars today.

430
00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:13.422
I mean Billy's face.
my car. now this.

431
00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:15.658
Is there a full moon
or something?

432
00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:18.249
I don't know.
but whatever it is.

433
00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.758
I'm gonna call
my student loan sharks

434
00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:20.985
and take full advantage of it.

435
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.387
Ooh. good.
Me. too.

436
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:26.657
You know. Paige...

437
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.527
as a lawyer.

438
00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:31.507
I could get those
nasty creditors

439
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:34.076
off your back so easily.

440
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.178
And if you can't
afford to pay me.

441
00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:38.936
I could always just
take it out in trade.

442
00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.972
Or I could just sue your ass
for sexual harassment

443
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:44.342
and pay you with my big
fat punitive settlement.

444
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:47.445
The way you dress?

445
00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:49.680
The judge would admire
my restraint.

446
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.416
That's it.

447
00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:01.492
Perfect. I'll just change
"demon" to "dirtbag."

448
00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:04.462
I don't understand how
someone can be that stupid.

449
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.490
I don't understand why
you haven't stopped ranting

450
00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:08.031
since we left the house.

451
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.411
You're right. you're right.

452
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.368
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.969
Yes. Paige made a mistake.

454
00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:13.081
A mistake?!

455
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.316
She stole from us.

456
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.740
She borrowed.
Borrowed.

457
00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:18.542
She... she threw
our family heritage

458
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.910
out of the window.

459
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:22.380
Well. that's because
we never took the time

460
00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.248
to explain its significance.

461
00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:25.683
It was just a book to her.

462
00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.630
Okay. Phoebe.
it's not just a book.

463
00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:30.588
it's like... it-it-it is
like part of our family.

464
00:21:30.657 --> 00:21:33.223
(<i> coughs</i>)

465
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.725
Paige is not a killer.

466
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.126
She didn't kill anyone.

467
00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:38.596
And she's not a demon that
we're on our way to vanquish.

468
00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.008
I get that. Phoebe.
Do you?

469
00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:41.432
Because I don't think
that you do.

470
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:42.544
(<i> coughs</i>)
You all right?

471
00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:44.747
Hey! Get away
from me!

(<i> clamoring</i>)

473
00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:49.206
Who's your mama?
What the hell is going on?

474
00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:50.275
It's not funny!

475
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.976
Give Mama some sugar!

476
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.845
Whoo! Who's the man?!

477

478
00:21:57.216 --> 00:21:57.981
You...

479

are so...

480
00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:04.922
busted.

481
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.324
Hello.

482
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.293
You stole our sacred book

483
00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:12.763
so you could perform magical
plastic surgery on yourself?!

484
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.276
You think I did this on purpose?

485
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.860
My body was perfectly fine
just as it was. thank you.

486
00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:18.836
DONNIE:
I mean it.
get away from me!

487
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:23.741
Piper. you could have
just blown up

488
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.943
a dozen innocent people.
I took a chance.

489
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.045
See. are you listening
to yourself?

490
00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.124
What happened?

491
00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:31.460
I don't know. they just grew.

492
00:22:31.484 --> 00:22:32.628
Oh. right.

493
00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:34.330
and you had
nothing to do with that.

494
00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:36.253
Did you cast any spells?

495
00:22:36.322 --> 00:22:38.622
One.

496
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.925
Five.
Five?!

497
00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:44.928
Okay. what did you do
just before

498
00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:46.263
you turned into Betty Boop?

499
00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:49.467
Well. I cast a spell on
the slimeball I work with

500
00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:52.536
so I could give him a taste
of his own medicine.

501
00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:54.365
Uh-huh.
That the slimeball?

502
00:22:57.844 --> 00:22:59.543
And that's the backfire.

503
00:22:59.612 --> 00:23:01.645
Backfire?

504
00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:04.382
You misused magic to make him
the object of ogling.

505
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.762
and the spell backfired
and did the same thing to you.

506
00:23:06.786 --> 00:23:09.319
Which you would have learned
if you had bothered to ask.

507
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:10.866
but now instead
of vanquishing demons.

508
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.450
we're gonna have to spend
the afternoon fixing your mess.

509
00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:16.460
Okay. Piper. call Leo

510
00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.497
and get him to orb
this slimeball back home.

511
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.565
We have to protect him
until we can figure out

512
00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:22.966
a way to reverse the spell.

513
00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:25.803
Paige and I will grab
<i>The Book</i> and meet you there.

514
00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:37.948
PAIGE:
<i>Are my boobs gonna</i>
<i>stay this way forever?</i>

515
00:23:38.017 --> 00:23:40.451
Not if I can ever
find the spell.

516
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.219
What about Piper?

517
00:23:42.288 --> 00:23:44.132
She gonna stay
mad at me forever?

518
00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:45.623
No.

519
00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:47.758
It's just. um...

520
00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:49.927
she hasn't really
been herself lately.

521
00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:52.830
You know. a lot of ups and downs

522
00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:55.933
since Prue. you know.
like us all.

523
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:58.480
The last thing I wanted
to do was to add to

524
00:23:58.504 --> 00:23:59.637
you guys' stress.

525
00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:01.517
I just wanted
to get back at Donnie.

526
00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:04.542
Yeah. and I understand
the temptation. Paige.
I really do.

527
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.811
But I told you.<i> The Book</i>
does not leave the house.

528
00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:08.011
Right.

529
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.080
Sorry.

530
00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.314

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.716
My boobs are in the way.

532
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:15.163
Can you put it
into third for me?

533
00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.187
All right.

534
00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:17.855
Ready? Here we go.

535
00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:19.790
(<i> tires screech</i>)
All right.

536
00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:22.037
Did you find the spell yet?

537
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:23.226
No. but I...

538
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.529
found the demons.

539
00:24:25.598 --> 00:24:26.864
Oh. my God.

540
00:24:26.933 --> 00:24:28.209
What? You can't
say "demons"

541
00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:29.344
followed by
"Oh. my God."

542
00:24:29.368 --> 00:24:31.112
I'm new at this.
I'm likely to panic.

543
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.736
Okay. Uh...

544
00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:35.072
Fury smoke kills
bad guys. right?

545
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.239
But in good people.

546
00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.176
it looks for a portal
of unexpressed fury.

547
00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.288
And?

548
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.714
It builds until it
consumes your humanity

549
00:24:43.783 --> 00:24:45.816
and turns you into a Fury.

550
00:24:45.885 --> 00:24:48.218
Um... we fought
the Furies today.

551
00:24:48.287 --> 00:24:50.020
Piper got smoked.

552
00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:51.522
Wait.

553
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:53.469
Are you saying that Piper's
turning into a demon?

554
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:56.494
It wouldn't be the first time.

555
00:24:56.562 --> 00:24:58.061
Uh. step on it
and hit the clutch.

556
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.062
I'm going into fourth.
Ready?

557
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:01.064
On three.
One. two. three.

558
00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:05.268
Oh!

559
00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.037
Easy. Piper.

560
00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:08.506
What. are you
protecting him now?

561
00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:10.574
What the hell is going on?

562
00:25:10.643 --> 00:25:12.510
And what's with the chicks?
They've gone crazy.

563
00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:14.845
This "chick"
just saved your ass.

564
00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:16.213
you sniveling ingrate.

565
00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.548
Do...

566
00:25:17.617 --> 00:25:18.916
Do you see what I mean?

567
00:25:18.985 --> 00:25:21.385
Who said you could get up?

568
00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.286
(<i> yells. groans</i>)

569
00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.800
What's the matter with you?

570
00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:25.923
Oh. my God.

571
00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:27.068
Okay. honey. look.

572
00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:28.303
I don't know what's going on.

573
00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:29.771
but we really need to talk.

574
00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:32.530
Leo. you know what?

575
00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:34.131
I'm sick of talking.

576
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.149
Now we really need to talk.

577
00:25:41.173 --> 00:25:44.107
Piper. you do not use
your powers on a mortal.

578
00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:45.420
do you hear me?

579
00:25:45.444 --> 00:25:49.284
COLE:
Back away slowly.
Leo.

580
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:50.213
What?

581
00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.983
She's becoming a Fury.

582
00:25:56.022 --> 00:25:57.942
There's no reasoning
with her now.

583
00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:01.224
Piper. you're a good witch.
do you hear me?!

584
00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:02.392
Fight this.

585
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.037
Oh. God. help! Ah!

586
00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.506
No!

587
00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:22.339
PHOEBE:
Cole!

588
00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:24.514
I... Well...

589
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.185
That wasn't very nice.

590
00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.999
Cole hit her with
an energy ball!

591
00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:43.367
Leo. it was a low voltage.

592
00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.046
Would you prefer he'd let
her kill an innocent?

593
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.271
I'd prefer that he wouldn't use
his demonic powers on my wife!

594
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.685
I can't believe that you
let him go look for her.

595
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.142
Oh. this is all my fault.

596
00:26:52.211 --> 00:26:54.155
I shouldn't have stolen
the Book of Shadows.

597
00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:55.778
You stole the Book of Shadows?!

598
00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:58.148
Leo. Leo. concentrate. please.

599
00:26:58.217 --> 00:26:59.361
I just hope he finds her fast.

600
00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:00.583
because if this is anything

601
00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.320
like the time
I turned into a banshee.

602
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:04.854
she's going to be hungry
for a kill.

603
00:27:04.923 --> 00:27:06.201
I'm sorry. a banshee?

604
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.691
Yeah. a demonic screamer.
kind of trampy. feeds on pain.

605
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.928
I think I need to sit down.

606
00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:13.096
Whoa!

607
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.403
Whoa.

608
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:21.338
Paige!

609
00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:22.572
What?

610
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.685
You only said I couldn't
use magic to punish him.

611
00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:26.109
Okay. Leo...

612
00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:27.555
you orb Donnie back
to his office.

613
00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:28.978
heal him there and then

614
00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:30.525
make sure that he doesn't nark
us out for being witches.

615
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:31.848
How?

616
00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:33.395
I don't know!
Be creative.

617
00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:34.884
What about Piper?

618
00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:37.020
You have to do your job.
and let us do ours.

619
00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:39.889
We'll get your wife back.

620
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:40.958
I promise.

621
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:48.731
(<i> Phoebe sighs)</i>

622
00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:51.879
Um. I hate to ask.

623
00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:54.182
but how are we going
to get his wife back?

624
00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:56.806
I mean. she's kind
of a full-on demon.

625
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.309
No. she's not full-on.
she doesn't have the talons yet.

626
00:27:59.378 --> 00:28:01.244
That probably comes
with the first kill.

627
00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:04.081
Besides. if we were
able to save her

628
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.582
when she turned
into a wendigo...

629
00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.794
A wendi what?

630
00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:09.886
Um... a wendigo.

631
00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:11.788
It's kind of like a werewolf.

632
00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.356
only meaner.

633
00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:16.893
Is this the spell that you used?

634
00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:18.661
Uh-huh.

635
00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:23.766
Is there some sort of spell
I could do. you know. in advance

636
00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:26.002
so I could not become
maybe a banshee or...

637
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.004
What word did you
sub demon with?

638
00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.606
Dirtbag.

639
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.809
Dirtbag.

640
00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:42.119
Okay.

641
00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:45.288
Hand.

642
00:28:45.357 --> 00:28:47.257
Guided spirits.

643
00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.858
hear our plea.

644
00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:53.163
Annul this magic. let it be.

645
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.697
Please let it be!

646
00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:04.707
Oh... do you think it worked
a little too well?

647
00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.113
Stop!

648
00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.848
(<i> snarling</i>)

649
00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:20.557
(<i> echoing voices shouting</i>)

650
00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:47.651
I've been looking for you.

651
00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.657
Damn it.

652
00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:54.957
Why isn't it working?

653
00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.937
Because Piper isn't a witch
anymore.

654
00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.496
Can't you just scry
for evil. then?

655
00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:01.476
Do you have any idea
how much evil

656
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.060
is running around San Francisco?

657
00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:06.636
Damn it. Piper.

658
00:30:08.674 --> 00:30:09.739
Whoa.

659
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:12.075
Cole. thank God...

660
00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.910
Don't thank him yet.

661
00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:15.078
You didn't find her?

662
00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.580
I didn't get a chance to look.

663
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:18.293
Every time I used
my sensing powers.

664
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:19.482
a bounty hunter sensed me.

665
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.951
I fought off three of them.

666
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.186
I'm sorry.

667
00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:24.688
No... it's... it's okay.

668
00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.756
Somehow everything is going

669
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:27.957
to be okay.

670
00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.626
I... I don't have

671
00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:31.027
even a little idea

672
00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:33.040
how everything's going
to be okay...

673
00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:34.130
Phoebe...

674
00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:35.910
You know why? Because nothing
is okay.

675
00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.100
Phoebe...

676
00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.436
My sister is a Fury.
my boyfriend is a demon...

677
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:40.648
Oh. baby. you're bleeding.

678
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.372
Phoebe!

679
00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:45.375
Didn't you say you found me
because Piper cast a spell

680
00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:47.143
to find a lost witch?

681
00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:51.013
Yes. but I also said that
Piper's not a witch anymore.

682
00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:54.884
Yes. but if I could substitute
the word dirtbag for demon.

683
00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:57.031
why can't we substitute
the word sister for witch?

684
00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.122
Would that work?

685
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.892
Well. no. not if she's already
looking for a kill.

686
00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:04.272
The call won't be strong enough.

687
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:05.495
Why not?

688
00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:06.963
Because of the pull of evil.

689
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.576
When I was possessed
by the Woogie.

690
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.966
the bloodlust was so strong...

691
00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:11.234
Woogie?

692
00:31:11.303 --> 00:31:12.335
Don't ask.

693
00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:14.504
The point is.

694
00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:17.133
I don't think she'll
answer the call.

695
00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:21.778
Then we'll add bait.

696
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.752
No.

697
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.019
No... no.

698
00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.921
Are you kidding me. no!

699
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.950
The Furies go after
evildoers. right?

700
00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:38.895
Paige. we are not using
the love of my life as bait!

701
00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.430
Oh. yes. we are.

702
00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:41.598
It's perfect.

703
00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:45.435
Cole. you have been
a demon for over a century.

704
00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:46.969
That is a lot of victims.

705
00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.172
The pain of their cries alone
can kill you.

706
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.752
Yes. but as you said.
I'm not the demon

707
00:31:50.776 --> 00:31:51.708
who did those things anymore.

708
00:31:51.777 --> 00:31:53.443
And if facing my crimes

709
00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:55.111
helps save your sister...

710
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.220
Cole..
Phoebe!

711
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.788
I would do almost anything
for you. you know that.

712
00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.756
But I will not be a coward

713
00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:08.785
for you.
please don't ask me to be.

714
00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.867
We'll need some of your blood.

715
00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.869
Right.

716
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.838

PHOEBE AND PAIGE:
Power of the sisters rise.

718

Course unseen across the skies.

719
00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:37.420
Come to us who call you near.

00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:39.789

<i>Blood to blood. return to me.</i>

723
00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:52.335
I know where evil dwells.

724
00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.409
You sure about this?

725
00:32:59.478 --> 00:33:02.746
I'm good at a lot of things.
waiting is not one of them.

726

(<i> Paige grunts</i>)

727
00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:06.861
Honey. what are you doing?

728
00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:08.763
I'm trying
to do that orb thingy.

729
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:11.287
I can't seem
to get the hang of it though.

730

(<i> yells</i>)

731
00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:16.860
What happened?

732
00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:17.861
You orbed.

733
00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.128
I did?

734
00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:20.963
It's a fear response.
So until
you learn

735
00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.977
how to control it.
you just have to...

736
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:23.833
Get scared?

737
00:33:23.902 --> 00:33:25.201
Pretty much.

738
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.604
All right.

739
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.939
Well. that shouldn't
be too difficult.

740
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.608
Good.
Then we will orb.

741
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.010
we will levitate. we will
juggle knives if we have to.

742
00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.279
just to keep the Furies
distracted from Cole.

743
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.658
Okay. but what I don't get

744
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.727
is how we un-demon Piper
once she gets here.

745
00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:43.119
Well. we have to close
the portal of unexpressed fury.

746
00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:46.188
Unexpressed? I think she's
been raging for days.

747
00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:47.668
That's 'cause there's
something she's not saying.

748

Which is?

749
00:33:48.427 --> 00:33:49.893
I don't know.

750
00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.795

Paige!

754
00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:05.876
I did it again.

755

that Prue died.

You blame me. just admit it.

who abandoned you. It's Prue!

To what Piper's really angry at.

Tell her. Piper.

You should hate her.

When my parents died.
I hated them for it.

about what would happen

than I have in a while.

It's just really. really quiet.

Prue was always the first
one up and the last one down.

It's strange
the things that you miss.

well. Paige...

She completely freaked?

00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:37.680
No. She handled it.

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:40.549
Better than most
people would. I think.

I miss Prue so much.

opening up to someone else.

831
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.309
With everything that
happens in our lives.

832
00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:11.114
love just feels like
an invitation for more pain.

833
00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:21.390
So maybe. um...

834
00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:24.019
maybe you don't start with love.

835
00:39:25.263 --> 00:39:27.823
Maybe you just
start with thanks.

Busy work.
I'm best in the kitchen.

840
00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:05.634
Prue was the one
that liked to. uh. chase demons.

Man. he's like
a whole new Donnie.

842
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:16.946
What did Leo say to him?

Um... I don't know.

He's a miracle worker.
that husband of mine.

845

So. how are you?

846
00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:37.733
I've had bad hours.

847
00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:42.004
and hours
that aren't quite so bad.

848
00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:46.075
I guess you know how it is.

849
00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:48.577
Yeah.

850

When my parents died.

851
00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:54.150
there were some days I didn't
think I'd survive the sadness.

852
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.555
It'll never be okay
that she's gone. Piper.

853
00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.858
But I promise
it will get better.

854
00:41:05.864 --> 00:41:08.564
You know.
Leo could fix that for you.

855
00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:11.167
Oh. it's my first war wound.

856
00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:12.902
Think I'll wear it with pride.

857
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:16.839
Unfortunately. in this family.
it will not be the last.

858
00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:21.043
Well. every family
has its pros and its cons.

859
00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:24.080
A couple of demon battles
in exchange for the power

860
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.481
to clear up my friend's skin.

861
00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.760
I'd say it's worth it.

862
00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.184
The power to what?

863
00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:34.023

He's cute.
isn't he?

864
00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:36.237
You should have
seen him yesterday.

865
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:39.929
Okay. uh. you saved my life.

866
00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:43.299
so I guess we're even
on the Book of Shadows swipe.

867
00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:45.768

to being a witch.

869
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:51.140
Rules that you will have
to learn and follow.

870
00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:52.808
Well. not to be difficult.

871
00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:55.422
but you're married
to our whitelighter

872
00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.479
and Phoebe's

873
00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.415
shacking up with a demon.

874
00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:02.851
so on balance.
maybe my friend can stay cute?

875
00:42:02.921 --> 00:42:06.822
Okay.

That pile looks
about the same size

878

as it did about an hour ago.

879
00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.131
Oh. that was my fault.

880
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.498
I distracted her with muffins.

881
