It could be like you're texting

Yes. Vada?

56
00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.821
Does the kind of rock affect
how long the aquifer last

Oh. that's a great question.

62

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.378

to the recent ice age.

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:11.903
Are your dads really chill?

350
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:18.368
They travel a lot though. huh?

351
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:19.702
Mostly. Europe.

352
00:26:20.411 --> 00:26:21.663
For like fun?

353
00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.415
Work.

354
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:26.042
Do they send people
to spy on you

355
00:26:26.125 --> 00:26:29.337
or they trust you just to not
throw a bunch of ragers.

356
00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:36.177
I mean. they know I'm not
like a rager person. so.

357
00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:39.055
Who do you hang out
with at school?

358
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:41.140
Like...

359
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:44.561
Like different people.

360
00:26:45.728 --> 00:26:47.438
Like a bunch
of different people. so.

361
00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:51.067
I'm gone a lot with dance.

362
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.236
How often do you dance?

363
00:26:54.028 --> 00:26:55.738
Every day.

364
00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:57.073
Like classes?

365
00:26:57.156 --> 00:26:58.324
Mmm-hmm.

366
00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:02.579
But I haven't gone

367
00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:05.415
since the thing.

368
00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.090
Are your parents chill?

369
00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:19.304
My dad more than my mom.
for sure.

370
00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:22.724
- My mom's like very white and anxious.
- [chuckles]

371
00:27:24.475 --> 00:27:26.603
I don't really tell 'em
anything though. 'cause like

372
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.354
they worry.

373
00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:34.068
I feel kinda bad for it.
They're actually really good parents.

374
00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:40.908
[Joe] <i>I see you're packing</i>
<i>for a trip.</i>

375
00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.243
<i>What's your favorite
country to visit?</i>

376
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.536
<i>Paris.</i>

377
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.330
[Joe] What's the last country
you visited?

378
00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:46.748
<i>Europe.</i>

379
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.333
[Joe] <i>What country</i>
<i>do you wish to visit?</i>

380
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:49.542
[John] <i>Persia.</i>

381
00:27:51.377 --> 00:27:53.838
[Joe] <i>What's the weirdest word</i>
<i>in the English language?</i>

382
00:27:53.921 --> 00:27:56.215
[John] <i>Moist. Yuck.</i>

383
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:57.675
[Joe] <i>When was</i>
<i>the last time you cried?</i>

384
00:28:01.387 --> 00:28:02.680
Can you stay?

385
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:06.976
It's late.

386
00:28:08.102 --> 00:28:09.604
Just till I fall asleep.

387
00:28:14.108 --> 00:28:15.109
Okay.

388
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.195
Thanks.

389
00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:24.327
[Joe] <i>What's your</i>
<i>favorite movie?</i>

390
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.370
[John] <i>Mmm. Pizza.</i>

391
00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:27.288
[Joe] <i>Favorite TV show?</i>

392
00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.499
[John] <i>Um. I would have to
say my pilot with Kate Berlant</i>

393
00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:31.459
<i>that was passed on by every major
network and streaming platform.</i>

394
00:28:31.542 --> 00:28:33.628
<i>Meanwhile. rapists everywhere
continue to freely make up 10.</i>

395
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:34.962
[Nick] <i>What up. bitch?</i>

396
00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:37.215
Dude. I'm so sorry I missed
the march.

397
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:40.468
I mean. it's fine.
I was just. like. legit worried about you.

398
00:28:40.551 --> 00:28:42.345
<i>It was cool. though.
They let me speak.</i>

399
00:28:42.428 --> 00:28:45.223
I wish you'd been there.
but it's fine. I'll send you a link.

400
00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:47.850
I know. I'm sorry.
I just...

401
00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:50.561
It's a long story.
but I ended up goin' to Mia's house and...

402
00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:52.522
Wait. lol. Mia Reed?

403
00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.524
What?

404
00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:55.942
[Vada] <i>Yeah.</i>

405
00:28:56.025 --> 00:29:00.321
She... She's just been alone
and I feel bad.

406
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:04.367
- So I just...
- No. no. no. I mean. it's fine. It's just like random.

407
00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:05.618
Is she okay?

408
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:07.161
[Vada] <i>I mean. she will be.</i>

409
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.373
Are you okay?

410
00:29:10.456 --> 00:29:11.416
Yeah.

411
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:13.459
Just tired.

412
00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:19.173
[Nick on video] <i>We wanna know
how a 16-year-old can have access</i>

413
00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:22.593
<i>to a military assault rifle
and that's considered okay?</i>

414
00:29:22.677 --> 00:29:24.595
- <i>It's not okay!</i>
- [people cheering on video]

415
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:26.472
<i>We want change.</i>

416
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:29.642
<i>We deserve to feel safe going
to our own school every day...</i>

417
00:29:43.823 --> 00:29:45.241
[gasps]

418
00:29:45.324 --> 00:29:47.452
[panting]

419
00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:56.127
It feels like so soon.
It's been like two weeks.

420
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.545
[Nick] <i>No. I hear you.</i>

421
00:29:57.628 --> 00:29:59.255
<i>It's... It's intense.
but I just...</i>

422
00:29:59.338 --> 00:30:02.008
<i>I don't want us to be ruled
by fear. you know?</i>

423
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:03.926
<i>I feel like it'll be less scary
if we were together.</i>

424
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.178
I gotta go.

425
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:06.262
[Nick]
Okay. love you. Call me later.

426
00:30:06.345 --> 00:30:07.805
Hey! Honey. can I come in?

427
00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:10.099
You don't have to ask
to come in. Mom.

428
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:12.643
Okay.

429
00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:16.731
So it sounds like Nick's going
back today. huh?

430
00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:19.984
Yup. He is.

431
00:30:20.067 --> 00:30:21.986
Well...

432
00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:23.946
Well. as long
as you wanna stay home.

433
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.326
you know.
your dad and I support that.

434
00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:29.368
Thank you.

435
00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:36.000
There's just one thing.

436
00:30:42.548 --> 00:30:44.467
[Anna] Were you tired a lot
before the incident?

437
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.261
[chuckles]

438
00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.846
LOL.

439
00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.600
You called it "the incident".

440
00:30:52.683 --> 00:30:54.936
Um...

441
00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:57.647
No. I guess I'm just
always tired.

442
00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.899
I mean. I guess. that's what
caffeine is for.

443
00:30:59.982 --> 00:31:01.192
Right?

444
00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:05.196
What do you do
when you get tired?

445
00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:07.740
Sleep for like
14 hours straight.

446
00:31:07.824 --> 00:31:10.117
Ooh. I really like watching
early seasons

447
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.244
of the <i>Kardashians.</i>

448
00:31:11.327 --> 00:31:13.079
The OG Hidden Hills shit.

449
00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:16.207
That is my vibe!

450
00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:26.551
What's this. you're just
gonna fax that to my mom or...

451
00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:28.970
- Fax?
- [Vada] Yes. Fax.

452
00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.514
What are you. a time traveler
from the '80s?

453
00:31:31.597 --> 00:31:33.099
[laughs]

454
00:31:33.182 --> 00:31:36.644
I mean. I had my suspicions
when I saw those sneakers.

455
00:31:36.727 --> 00:31:39.230
but now I'm pretty convinced.

456
00:31:39.313 --> 00:31:41.107
Touche.

457
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.150
Touche.

458
00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:46.821
Look. I know this whole
therapy thing is weird

459
00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:48.322
and can be uncomfortable.

460
00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:50.449
But everything that you say
in here is confidential.

461
00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:53.452
And. side note. I actually do
really like your shoes.

462
00:31:53.536 --> 00:31:55.371
They're very cool.

463
00:31:55.454 --> 00:31:58.040
No. I know. Thank you.

464
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.627
Are there things that you don't
feel comfortable talking

465
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:05.381
to your parents about that
maybe you wanna share with me?

466
00:32:11.178 --> 00:32:12.430
Yeah.

467
00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:16.434
My porn addiction.

468
00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:18.352
Okay.

469
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.898
I'm so sorry. I'm...

470
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:23.482
[laughs] When I get nervous.

471
00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:25.776
I make really inappropriate
jokes. so. my bad.

472
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.904
You don't have to be sorry.

473
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:29.655
And you don't
have to be nervous.

474
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.660
Well. I know that my parents
are worried about me

475
00:32:34.744 --> 00:32:36.996
and they think I need help.

476
00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:39.874
But I get it.
and that's fine.

477
00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:42.460
but I personally am fine.

478
00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:46.172
Like I feel like I'm really
good at managing my emotions.

479
00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:47.298
It's...

480
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:50.092
What do you mean by that?

481
00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:53.971
I'm just very chill.

482
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:56.140
Like a very low-key person.

483
00:32:56.223 --> 00:32:59.894
So when it comes to emotional
stuff or drama I'm like

484
00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:03.272
"Okay. is this
really productive?"

485
00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:06.859
Yeah. I get it.

486
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:09.070
But you know. just because...

487
00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:12.573
It doesn't necessarily mean
that someone's being dramatic

488
00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.992
because they're emotional.

489
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.452
You know. for a lot of people.

490
00:33:16.535 --> 00:33:18.037
they need to fully experience
their emotions.

491
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.373
in order to process
what they've been through.

492
00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:22.667
so that they can begin to heal.

493
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.419
It's actually really healthy
to show your emotion.

494
00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.012
I know most people
come in here crying

495
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.681
about their cheating husbands.

496
00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:38.724
Vada. I wanna talk about you.

497
00:33:40.267 --> 00:33:42.353
I wanna know how that
shooting at your school

498
00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:43.813
has made you feel.

499
00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.986
I feel...

500
00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:54.115
[sighs]

501
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.035
It's okay.

502
00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.453
I mean. it makes sense.

503
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.334
I want you to track
how you're feeling

504
00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:07.628
using this worksheet.

505
00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.547
So there's questions on there
that'll guide you.

506
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.048
You don't have to overthink it.

507
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:12.925
it's just basically there to
hold space for you to...

508
00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:16.470
To understand whatever
emotions may come up.

509
00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:19.765
All you have to do
is try and feel.

510
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:20.975
That's it.

511
00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:23.102
No matter what
those feelings are.

512
00:34:23.185 --> 00:34:26.439
Then you can bring it back next
session and we'll go through it.

513
00:34:26.522 --> 00:34:28.315
Or you know.
you can fax it to me!

514
00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.567
If that's easier for you.

515
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.825
[Patricia] She said you were incredibly
bright. and smart. and funny.

516
00:34:37.908 --> 00:34:40.202
[Veda] Wait.
is she in love with me?

517
00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:42.079
Oh. what's the point of
goin' to therapy.

518
00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:44.248
if they're just gonna tell their
parents everything they said after?

519
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:45.958
Honey. she didn't
tell me anything.

520
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:48.252
She gave me a general assessment
of how the session went.

521
00:34:48.335 --> 00:34:50.296
- That's all.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.535
Anything?

1036
01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:08.748
Okay.

1037
01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:13.336
Let's say this.
Let's say you die tomorrow.

1038
01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.296
Okay?

1039
01:01:15.379 --> 01:01:18.674
And what if you die sad. 'cause you
regret not saying what you wanted to say?

1040
01:01:21.093 --> 01:01:22.345
Then what?

1041
01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.314
I can't say it.

1042
01:01:33.397 --> 01:01:34.857
Why?

1043
01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:11.268
Is this okay?

1044
01:02:16.482 --> 01:02:23.280
[somber music playing]

1045
01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.165
[coughing]

1046
01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:36.979
[Carlos] Where have you been?

1047
01:03:37.062 --> 01:03:38.939
We've been freaking out!

1048
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:40.483
I was at Nick's.

1049
01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:43.527
Nick's been calling all morning
wondering where you are.

1050
01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.157
Vada. your phone was dead.

1051
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.575
We didn't know if something
terrible had happened to you or...

1052
01:03:49.658 --> 01:03:53.204
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

1053
01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:55.539
The perfect child
tells a fat one.

1054
01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:57.500
She better lose screen time
for that one. Dad.

1055
01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.251
[Carlos] Vada. come back here!

1056
01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.420
Vada!

1057
01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.965
I told you.
you don't have to know!

1058
01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:06.759
- Vada
- Vada. don't be rude.

1059
01:04:06.842 --> 01:04:09.011
Vada. what were you doing
last night?

1060
01:04:09.094 --> 01:04:11.472
Nothing. Jesus!

1061
01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:13.182
Are you...
Are you seeing someone?

1062
01:04:13.265 --> 01:04:15.643
LOL. seeing someone. No!

1063
01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:17.853
Uh. I'll do it...
I'll do it.

1064
01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:23.943
If you're gonna be
spending the night

1065
01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.152
at someone's house. Vada...

1066
01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:28.322
[squeals] I'm not
having sex. Mom!

1067
01:04:28.405 --> 01:04:30.574
- Okay.
- Oh. my God!

1068
01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:32.117
What are you doing?

1069
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:40.709
Last night. I slept over
at my friend Mia's house

1070
01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.920
- and I got drunk.
- You got drunk?

1071
01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:45.589
Yeah. Mom. I got drunk.

1072
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.509
I am 16 years old
and I drink alcohol.

1073
01:04:48.592 --> 01:04:50.928
and here's the thing.
I don't even like drinking.

1074
01:04:51.011 --> 01:04:53.222
I was just tryin' to live
in the moment.

1075
01:04:53.305 --> 01:04:56.517
and feel shit. and YOLO
or something. okay?

1076
01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:08.112
[burps] Now if you excuse me.
I am hungover as shit

1077
01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:10.072
and I'm gonna go barf
in the shower.

1078
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.660
Who's Mia?

1079
01:05:14.743 --> 01:05:16.203
Who's Mia?

1080
01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:31.385
I'm not even tryin' to be rude.
I'm just...

1081
01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:33.387
I'm super busy
and I don't have the time.

1082
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:34.847
So.

1083
01:05:35.848 --> 01:05:37.182
Okay.

1084
01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:42.605
I'm sorry
I never called you back.

1085
01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:45.316
but you didn't have
to get me in trouble. dude.

1086
01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:47.318
Vada. I was just
worried about you.

1087
01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:48.569
When I didn't hear back
from you.

1088
01:05:48.652 --> 01:05:49.987
I felt like I had to call
your mom.

1089
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.405
'cause the last time
I had seen you.

1090
01:05:51.488 --> 01:05:53.866
you had literally done drugs
at school.

1091
01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.409
So I was like. "Okay. cool.

1092
01:05:55.492 --> 01:05:58.454
Maybe she's like having
a serotonin drop from hell

1093
01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:02.708
and she's like suicidal
on a bridge somewhere and...

1094
01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:04.960
Then to hear like how freaked
your family was all night.

1095
01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.420
I just...

1096
01:06:06.503 --> 01:06:08.297
I don't know. I hoped that

1097
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.466
whatever you went and did was worth
everything you put them through.

1098
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:12.301
But. you know what?

1099
01:06:12.384 --> 01:06:14.136
I'm guessing uh. it's more likely
you were with Mia Reed somewhere.

1100
01:06:14.219 --> 01:06:16.138
acting like nothing happened.

1101
01:06:16.221 --> 01:06:19.141
Why're you being like this?

1102
01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:21.769
Because I've
waited for you. Vada.

1103
01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:26.690
For a month.
I've given you space and love to heal.

1104
01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.651
But I've been dealing with this
my own way!

1105
01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:31.820
You haven't dealt with
anything. that's the problem!

1106
01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:34.073
All I wanna do is try
my hardest to stop this

1107
01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.491
from ever happening again.

1108
01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:39.703
Like why is that so hard
for you to understand?

1109
01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:41.997
That's not fucking fair. Nick.

1110
01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:44.333
None of this is fair. Vada.

1111
01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.714
Yeah. yeah.
Mmm-hmm. go be with Mia.

1112
01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.133
She's gonna save the world
with her hot ass.

1113
01:06:53.217 --> 01:06:54.510
Fuck you. Nick.

1114
01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:55.511
Wow.

1115
01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.347
Nice.

1116
01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:04.520
He's just hurtin'.
I think we all are.

1117
01:07:04.603 --> 01:07:08.816
He was so cruel about it!

1118
01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:11.694
Yeah. but you know.
he's under a lot of pressure.

1119
01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:13.153
He has to be the face of this.

1120
01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:17.700
just act brave. but. well.
he's scared. too.

1121
01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:19.535
You know.
fear makes people act crazy.

1122
01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.831
Okay. I...

1123
01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:25.791
Like I'm sorry for like

1124
01:07:25.874 --> 01:07:28.252
calling you and dumping
all of this on you.

1125
01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:32.297
especially. because it's
been the hardest on you.

1126
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.924
It's hard on everyone.

1127
01:07:37.594 --> 01:07:40.639
I think for me. you know.
when it hurts too much.

1128
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.810
I think about
how this can't be for nothing.

1129
01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:46.937
Like. oh. we won't even let
this be for not... Like. it...

1130
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.647
It can't be for nothing.
you know?

1131
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.941
Fuck. Yeah.

1132
01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.532
Tell me about your brother.

1133
01:08:03.537 --> 01:08:05.247
I just wanna know
more about him.

1134
01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:13.130
He was. uh. real quiet

1135
01:08:13.213 --> 01:08:14.548
when you first met him.

1136
01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:18.635
He watched everything now.
you know.

1137
01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.095
Like. he'd be like.

1138
01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:21.764
"Oh. that girl is gonna go home
with that guy

1139
01:08:21.847 --> 01:08:23.891
and that guy is gonna go home
with that girl and..."

1140
01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:26.977
Like. he was always right.

1141
01:08:27.061 --> 01:08:29.063
He was funny.

1142
01:08:29.146 --> 01:08:31.899
Like always making me laugh.

1143
01:08:36.528 --> 01:08:37.821
He. uh...

1144
01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.575
He sounds dope.

1145
01:08:47.664 --> 01:08:49.958
I feel him.

1146
01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:53.962
Now I know this sounds crazy
to say like...

1147
01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:57.382
I just...
I know he's still with me.

1148
01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.468
He's not gonna let me
go back and be sad.

1149
01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:02.805
he's not gonna let me go
forward and freak out.

1150
01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.724
He keeps me here.

1151
01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.726
He keeps me calm.

1152
01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:12.898
I think he's definitely
still here.

1153
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:16.860
Lot of people
don't ask me about him.

1154
01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:21.031
They think I'mma like
cry or somethin'.

1155
01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:24.493
Um. well. thank you.

1156
01:09:29.623 --> 01:09:32.292
You can always talk
about him around me.

1157
01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:40.634
[somber music playing]

1158
01:09:49.434 --> 01:09:51.687
Wait. wait.
I'm sorry. I...

1159
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.022
What's wrong?

1160
01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:57.276
I'm just going through a lot
right now. it's just...

1161
01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:00.028
I just don't know if I'm in
the right headspace right now.

1162
01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:04.575
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. my God.

1163
01:10:04.658 --> 01:10:06.618
- I am so sorry!
- No. you're okay.

1164
01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.412
I'm... No. of course. you are.
I'm so sorry.

1165
01:10:08.495 --> 01:10:10.289
You're perfect. I like you.
it's just...

1166
01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.623
- I'm so sorry.
- V. I swear. you didn't do anything wrong.

1167
01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:13.125
I am so sorry. okay?

1168
01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.877
No. don't be sorry. it's...
It's not like that.

1169
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.170
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

1170
01:10:19.756 --> 01:10:20.841
[sobbing]

1171
01:10:48.952 --> 01:10:50.454
I can't sleep.

1172
01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:05.052
You know. I can always see
where you are on Find A Friend

1173
01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:07.054
when your phone isn't dead.

1174
01:11:07.137 --> 01:11:09.473
You better delete me
off of that.

1175
01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:10.849
Like tomorrow.

1176
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.768
so I don't tell Mom
about your Finsta.

1177
01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:14.061
Fine!

1178
01:11:15.854 --> 01:11:17.439
Why do you care where I am?

1179
01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:18.690
I don't.

1180
01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:24.488
You're always at a house
in North Bay.

1181
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:25.656
Why?

1182
01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:27.908
It's where my friend Mia lives.

1183
01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:29.159
Hmm.

1184
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:40.963
V. I'm scared.

1185
01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:42.589
Of what?

1186
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.928
What if...

1187
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:56.728
What if a shooter comes
to my school next?

1188
01:11:58.355 --> 01:12:00.148
It won't happen.

1189
01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:01.733
How do you know?

1190
01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:14.037
Sorry. I almost got you
killed in a shooting.

1191
01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.212
What're you talking about?

1192
01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:24.631
If I hadn't texted you
about my stupid period.

1193
01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.925
you wouldn't have
left the classroom.

1194
01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.553
You would've been safe.

1195
01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:32.055
- You could've died.
- That's not true.

1196
01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:33.473
Yes. it is!

1197
01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:34.725
Quinton's brother died.
'cause he was walking

1198
01:12:34.808 --> 01:12:36.476
in the same hallway.

1199
01:12:40.063 --> 01:12:42.524
It wasn't safe anywhere

1200
01:12:42.607 --> 01:12:44.359
Definitely wasn't your fault.

1201
01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:48.780
Then why have you been
so mad at me?

1202
01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:51.450
I haven't been mad at you.

1203
01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:53.118
Why do you keep thinking that?

1204
01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:55.037
