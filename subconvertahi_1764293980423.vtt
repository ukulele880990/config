00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.929
-Hey. look who�s here.
-Maestro!

2
00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.330
You couldn�t play something good. huh?
Like Hank Williams?

3
00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.429
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

4
00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.830
-Was it worth two weeks?
-Easiest time I ever did.

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.229
-No such thing as easy time in the hole.
-A week in the hole is like a year.

6
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.729
-Damn straight.
-I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

7
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.929
So they let you tote
that record player down there. huh?

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.729
It was in here.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.729
ln here.

10
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.030
That�s the beauty of music. They...

11
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.530
...can�t get that from you.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.429
Haven�t you ever feIt
that way about music?

13
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.330
Well. I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

14
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.129
Lost interest in it. though.

15
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.929
Didn�t make much sense in here.

16
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.229
Here�s where it makes the most sense.

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.830
You need it so you don�t forget.

18
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:00.629
Forget?

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.129
Forget that there are...

20
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.729
...places...

21
00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.030
...in the world
that aren�t made out of stone.

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.530
There�s something...

23
00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.330
...inside...

24
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.530
...that they can�t get to...

25
00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.129
...that they can�t touch.

26
00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:20.129
That�s yours.

27
00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:23.229
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.529
Hope.

29
00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:27.928
Hope.

30
00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.829
Let me tell you something. my friend.

31
00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:34.928
Hope is a dangerous thing.

32
00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.428
Hope can drive a man insane.

33
00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:41.329
It�s got no use on the inside.

34
00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:43.728
You�d better get used to that idea.

35
00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:47.728
Like Brooks did?

37
00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.029
Sit down.

38
00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:22.728
Says here that you�ve served
30 years of a life sentence.

39
00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:25.928
You feel you�ve been rehabilitated?

40
00:02:26.128 --> 00:02:27.329
Oh. yes. sir.

41
00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:30.029
Without a doubt.

42
00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:33.529
I can honestly say I�m a changed man.

43
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.529
No danger to society here.

44
00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.529
God�s honest truth.

45
00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.228
Absolutely rehabilitated.

46
00:02:54.228 --> 00:02:55.529
Thirty years.

47
00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.428
Jesus. when you say it like that....

48
00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.128
You wonder where it went.

49
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.728
I wonder where 10 years went.

50
00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:12.728
Here.

51
00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:15.829
A little parole rejection present.

52
00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:18.829
Go ahead and open it.

53
00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:21.928
Went through one of your competitors.

54
00:03:22.228 --> 00:03:25.329
I hope you don�t mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

55
00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.829
It�s very pretty.

56
00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:39.728
Thank you.

57
00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.829
You going to play it?

58
00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.628
No.

59
00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:54.628
Not right now.

60
00:04:12.328 --> 00:04:13.427
Roll in!

61
00:04:49.627 --> 00:04:50.828
Lights out!

62
00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:27.627
Andy was as good as his word.

63
00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.727
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

64
00:05:32.828 --> 00:05:36.927
In 1959. the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

65
00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:40.328
...they couldn�t buy him off
withjust a $200 check.

66
00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:44.828
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

67
00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:46.927
...just to shut him up.

68
00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:50.127
And you�d be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

69
00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:53.227
He made deals with book clubs.
charity groups.

70
00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:56.227
He bought remaindered books
by the pound....

71
00:05:56.727 --> 00:05:58.227
Treasure Island.

72
00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:00.127
Robert Louis--

73
00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:01.328
Stevenson.

74
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.927
Fiction. adventure.

75
00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:06.528
What�s next?

76
00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:09.727
I got here Auto Repair...

77
00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:11.727
...and Soap Carving.

78
00:06:11.927 --> 00:06:15.127
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under ''Educational.'' behind you.

79
00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:17.227
Count of Monte Crisco.

80
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.927
That�s ''Cristo.'' you dumb shit.

81
00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:22.028
By Alexandree...

82
00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:23.828
...Dum-ass.

83
00:06:24.127 --> 00:06:25.127
Dumb ass.

84
00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:28.528
Dumb ass?

85
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:33.427
Dumas. Know what that�s about?

86
00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:37.627
You�d like it.
it�s about a prison break.

87
00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:41.727
We ought to file that
under ''Educational'' too. oughtn�t we?

88
00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:46.727
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

89
00:06:47.328 --> 00:06:49.028
By the year Kennedy was shot...

90
00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:53.828
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

91
00:06:54.127 --> 00:06:57.227
...into the best prison library
in New England...

92
00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:00.827
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

93
00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:10.126
That was also when Warden Norton...

94
00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:13.327
...instituted his famous
''Inside Out'' program.

95
00:07:13.726 --> 00:07:15.827
You may remember reading about it.

96
00:07:16.027 --> 00:07:19.126
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

97
00:07:19.327 --> 00:07:20.626
It�s no free ride...

98
00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:24.126
..but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

99
00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:26.827
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

100
00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:29.626
Our inmates. properly supervised...

101
00:07:29.827 --> 00:07:32.527
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

102
00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:36.226
...performing all manner
of public service.

103
00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:38.726
These men can learn the value...

104
00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:42.726
...of an honest day�s labor and
provide a service to the community...

105
00:07:43.027 --> 00:07:47.726
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

106
00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:50.426
Of course he didn�t tell the press...

107
00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:54.126
...that ''bare minimum of expense''
is a fairly loose term.

108
00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:57.327
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

109
00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:00.027
Men. materials. you name it.

110
00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:03.327
And oh. my Lord.
how the money rolled in!

111
00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:06.027
At this rate.
you�ll put me out of business.

112
00:08:06.226 --> 00:08:10.626
With this pool of slave labor.
you can underbid any contractor in town.

113
00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:14.226
We�re providing
a valuable community service.

114
00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:18.027
That�s fine for the papers.
but I�ve got a family to feed.

115
00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:22.226
We go back a long way.

116
00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:28.527
I need this highway contract. I don�t
get it and I go under. That�s a fact.

117
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.226
You have some of this fine pie...

118
00:08:31.426 --> 00:08:34.827
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

119
00:08:43.027 --> 00:08:45.726
I wouldn�t worry too much
about this contract.

120
00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:49.027
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

121
00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:54.126
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

122
00:08:55.226 --> 00:08:57.426
And behind every shady deal...

123
00:08:57.726 --> 00:09:00.327
...behind every dollar earned...

124
00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:03.726
...there was Andy. keeping the books.

125
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.327
Two deposits.

126
00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:09.726
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always. sir.

127
00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:44.226
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

128
00:09:44.725 --> 00:09:48.225
If they over-starch my shirts again.
they�ll hear from me.

129
00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:49.826
How do I look?

130
00:09:50.826 --> 00:09:53.326
-Very nice.
-Big charity to-do up Portland way.

131
00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.026
Governor will be there.

132
00:09:56.526 --> 00:09:57.925
You want the rest of this?

133
00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:01.225
Woman can�t bake worth shit.

134
00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:03.826
Thank you. sir.

135
00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:09.826
He�s got his fingers
in a lot of pies. from what I hear.

136
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:14.925
He�s got scams you haven�t even
dreamed of.Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

137
00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:17.425
A river of dirty money
running through here.

138
00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:21.526
Sooner or later. he�ll have to
explain where it came from.

139
00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:23.425
That�s where I come in.

140
00:10:24.026 --> 00:10:26.326
I channel it. FiIter it. Funnel it.

141
00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:29.425
Stocks. securities.
tax-free municipals.

142
00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:33.225
I send it out into the real world.
and when it comes back....

143
00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:36.425
-Clean as a virgin�s honeypot. huh?
-Cleaner.

144
00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:40.625
By the time Norton retires.
l�ll have made him a millionaire.

145
00:10:43.026 --> 00:10:47.326
If they ever catch on. he�ll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

146
00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:50.326
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

147
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:53.526
I know you�re good.
but all that paper leaves a trail.

148
00:10:53.725 --> 00:10:57.125
Now anybody gets curious.
FBl. IRS...

149
00:10:57.326 --> 00:10:58.326
...whatever.

150
00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.026
It�ll lead to somebody.

151
00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:04.125
Sure it is. but not to me.
and certainly not to the warden.

152
00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:09.526
All right. who?

153
00:11:09.725 --> 00:11:11.326
Randall Stevens.

154
00:11:11.826 --> 00:11:12.826
Who?

155
00:11:13.026 --> 00:11:15.026
The ''silent'' silent partner.

156
00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:18.225
He�s the guiIty one.
the man with the bank accounts.

157
00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:20.625
It�s where the fiItering
process starts.

158
00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:23.725
They trace anything.
it�ll just lead to him.

159
00:11:24.326 --> 00:11:25.526
But who is he?

160
00:11:25.725 --> 00:11:29.725
He�s a phantom. an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

161
00:11:30.826 --> 00:11:31.925
I conjured him...

162
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.526
...out of thin air.

163
00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:37.026
He doesn�t exist. except on paper.

164
00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:42.526
You can�t just make a person up.

165
00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:45.826
Sure you can.
if you know how the system works.

166
00:11:46.326 --> 00:11:49.125
It�s amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

167
00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:52.125
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

168
00:11:52.326 --> 00:11:54.425
...driver�s license. Social Security.

169
00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:55.725
You�re shitting me.

170
00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:59.326
If they trace any accounts.
they�ll wind up chasing...

171
00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:01.225
...a figment of my imagination.

172
00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:03.425
Well. I�ll be damned!

173
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.526
Did I say you were good?

174
00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.526
Shit. you are Rembrandt.

175
00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:10.925
The funny thing is...

176
00:12:11.225 --> 00:12:15.225
...on the outside. I was an honest man.
straight as an arrow.

177
00:12:15.725 --> 00:12:18.026
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

178
00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:28.225
Ever bother you?

179
00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:32.724
I don�t run the scams.
I just process the profits.

180
00:12:32.924 --> 00:12:34.924
A fine line. maybe...

181
00:12:35.525 --> 00:12:37.624
...but I also buiIt that library...

182
00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.825
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

183
00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:43.224
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

184
00:12:43.525 --> 00:12:45.624
lKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

185
00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:47.325
Money instead of sheets.

186
00:12:47.724 --> 00:12:50.325
Well. I work cheap.
That�s the tradeoff.

187
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:10.224
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

188
00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.624
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

189
00:13:12.924 --> 00:13:15.224
That�s breaking and entering to you.

190
00:13:15.525 --> 00:13:19.724
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

191
00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:21.525
Young punk.

192
00:13:21.724 --> 00:13:23.325
Mr. Rock �n� Roll...

193
00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:25.025
...cocky as hell.

194
00:13:25.224 --> 00:13:27.624
Come on. old boys.
Moving like molasses!

195
00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:29.624
Making me look bad.

196
00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:31.624
We liked him immediately.

197
00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:35.624
I�m backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

198
00:13:35.924 --> 00:13:39.525
A big old thing. I couldn�t see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

199
00:13:40.224 --> 00:13:42.124
''Freeze. kid. hands in the air.''

200
00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:46.825
I was standing there. holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

201
00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:50.825
''You hear what I said. boy?''
I say. ''Yes. sir. I did.

202
00:13:51.025 --> 00:13:54.525
But if I drop this. you get me
on destruction of property too.''

203
00:13:59.025 --> 00:14:01.325
You done some stretch
in Cashman. right?

204
00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:05.724
Yeah. that was an easy piece of time.
let me tell you.

205
00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:07.924
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

206
00:14:08.124 --> 00:14:09.224
Not like here.

207
00:14:09.424 --> 00:14:11.825
Sounds like you done time all over.

208
00:14:12.325 --> 00:14:14.724
l�ve been in and out since I was 1 3.

209
00:14:14.924 --> 00:14:17.124
Name it. chances are I�ve been there.

210
00:14:17.325 --> 00:14:19.924
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

211
00:14:21.424 --> 00:14:22.924
What I mean is...

212
00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:26.724
...you�re not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

213
00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:30.224
Yeah. what the hell
you know about it. Capone?

214
00:14:30.624 --> 00:14:32.224
What are you in for?

215
00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:33.525
Me?

216
00:14:35.924 --> 00:14:37.624
A lawyer fucked me.

217
00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:44.424
Everybody�s innocent in here.
Don�t you know that?

218
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:56.825
As it turned out. Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

219
00:14:57.325 --> 00:14:59.424
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

220
00:14:59.724 --> 00:15:02.124
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

221
00:15:02.525 --> 00:15:03.825
Whatever it was...

222
00:15:04.224 --> 00:15:06.624
...something lit a fire
under that boy�s ass.

223
00:15:10.424 --> 00:15:13.325
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

224
00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:16.025
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

225
00:15:17.424 --> 00:15:19.623
I don�t waste time with losers. Tommy.

226
00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:23.524
I ain�t no goddamn loser.

227
00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:27.123
-You mean that?
-Yeah.

228
00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:30.223
You really mean that?

229
00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:32.623
Yes. sir. I do.

230
00:15:32.824 --> 00:15:34.824
Good. Because if we do this...

231
00:15:35.024 --> 00:15:38.923
...we do it all the way.
a hundred percent. nothing half-assed.

232
00:15:39.223 --> 00:15:41.024
Thing is. see...

233
00:15:42.223 --> 00:15:43.824
...I don�t read so good.

234
00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:46.024
''Well.''

235
00:15:48.024 --> 00:15:49.824
You don�t read...

236
00:15:50.024 --> 00:15:51.524
...so well.

237
00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:55.423
We�ll get to that.

238
00:15:59.824 --> 00:16:01.923
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

239
00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:04.824
Started walking him through his ABC�s.

240
00:16:06.923 --> 00:16:09.123
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

241
00:16:09.423 --> 00:16:12.223
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

242
00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:17.923
Before long. Andy started him
on his course requirements.

243
00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:19.824
He really liked the kid.

244
00:16:20.024 --> 00:16:23.623
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

245
00:16:24.123 --> 00:16:26.324
But that wasn�t the only reason.

246
00:16:27.024 --> 00:16:29.223
Prison time is slow time.

247
00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:32.324
So you do what you can to keep going.

248
00:16:32.623 --> 00:16:34.723
Some fellas collect stamps.

249
00:16:35.123 --> 00:16:37.623
Others build matchstick houses.

250
00:16:38.223 --> 00:16:40.824
Andy buiIt a library.

251
00:16:41.423 --> 00:16:43.324
Now he needed a new project.

252
00:16:44.223 --> 00:16:45.623
Tommy was it.

253
00:16:46.324 --> 00:16:50.324
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

254
00:16:50.824 --> 00:16:54.123
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

255
00:16:55.024 --> 00:16:56.223
In prison...

256
00:16:56.524 --> 00:17:00.223
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

257
00:17:01.024 --> 00:17:05.923
By 1966. right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

258
00:17:06.123 --> 00:17:08.324
...it was lovely Raquel.

259
00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:25.923
Time.

260
00:17:31.923 --> 00:17:32.923
Well?

261
00:17:34.524 --> 00:17:36.623
Well. it�s for shit.

262
00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:40.024
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

263
00:17:40.223 --> 00:17:41.723
It�s probably not that bad.

264
00:17:41.923 --> 00:17:46.123
I didn�t get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

265
00:17:46.324 --> 00:17:48.123
Let�s see how the score comes out.

266
00:17:48.324 --> 00:17:51.223
l�ll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

267
00:17:53.223 --> 00:17:54.524
Two points. right there!

268
00:17:54.723 --> 00:17:56.324
There�s your goddamn score!

269
00:17:56.524 --> 00:18:00.223
Goddamn cats crawling up trees.
5 times 5 is 25....

270
00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:02.824
Fuck this place!

271
00:18:03.024 --> 00:18:04.223
Fuck it!

272
00:18:23.323 --> 00:18:24.622
I feel bad.

273
00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:26.023
I let him down.

274
00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:27.922
That�s crap. kid.

275
00:18:28.122 --> 00:18:29.523
He�s proud of you.

276
00:18:29.823 --> 00:18:32.722
We�re old friends.
I know him as good as anybody.

277
00:18:32.922 --> 00:18:34.422
Smart fellow. ain�t he?

278
00:18:34.622 --> 00:18:37.823
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

279
00:18:38.023 --> 00:18:40.222
What�s he in here for anyway?

280
00:18:40.523 --> 00:18:41.523
Murder.

281
00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:44.323
The hell. you say.

282
00:18:46.523 --> 00:18:48.823
You wouldn�t think it
to look at the guy.

283
00:18:50.122 --> 00:18:54.122
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

284
00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:03.222
What?

285
00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:07.122
About four years ago...

286
00:19:07.323 --> 00:19:10.622
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

287
00:19:11.122 --> 00:19:12.422
I stole a car.

288
00:19:12.722 --> 00:19:14.722
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

289
00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:17.622
About six months left to go...

290
00:19:17.922 --> 00:19:19.823
...I get a new cellmate in.

291
00:19:20.523 --> 00:19:22.222
Elmo Blatch.

292
00:19:22.922 --> 00:19:24.222
Big. twitchy fucker.

293
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:28.622
lKind of roomie you pray you don�t get.
You know what I�m saying?

294
00:19:28.823 --> 00:19:31.523
Six-to-twelve. armed burglary.

295
00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:34.122
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

296
00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:39.222
Hard to believe. high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart. he jumped three feet.

297
00:19:40.323 --> 00:19:44.922
Talked all the time too. That�s
the other thing. He never shut up.

298
00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:46.722
Places he�d been in...

299
00:19:47.023 --> 00:19:50.122
...jobs he�d pulled. women he fucked.

300
00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.523
Even people he killed.

301
00:19:53.823 --> 00:19:56.622
People who ''gave him shit.''

302
00:19:57.222 --> 00:19:58.823
That�s how he put it.

303
00:20:01.422 --> 00:20:03.422
So one night. like a joke...

304
00:20:04.622 --> 00:20:08.122
...I say to him.
''Elmo. who did you kill?''

305
00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:09.422
So he says:

306
00:20:09.622 --> 00:20:13.622
I got me this job one time.
busing tables at a country club...

307
00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:18.122
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

308
00:20:20.222 --> 00:20:22.222
So I pick out this guy...

309
00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:24.722
...go in one night...

310
00:20:24.922 --> 00:20:26.622
...and do his place.

311
00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:29.422
He wakes up...

312
00:20:30.222 --> 00:20:31.922
...and gives me shit.

313
00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.622
So I killed him.

314
00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:39.323
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

315
00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:42.922
And that�s the best part.

316
00:20:43.622 --> 00:20:46.122
She�s fucking this prick. see...

317
00:20:46.323 --> 00:20:49.323
...this golf pro.
but she�s married to some other guy.

318
00:20:49.922 --> 00:20:52.522
Some hotshot banker.

319
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.421
And he�s the one they pinned it on.

320
00:21:07.921 --> 00:21:11.822
I have to say that�s
the most amazing story I ever heard.

321
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:15.621
What amazes me most
is you�d be taken in by it.

322
00:21:16.322 --> 00:21:17.322
Sir?

323
00:21:19.522 --> 00:21:23.121
It�s obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

324
00:21:23.721 --> 00:21:27.621
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

325
00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:30.022
He�s young. not terribly bright.

326
00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:34.022
It�s not surprising he wouldn�t
know what a state he put you in.

327
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:35.921
Sir. he�s telling the truth.

328
00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:40.921
Let�s say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

329
00:21:41.221 --> 00:21:45.822
You think he�d just fall to his knees
and cry. ''Yes. I did it. I confess.

330
00:21:46.022 --> 00:21:48.721
By the way.
add a life term to my sentence.''

331
00:21:48.921 --> 00:21:51.721
With Tommy�s testimony.
I can get a new trial.

332
00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:54.421
That�s assuming Blatch is still there.

333
00:21:54.621 --> 00:21:56.522
Chances are. he�d be released by now.

334
00:21:56.721 --> 00:21:59.221
They�d have his last known address.

335
00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:01.322
It�s a chance. isn�t it?

336
00:22:03.721 --> 00:22:05.421
How can you be so obtuse?

337
00:22:06.322 --> 00:22:07.322
What?

338
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:10.322
What did you call me?

339
00:22:10.522 --> 00:22:12.221
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

340
00:22:12.621 --> 00:22:14.121
You�re forgetting yourself.

341
00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:17.421
The country club
will have his old timecards.

342
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:20.421
Records. W-2s with his name on them.

343
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:23.322
If you want to indulge this fantasy.
it�s your business.

344
00:22:23.522 --> 00:22:26.121
Don�t make it mine.
This meeting is over.

345
00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:28.921
If I got out. I�d never mention
what happens here.

346
00:22:29.522 --> 00:22:32.522
I�d be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

347
00:22:34.322 --> 00:22:37.322
Don�t ever mention money to me.
you son of a bitch!

348
00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:39.121
Not in this office...

349
00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:41.322
...not anywhere.
Get in here. now!

350
00:22:41.522 --> 00:22:44.221
I just wanted to put you at ease.
that�s all.

351
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:46.121
Solitary. A month.

352
00:22:47.121 --> 00:22:48.421
What�s wrong with you?

353
00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:49.921
Get him out of here.

354
00:22:50.121 --> 00:22:51.721
This is my chance to get out!

355
00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:53.721
It�s my life! Understand?!

356
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:56.022
Get him out!

357
00:22:57.721 --> 00:22:59.721
A month in the hole.

358
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:02.621
That�s the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

359
00:23:02.822 --> 00:23:04.121
It�s all my fauIt.

360
00:23:04.322 --> 00:23:05.921
Bullshit.

361
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:09.322
You didn�t pull the trigger
or convict him.

362
00:23:09.522 --> 00:23:11.921
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

363
00:23:12.121 --> 00:23:14.121
I mean. for real innocent?

364
00:23:14.322 --> 00:23:15.621
It looks that way.

365
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.022
Sweet Jesus.

366
00:23:18.322 --> 00:23:20.121
How long has he been here now?

367
00:23:20.522 --> 00:23:23.822
1 947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

368
00:23:24.022 --> 00:23:26.621
-Williams. Thomas.
-Yeah. over here.

369
00:23:32.421 --> 00:23:33.621
What you got?

370
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:35.621
Board of Education.

371
00:23:35.822 --> 00:23:37.322
That son of a bitch mailed it.

372
00:23:37.521 --> 00:23:41.521
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

373
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.821
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

374
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:47.220
Skeets. come on.
Give me that. you shithead.

375
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:49.321
Floyd. come on.

376
00:23:54.821 --> 00:23:57.220
Will you throw that away. please?

377
00:24:02.821 --> 00:24:04.521
Well. shit.

378
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.021
The kid passed. C + average.

379
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.321
Thought you�d like to know.

380
00:24:38.521 --> 00:24:40.021
Warden wants to talk.

381
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.821
Out here?

382
00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:57.220
That�s what the man said.

383
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.420
Warden?

384
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.420
I�m asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

385
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:32.220
I feel awkward enough as it is.

386
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720
We got a situation here.

387
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.720
I think you can appreciate that.

388
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.120
Yes. sir.

389
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.821
I sure can.

390
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.120
I tell you. son. this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

391
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.120
It�s got me up nights.
That�s the truth.

392
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.321
The right thing to do...

393
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.720
...sometimes it�s hard to know
what that is.

394
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.120
Do you understand?

395
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.021
I need your help. son.

396
00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:26.619
If I�m going to move on this...

397
00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:30.119
...there can�t be
the least little shred of doubt.

398
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.919
I have to know...

399
00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:34.719
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

400
00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:36.119
Yes. sir.

401
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.520
Absolutely.

402
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.020
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

403
00:26:41.219 --> 00:26:43.219
...with your hand on the Good Book...

404
00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:46.119
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

405
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.119
Just give me that chance.

406
00:26:52.419 --> 00:26:53.719
That�s what I thought.

407
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.719
I�m sure by now you�ve heard.

408
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520
Terrible thing.

409
00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:48.619
A man that young...

410
00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:51.520
...less than a year to go.
trying to escape.

411
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.520
Broke Captain Hadley�s heart
to shoot him.

412
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.820
Truly. it did.

413
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.219
We just have to put it behind us.

414
00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:05.119
Move on.

415
00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:08.219
I�m done.

416
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.119
Everything stops.

417
00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:15.419
Get someone else to run your scams.

418
00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:18.520
Nothing stops.

419
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.020
Nothing.

420
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.619
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

421
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.320
No more protection from the guards.

422
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.419
l�ll pull you out of that 1 -bunk HiIton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

423
00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.219
You�ll think you�ve been
fucked by a train.

424
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:42.119
And the library?

425
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.820
Gone.

426
00:28:44.419 --> 00:28:47.020
Sealed off. brick by brick.

427
00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:50.119
We�ll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

428
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.419
They�ll see the flames for miles.

429
00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:55.520
We�ll dance around it like wild Injuns.

430
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.719
You understand me? Catching my drift?

431
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.419
Or am I being obtuse?

432
00:29:17.118 --> 00:29:19.819
Give him another month
to think about it.

433
00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:09.618
My wife used to say
I�m a hard man to know.

434
00:30:10.418 --> 00:30:12.218
Like a closed book.

435
00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.118
Complained about it all the time.

436
00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:17.618
She was beautiful.

437
00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:21.519
God. I loved her.

438
00:30:25.218 --> 00:30:27.418
I didn�t know how
to show it. that�s all.

439
00:30:30.218 --> 00:30:31.819
I killed her. Red.

440
00:30:33.718 --> 00:30:35.519
I didn�t pull the trigger...

441
00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:38.718
...but I drove her away.

442
00:30:40.218 --> 00:30:42.918
That�s why she died. because of me...

443
00:30:43.118 --> 00:30:44.519
...the way I am.

444
00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.319
That don�t make you a murderer.

445
00:30:58.718 --> 00:31:00.418
Bad husband. maybe.

446
00:31:04.118 --> 00:31:07.418
Feel bad about it if you want.
but you didn�t pull the trigger.

447
00:31:07.618 --> 00:31:08.918
No. I didn�t.

448
00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:11.218
Somebody else did.

449
00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:14.618
And I wound up in here.

450
00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:18.618
Bad luck. I guess.

451
00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:25.319
It floats around.

452
00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:28.519
It�s got to land on somebody.

453
00:31:29.418 --> 00:31:31.319
It was my turn. that�s all.

454
00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:34.819
I was in the path of the tornado.

455
00:31:40.819 --> 00:31:44.718
I just didn�t expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

456
00:31:49.118 --> 00:31:50.819
Think you�ll ever get out of here?

457
00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:53.019
Me?

458
00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:57.019
Yeah.

459
00:31:58.318 --> 00:32:00.617
One day. when I got
a long. white beard...

460
00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:04.018
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

461
00:32:06.018 --> 00:32:07.717
I tell you where I�d go.

462
00:32:09.217 --> 00:32:10.818
Zihuatanejo.

463
00:32:11.717 --> 00:32:12.917
Say what?

464
00:32:13.217 --> 00:32:15.018
Zihuatanejo.

465
00:32:16.018 --> 00:32:17.617
It�s in Mexico.

466
00:32:19.018 --> 00:32:21.117
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

467
00:32:22.318 --> 00:32:25.117
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

468
00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:28.917
They say it has no memory.

469
00:32:30.818 --> 00:32:33.518
That�s where I want to live
the rest of my life.

470
00:32:35.117 --> 00:32:37.617
A warm place with no memory.

471
00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:42.818
Open up a little hotel...

472
00:32:44.518 --> 00:32:46.018
...right on the beach.

473
00:32:46.617 --> 00:32:48.818
Buy some worthless old boat...

474
00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:51.018
...and fix it up new.

475
00:32:53.717 --> 00:32:55.018
Take my guests out...

476
00:32:55.818 --> 00:32:57.217
...charter fishing.

477
00:33:01.018 --> 00:33:02.717
Zihuatanejo.

478
00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:10.117
ln a place like that. I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

479
00:33:16.717 --> 00:33:19.518
I don�t think I could make it
on the outside.

480
00:33:26.217 --> 00:33:28.318
I been in here most of my life.

481
00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:31.518
I�m an institutional man now.

482
00:33:32.417 --> 00:33:34.117
Just like Brooks was.

483
00:33:35.617 --> 00:33:37.318
You underestimate yourself.

484
00:33:37.818 --> 00:33:39.417
I don�t think so.

485
00:33:43.318 --> 00:33:47.217
ln here I�m the guy who can get things
for you. sure. but...

486
00:33:48.018 --> 00:33:50.518
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

487
00:33:50.717 --> 00:33:52.917
Hell. I wouldn�t know
where to begin.

488
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:56.717
Pacific Ocean?

489
00:33:57.117 --> 00:33:58.417
Shit.

490
00:33:58.717 --> 00:34:00.917
Scare me to death.
something that big.

491
00:34:01.117 --> 00:34:02.417
Not me.

492
00:34:03.617 --> 00:34:06.417
I didn�t shoot my wife.
and I didn�t shoot her lover.

493
00:34:08.117 --> 00:34:11.417
Whatever mistakes I made.
l�ve paid for them and then some.

494
00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.917
That hotel. that boat....

495
00:34:15.717 --> 00:34:17.917
I don�t think that�s too much to ask.

496
00:34:22.818 --> 00:34:25.318
You shouldn�t be doing this to yourself.

497
00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:27.518
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

498
00:34:27.917 --> 00:34:30.417
Mexico is way down there
and you�re in here...

499
00:34:30.617 --> 00:34:32.117
...and that�s the way it is.

500
00:34:32.518 --> 00:34:35.318
Yeah. right.
That�s the way it is.

501
00:34:36.818 --> 00:34:39.217
It�s down there and I�m in here.

502
00:34:41.818 --> 00:34:44.517
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

503
00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:48.916
Get busy living...

504
00:34:50.317 --> 00:34:52.317
...or get busy dying.

505
00:35:04.517 --> 00:35:07.216
If you ever get out of here.
do me a favor.

506
00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:09.716
Sure. Andy. Anything.

507
00:35:11.517 --> 00:35:15.416
There�s a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

508
00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:20.017
-A lot of hayfields up there.
-One in particular.

509
00:35:20.216 --> 00:35:24.116
It�s got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

510
00:35:24.317 --> 00:35:27.216
It�s like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

511
00:35:28.116 --> 00:35:30.616
It�s where I asked my wife to marry me.

512
00:35:32.116 --> 00:35:34.116
We went there for a picnic...

513
00:35:34.616 --> 00:35:36.616
...and made love under that oak...

514
00:35:37.317 --> 00:35:39.616
...and I asked and she said yes.

515
00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:45.416
Promise me. Red.

516
00:35:46.216 --> 00:35:47.916
If you ever get out...

517
00:35:48.116 --> 00:35:49.616
...find that spot.

518
00:35:50.716 --> 00:35:55.616
At the base of that wall. there�s a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

519
00:35:56.716 --> 00:35:59.716
Piece of black. volcanic glass.

520
00:36:02.416 --> 00:36:05.116
Something�s buried under it
I want you to have.

521
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:07.116
What. Andy?

522
00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:09.317
What�s buried under there?

523
00:36:10.916 --> 00:36:12.716
You�ll have to pry it up...

524
00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:14.216
...to see.

525
00:36:20.116 --> 00:36:22.017
No. I�m telling you. The guy is....

526
00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:24.416
He�s talking funny.

527
00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.216
I�m really worried about him.

528
00:36:27.616 --> 00:36:29.116
Let�s keep an eye on him.

529
00:36:29.317 --> 00:36:32.517
That�s fine during the day.
but at night he�s all alone.

530
00:36:34.017 --> 00:36:35.116
Oh. Lord.

531
00:36:36.517 --> 00:36:37.317
What?

532
00:36:38.817 --> 00:36:41.616
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

533
00:36:41.817 --> 00:36:43.817
He asked me for a length of rope.

534
00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:44.916
Rope?

535
00:36:45.116 --> 00:36:46.817
Six feet long.

536
00:36:47.017 --> 00:36:48.416
And you gave it to him.

537
00:36:49.216 --> 00:36:51.017
Sure. Why wouldn�t I?

538
00:36:51.216 --> 00:36:52.817
Jesus! Heywood.

539
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:55.416
How was I supposed to know?

540
00:36:55.616 --> 00:36:57.116
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

541
00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:01.116
Andy would never do that.

542
00:37:01.716 --> 00:37:02.716
Never.

543
00:37:04.817 --> 00:37:06.116
I don�t know.

544
00:37:09.017 --> 00:37:11.017
Every man has his breaking point.

545
00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:15.616
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

546
00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:17.716
Just about finished. sir.

547
00:37:34.816 --> 00:37:36.415
Three deposits tonight.

548
00:37:44.415 --> 00:37:46.316
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

549
00:37:46.516 --> 00:37:48.115
And shine my shoes.

550
00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:51.316
-I want them looking like mirrors.
-Yes. sir.

551
00:37:56.816 --> 00:37:58.316
It�s good having you back.

552
00:37:59.215 --> 00:38:01.115
Place wasn�t the same without you.

553
00:38:47.915 --> 00:38:49.016
Lights out!

554
00:39:21.816 --> 00:39:24.415
I�ve had some long nights in stir.

555
00:39:24.915 --> 00:39:27.615
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

556
00:39:27.816 --> 00:39:30.516
...time can draw out like a blade.

557
00:39:35.816 --> 00:39:38.816
That was the longest night of my life.

558
00:39:54.615 --> 00:39:55.816
Give me a count!

559
00:40:00.316 --> 00:40:03.215
Tier 3 south. clear!

560
00:40:06.316 --> 00:40:09.516
Man missing on tier 2. cell 245!

561
00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:10.715
Dufresne!

562
00:40:11.316 --> 00:40:13.715
Come out. You�re holding up the show!

563
00:40:16.816 --> 00:40:20.214
Don�t make me come down
or I�ll thump your skull for you!

564
00:40:27.815 --> 00:40:31.614
Damn it. you�re putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

565
00:40:31.914 --> 00:40:35.214
You�d better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

566
00:40:35.414 --> 00:40:36.714
You hear me?

567
00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:44.914
Oh. my Holy God.

568
00:41:01.914 --> 00:41:04.414
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

569
00:41:04.914 --> 00:41:07.414
-Start with that friend of his.
-Who?

570
00:41:10.015 --> 00:41:11.614
Open 237.

571
00:41:15.114 --> 00:41:18.815
What do you mean. ''He just wasn�t here''?
Don�t say that to me.

572
00:41:19.614 --> 00:41:21.015
Don�t tell me that again.

573
00:41:21.214 --> 00:41:22.214
But sir. he wasn�t.

574
00:41:22.414 --> 00:41:25.914
I can see that. Haig!
Think I�m blind?

575
00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:28.015
ls that what you�re saying?

576
00:41:28.214 --> 00:41:30.815
-Am I blind. Haig?
-No. sir!

577
00:41:31.714 --> 00:41:34.214
What about you. You blind?

578
00:41:34.714 --> 00:41:37.315
-Tell me what this is.
-Last night�s count.

579
00:41:37.515 --> 00:41:40.815
You see Dufresne�s name there?
I sure do. Right there.

580
00:41:41.015 --> 00:41:42.414
''Dufresne.''

581
00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:45.515
He was in his cell...

582
00:41:45.714 --> 00:41:46.714
...at lights out.

583
00:41:46.914 --> 00:41:49.214
Reasonable he�d be here in the morning.

584
00:41:50.214 --> 00:41:51.815
I want him found.

585
00:41:52.015 --> 00:41:55.515
Not tomorrow. not after breakfast. Now!

586
00:41:55.714 --> 00:41:56.914
Yes. sir.

587
00:41:57.914 --> 00:42:00.214
Let�s go. Move your butts.

588
00:42:03.614 --> 00:42:04.614
Stand.

589
00:42:06.015 --> 00:42:07.114
Well?

590
00:42:10.614 --> 00:42:11.515
Well. what?

591
00:42:11.815 --> 00:42:15.214
I see you two all the time.
You�re thick as thieves. you are.

592
00:42:16.315 --> 00:42:17.815
He must have said something.

593
00:42:18.515 --> 00:42:20.015
No. sir. Warden.

594
00:42:20.414 --> 00:42:21.414
Not a word.

595
00:42:23.214 --> 00:42:25.815
Lord. it�s a miracle!

596
00:42:26.414 --> 00:42:29.015
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

597
00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:30.815
Nothing left...

598
00:42:31.614 --> 00:42:34.414
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

599
00:42:34.614 --> 00:42:37.315
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let�s ask her.

600
00:42:37.515 --> 00:42:39.315
Maybe she knows.

601
00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:42.214
What say there. fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

602
00:42:43.714 --> 00:42:45.015
Guess not.

603
00:42:45.614 --> 00:42:47.714
Why should she be any different?

604
00:42:48.815 --> 00:42:50.515
This is a conspiracy.

605
00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:53.015
That�s what this is.

606
00:42:53.614 --> 00:42:57.315
One big. damn conspiracy!

607
00:42:57.614 --> 00:42:59.614
And everyone�s in on it!

608
00:43:00.214 --> 00:43:01.414
lncluding her!

609
00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:38.113
In 1966...

610
00:43:38.314 --> 00:43:40.713
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

611
00:43:40.913 --> 00:43:42.514
...from Shawshank Prison.

612
00:43:44.713 --> 00:43:47.314
All they found
was a muddy set ofprison clothes...

613
00:43:47.913 --> 00:43:49.413
...a bar of soap...

614
00:43:49.613 --> 00:43:51.213
...and an old rock hammer...

615
00:43:51.413 --> 00:43:53.913
...damn near worn down to the nub.

616
00:43:58.413 --> 00:44:03.213
I had thought it�d take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

617
00:44:03.814 --> 00:44:06.413
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

618
00:44:24.713 --> 00:44:27.014
Oh. Andy loved geology.

619
00:44:27.814 --> 00:44:31.014
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

620
00:44:31.413 --> 00:44:33.213
An ice age here...

621
00:44:33.613 --> 00:44:36.113
...million years
of mountain building there.

622
00:44:37.113 --> 00:44:40.014
Geology is the study
ofpressure and time.

623
00:44:40.814 --> 00:44:42.814
That�s all it takes. really.

624
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:44.613
Pressure...

625
00:44:45.314 --> 00:44:46.514
...and time.

626
00:44:47.913 --> 00:44:49.913
That and a big goddamn poster.

627
00:44:54.014 --> 00:44:54.913
Like I said...

628
00:44:55.413 --> 00:44:59.413
...in prison. a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

629
00:45:02.213 --> 00:45:07.014
Seems Andy�s favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

630
00:45:07.613 --> 00:45:09.514
...a handful at a time.

631
00:45:10.814 --> 00:45:12.913
I guess after Tommy was killed...

632
00:45:13.113 --> 00:45:16.014
...Andy decided
he�d been here long enough.

633
00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:18.814
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

634
00:45:19.514 --> 00:45:21.613
I�m just about finished. sir.

635
00:45:43.014 --> 00:45:45.014
Three deposits tonight.

636
00:45:52.313 --> 00:45:54.612
Andy did like he was told.

637
00:45:54.813 --> 00:45:58.313
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

638
00:46:01.912 --> 00:46:04.212
The guards simply didn�t notice.

639
00:46:04.612 --> 00:46:06.013
Neither did I.

640
00:46:06.212 --> 00:46:07.712
I mean. seriously...

641
00:46:08.013 --> 00:46:10.912
...how often do you really look
at a man�s shoes?

642
00:48:14.513 --> 00:48:17.712
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

643
00:48:17.912 --> 00:48:21.313
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can�t even imagine.

644
00:48:22.313 --> 00:48:24.612
Or maybe Ijust don�t want to.

645
00:48:29.013 --> 00:48:31.412
Five hundred yards.

646
00:48:31.912 --> 00:48:34.912
That�s the length
of five football fields.

647
00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:38.111
Just shy of half a mile.

648
00:49:33.411 --> 00:49:38.012
The next morning. right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

649
00:49:38.312 --> 00:49:41.111
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

650
00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:43.911
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

651
00:49:44.512 --> 00:49:47.711
Until that moment.
he didn�t exist.

652
00:49:48.211 --> 00:49:50.611
-Except on paper.
-May I help you?

653
00:49:51.012 --> 00:49:52.911
He had all the proper ID...

654
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:56.812
...driver�s license. birth certificate.
Social Security card....

655
00:49:57.312 --> 00:49:59.812
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

656
00:50:00.012 --> 00:50:03.111
I must say I�m sorry
to be losing your business.

657
00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:05.111
I hope you�ll enjoy living abroad.

658
00:50:05.911 --> 00:50:07.012
Thank you.

659
00:50:07.611 --> 00:50:08.812
I�m sure I will.

660
00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:13.012
Here�s your cashier�s check. sir.
Will there be anything else?

661
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:14.211
Please.

662
00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:17.312
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

663
00:50:17.812 --> 00:50:19.012
I�d be happy to.

664
00:50:20.812 --> 00:50:22.111
Good day. sir.

665
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:27.512
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

666
00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:29.611
All told. he blew town...

667
00:50:29.812 --> 00:50:34.611
...with better than $370.000
of Warden Norton�s money.

668
00:50:35.312 --> 00:50:38.111
Severance pay for 19 years.

669
00:50:45.312 --> 00:50:47.512
Good morning. Portland Daily Bugle.

670
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:43.311
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

671
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:48.011
If you give up this right. anything you
say can be held against you in court.

672
00:51:48.511 --> 00:51:52.910
I wasn�t there to see. but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

673
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.610
...when they took him away.

674
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:03.910
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

675
00:52:19.811 --> 00:52:20.610
Samuel Norton.

676
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.811
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

677
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.710
Open the door.

678
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:31.511
I�m not sure which key.

679
00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.511
Make it easy on yourself. Norton!

680
00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.511
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

681
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:00.311
...other than that bullet...

682
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:05.011
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

683
00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:10.910
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

684
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.311
...I got a postcard in the mail.

685
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.610
It was blank.
but the postmark said...

686
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:19.910
...Fort Hancock. Texas.

687
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:21.811
Fort Hancock...

688
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.811
...right on the border.

689
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.210
That�s where Andy crossed.

690
00:53:26.811 --> 00:53:30.910
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

691
00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:33.511
...it always makes me laugh.

692
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:36.910
Andy Dufresne...

693
00:53:37.311 --> 00:53:39.311
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

694
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:41.910
...and came out clean
on the other side.

695
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:44.110
Andy Dufresne...

696
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.511
...headed for the Pacific.

697
00:53:49.511 --> 00:53:51.610
Hadley�s got him
by the throat. right?

698
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:55.710
He says. ''I believe this boy�s
about to have himself an accident.''

699
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.710
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

700
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:01.110
I swear. the stuff he pulled....

701
00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:04.311
''My friends could use
a couple of beers.''

702
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:06.311
And he got it!

703
00:54:07.511 --> 00:54:09.909
Sometimes it makes me sad. though...

704
00:54:10.209 --> 00:54:11.609
...Andy being gone.

705
00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:16.409
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren�t meant to be caged.

706
00:54:16.909 --> 00:54:19.010
Their feathers arejust too bright.

707
00:54:20.709 --> 00:54:22.409
And when they fly away...

708
00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:27.310
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

709
00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:29.609
But still...

710
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:34.409
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they�re gone.

711
00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:41.010
I guess Ijust miss my friend.

712
00:55:05.709 --> 00:55:06.609
Please sit down.

713
00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.010
Ellis Boyd Redding...

714
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:17.810
...your files say you�ve served
40 years of a life sentence.

715
00:55:18.609 --> 00:55:20.709
You feel you�ve been rehabilitated?

716
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:24.209
Rehabilitated?

717
00:55:26.209 --> 00:55:28.109
Well. now. let me see.

718
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:31.409
I don�t have any idea
what that means.

719
00:55:33.609 --> 00:55:35.810
It means you�re ready
to rejoin society--

720
00:55:36.409 --> 00:55:38.709
I know what you think it means. sonny.

721
00:55:40.909 --> 00:55:42.909
To me it�s just a made-up word.

722
00:55:44.209 --> 00:55:46.609
A politician�s word so that...

723
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.510
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

724
00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:52.609
...and have a job.

725
00:55:54.609 --> 00:55:56.709
What do you really want to know?

726
00:55:57.409 --> 00:55:59.409
Am I sorry for what I did?

727
00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.010
Well. are you?

728
00:56:02.909 --> 00:56:05.709
There�s not a day goes by
I don�t feel regret.

729
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:10.609
Not because I�m in here
or because you think I should.

730
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:16.609
I look back on the way I was then...

731
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:19.909
...a young...

732
00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.510
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

733
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.209
I want to talk to him.

734
00:56:31.209 --> 00:56:33.609
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

735
00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:36.310
Tell him the way things are.

736
00:56:38.409 --> 00:56:39.909
But I can�t.

737
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:44.010
That kid�s long gone...

738
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.010
...and this old man is all that�s left.

739
00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:50.909
I got to live with that.

740
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:54.010
Rehabilitated?

741
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.209
It�s just a bullshit word.

742
00:56:57.108 --> 00:57:01.908
So you go on and stamp your forms.
sonny. and stop wasting my time.

743
00:57:03.108 --> 00:57:05.408
Because to tell you the truth...

744
00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:07.708
...I don�t give a shit.

745
00:58:34.208 --> 00:58:35.608
Here you go. miss.

746
00:58:38.608 --> 00:58:39.608
Restroom break?

747
00:58:45.408 --> 00:58:49.908
You don�t need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

748
00:59:03.009 --> 00:59:06.108
Forty years I�ve been asking
permission to piss.

749
00:59:06.908 --> 00:59:09.908
I can�t squeeze a drop without say-so.

750
00:59:13.408 --> 00:59:15.608
There�s a harsh truth to face.

751
00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:20.108
No way I�m going to make it
on the outside.

752
00:59:28.009 --> 00:59:31.708
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

753
00:59:32.509 --> 00:59:35.009
...so maybe they�d send me back.

754
00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:42.608
Terrible thing. to live in fear.

755
00:59:43.508 --> 00:59:45.207
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

756
00:59:45.407 --> 00:59:47.308
Knew it all too well.

757
00:59:48.907 --> 00:59:52.308
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

758
00:59:52.808 --> 00:59:55.508
Where I won�t have to be afraid
all the time.

759
00:59:57.508 --> 00:59:59.907
Only one thing stops me.

760
01:00:01.308 --> 01:00:03.707
A promise I made to Andy.

761
01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:25.407
There it is.

762
01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:37.607
Much obliged. sir.

763
01:04:17.007 --> 01:04:18.206
Dear Red:

764
01:04:18.507 --> 01:04:20.906
If you�re reading this.
you�ve gotten out...

765
01:04:21.106 --> 01:04:25.206
...and if you�ve come this far.
maybe you�d come a bit further.

766
01:04:25.507 --> 01:04:28.007
You remember the name
of the town. don�t you?

767
01:04:30.307 --> 01:04:31.706
Zihuatanejo.

768
01:04:33.406 --> 01:04:37.007
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

769
01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:41.007
I�ll keep an eye out for you.
and the chessboard ready.

770
01:04:41.807 --> 01:04:43.206
Remember. Red...

771
01:04:43.606 --> 01:04:45.706
...hope is a good thing...

772
01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:47.906
...maybe the best of things.

773
01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:50.206
And no good thing ever dies.

774
01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:53.606
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

775
01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.606
...and finds you well.

776
01:04:56.106 --> 01:04:57.307
Your friend...

777
01:04:57.507 --> 01:04:58.706
...Andy.

778
01:05:32.505 --> 01:05:34.205
''Get busy living...

779
01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:36.406
...or get busy dying. ''

780
01:05:39.105 --> 01:05:41.205
That�s goddamn right.

781
01:05:46.505 --> 01:05:48.605
For the second time in my life...

782
01:05:48.806 --> 01:05:51.406
...I�m guiIty of committing a crime.

783
01:05:52.505 --> 01:05:54.406
Parole violation.

784
01:05:55.105 --> 01:05:58.705
Of course I doubt they�ll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

785
01:05:59.406 --> 01:06:01.406
Not for an old crook like me.

786
01:06:01.605 --> 01:06:03.705
Fort Hancock. Texas. please.

787
01:06:07.406 --> 01:06:12.105
I find I�m so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

788
01:06:12.505 --> 01:06:15.906
I think it�s the excitement
only a free man can feel.

789
01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:18.605
A free man at the start
of a longjourney...

790
01:06:18.806 --> 01:06:21.406
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

791
01:06:24.406 --> 01:06:27.005
I hope I can make it across the border.

792
01:06:28.505 --> 01:06:31.605
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

793
01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:37.505
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

794
01:06:39.406 --> 01:06:40.505
I hope.

795
01:06:41.305 --> 01:07:41.257
