Shane Hollander.

3
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:04.879
I wanted to introduce myself.
- OK.

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.590
<i>The two most talked-about
prospects in the world:</i>

5
00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:10.593
<i>Canada's Shane Hollander
and Russia's Ilya Rozanov.</i>

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.595
<i>Always. uh.
Hollander and Rozanov. right?</i>

7
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.556
<i>We will be seeing
each other a lot?</i>

8
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.017
<i>Yeah. Boston and Montreal
play against each other often.</i>

9
00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.893
What is your room number?

10
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.687
<i>This is such a bad idea.</i>

11
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.731
You won't tell anyone?
No one can know.

12
00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.316
<i>A lot of kids
are gonna be looking up to you.</i>

13
00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.360
- Where's your boy Rozanov?
- My what?

14
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.987
So. what's my name gonna be?
- Jane.

15
00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.283
How much pressure do you feel

16
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.743
from the fans. from
the hockey world in general?

17
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.287
- What was that?
- Not everything is about you!

18
00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.831
What the fuck are you doing?
We're in public.

19
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.958
- No one is looking.
- You don't know that!

20
00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.295
Hollander.

I fucking mean what I mean.

82
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.108
They're burning a fake Rozanov
outside right now.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.026
The fuck does that mean?

84
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.987

No. thanks.

86
00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.282

it doesn't help me focus.

Yeah. Miity.
go be weird somewhere else.

88
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.327

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:53.001
Can you talk to NBC and some

92
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.796
"Now. Mr. Hollander.

93
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.340
what does Montreal have
to do to win tonight?"

94
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.760
Well. hockey is a complicated
and nuanced game.

95
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.430
but it would be helpful
if we scored more fucking goals

96
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.389
than the other team.

97
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.726
"And how about
that other team!"

100
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.231
<i>He's almost caught up to you
in the scoring race.</i>

101
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.816
Want to know what he
said about it?

102
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.110
I'll listen if he
actually catches up. Thanks.

103
00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:58.668
Wow. this Montreal girl
works you up. brother.

104
00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.628
Shut your idiot face. Marly.

105
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:02.505
You're straight up
blushing. Roz.

106
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.424
Uh. no. Never in life
have I blushed.

107
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.050
Russians do not do this.

108
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:14.225

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.018
Good game. Good game.

110
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.443

111
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.777
Maybe.

112
00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:26.487
Get in.

113
00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:31.617
Why the fuck did you think
it was OK

114
00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.161
to sext me before the game?

115
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.412
What the fuck?

116
00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.205
You were hard. weren't you?

117
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.166
For how long?
The whole game?

118
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.835
You're such a fucking asshole.

119
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.420
You missed me. didn't you?

120
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.880
I fucking didn't.

121
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.048
And I still beat your ass.

122
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.758
Oh. barely.

123
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.099
Wow. nice place!

124
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:56.559
Thanks.

125
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.562
I bought it a couple years ago.

126
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:02.273
but then this year.
I bought another one.

127
00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:03.733
Right next door.

128
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.068
I eventually might turn it
into one place.

129
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.571
but for now I'm renting
the next door one out.

130
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.031
Mr. Businessman.

131
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.073

Mr. Landlord.

133
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:14.660
You asked.

134
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.245
No. I didn't.

135
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.469
So where do you want me?

136
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.347
In the kitchen. on the floor?

137
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.932
Fuck you.

138
00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.312
Did your mom buy
all these pillows?

139
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:44.148
No. I hired someone.

140
00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:45.983
A designer.

141
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.611
You think there is enough?

142
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.696

143
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.783

144

the cigarettes from here.

145
00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:58.663
I had one.

146
00:08:58.788 --> 00:08:59.956
You shouldn't be smoking.

147
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:01.958
And you shouldn't be talking.

148
00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:06.879

178
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.160
Now the bed's all dirty.

179
00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.495
What?

180
00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:27.830
Shut up.

181
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:32.001
<i>♪ Please don't go ♪</i>

182
00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.253

184
00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:48.642
<i>♪ Stay right here ♪</i>

185
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:59.278
Ah! You killed me. Hollander.

186
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:00.905
I am dead.

187
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.157
That was so fucking hot.

188
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.497
Worth the wait?

189
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.458

193
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.304
I should go.

194
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.390
<i>♪ It's you ♪</i>

195
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.063
So. obviously.
we won't see each other

196
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.606
during the Olympics. right?

197
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.191
Right.

198
00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:42.238
Your family must be happy
they're in Russia.

199
00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.406
Mmm. Yes.

200
00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:46.826
My parents are pretty
psyched for me.

201
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.452
They're pissed they can't come.

202
00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.955
but my mom's threatening
to wake up at 4:00 a.m.

203
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.456
to watch every game.

204
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:57.628
I bet your parents
will be there. right?

205
00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:59.547
My father. yes.

206
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.924
Maybe my brother. but who knows?

207
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.968
Cool.

208
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.344
Anyways. I'm psyched.

209
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.429
I've been dreaming
about it my whole life.

210
00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:10.266
Dreaming of what?
Bronze medal?

211
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.601
You fucking wish. dude.

212
00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:19.024
Hey. uh. remember when I
made you come hands-free?

213
00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.443
Go fuck yourself. Rozanov.

214
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.822
Such a good trick.

215
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.074
Your cab is definitely here.

216
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.335
Bye.

217
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.137

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.438
Boys.

230
00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:40.940
Holy fuck!
Can you believe Russia?

231
00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.024
Be nice. Vaughnny.

232
00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.525
They fucking
lost to Latvia.

233
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:44.610
Did you see that game?

234
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.487
Yeah. it was
a straight up shit show.

235
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.571
A debacle.

236
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.032
Hey. what did Roz
say about it?

237
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.701
I don't know. Nothing to me.
that's for sure.

238
00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:55.120
I think he knows Canada
has this in the bag.

239
00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:56.622
Uh-uh. It's USA
this year. baby.

240
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:57.706
We're coming for you.

241
00:15:57.873 --> 00:15:58.791
- OK. OK.
- Trust me.

242
00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.125
You look great in silver.

243
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.502
- Oh. good one.
- Oh!

244
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.673
Does your room
have that smell?

245
00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.216
Yes. Yes. it does.

246
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.509
Is it black mold?

247
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.552
'Cause that's what
JJ thinks it is.

248
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.887
He's probably right.

249
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:13.931
Good news is we're not
gonna be here long enough.

250
00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.392
Tonight. we can do men's
short form figure skating?

251
00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:19.019
My buddy Joe is in that
program. We trained together.

252
00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.771
Would you guys
be cool to do that?

253
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.064
I'd love to show up for him.

254
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:23.399
Hell yeah. man.

255
00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.234
Show up for any dude
who's that brave.

256
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.444
What do you mean?

257
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.948
Well. I'm assuming
your buddy might be gay.

258
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.658
I mean...

259
00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.369
Fucking brave for a dude to
show up to a place like this

260
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.996
and be like: "Hey. here's me."

261
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:40.374
Russia is not safe
for folks like that.

262
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:43.085
Fucking balls of steel. man.

263
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.485
Yeah!

264
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.862
Whoo-hoo!

265
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.488
Amazing.

266
00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.951
Wow! Man. your buddy
fucking killed it.

267
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.536
Fuck yeah. he did.

268
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.082
I'm just gonna
find the bathroom.

269
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.800
{\i1}Where the fuck are you?
Dad is so fucking mad at you!{\i}

270
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.643
Hey.

271
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.483
Not here.

272
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:48.859
No. I'm not...

273
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.154
I saw you up here. I wanted to
see how you're doing.

274
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.740
Fine. Go sit down.

275
00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.660
We...

276
00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.329
We are not anything.

277
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.707
Go away. Hollander.

278
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.756
Are you OK?

279
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.217
Please. go.

280
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.385
You didn't answer my text.

281
00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.181
No. I did not answer
your boring text.

282
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.766
Now will you go?

283
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.393
Fine.

284
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.520
Fuck.

285
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.690
You need a haircut.

286
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.070
Yes. sir.

287
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:47.120
The minister still wants to
meet you tonight. despite everything.

288
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.290
It will be my honour.

289
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.630
You should be honoured.

290
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.540
After yesterday.

291
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.300
You lose to...

292
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.970
Latvia.

293
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.300
And yet. he drinks.

294
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.100
How could you let that happen?

295
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.350
How are you not ashamed?

296
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.680
I'm ashamed. Father.

297
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.930
Not nearly enough.

298
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.230
They teach you no discipline
in the American league.

299
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.440
Your play is sloppy.

300
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.780
The real shame is squandering the promise
you showed when you were young.

301
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.610
I am a better player now
than I have ever been.

302
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.330
Our goalie is hurt.
The team didn't click.

303
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.410
Click?

304
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.080
What is this American nonsense?
What is clicking?

305
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.960
You are the captain.
You make them click!

306
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.250
Always looking for someone else to blame.

307
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.010
Since you were a boy.

308
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.850
Who tied this for you?

309
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.560
Your mother?

310
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.180
She doesn't know how to do this properly.

311
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.230
No. Father.

312
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.360
Mom is dead.

313
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.530
You remember?

314
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.070
I meant your stepmother.

315
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.990
And where is Polina?

316
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.750
In Moscow?

317
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.170
Of course.

318
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.250
We should go.

319
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.130
To the gala.

320
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.680
So that I can meet the minister.

321
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.350
Yes. Ready?

322
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.730
Let's go.

323
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:40.360
It always comes down to goaltending
and Vadilevich. well...

324
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.360
He was not sharp. but...

325
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:49.080
And Kitchov stays home
to rest for American prizes.

326
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.500
Too good for his country now.

327
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.160
Terrible. yes. terrible.

328
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.330
But there was no leadership.

329
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.420
That is always the problem. Leadership.

330
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.090
Too much confidence?

331
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.760
Ilya?

332
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.590
Or too much pressure maybe?

333
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.010
Too much talking. Mr. Minister. probably.

334
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:13.980
But you love talking
about hockey. my angel.

335
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.190
Only when we're winning. Daddy.

336
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.400
I'm taking Ilya with me to the bar.
He clearly needs another drink.

337
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.320
Always leading him around.

338
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.200
Since they were children.

339
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.320
Thank you.

340
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.700
I'm an angel. It would be great
if you could remember that.

341
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.870
I want a drink.

342
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.330
But I have something more fun in mind.

343
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.930
Long time. Ilya.

344
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.400
Long time. Sasha.

345
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.110
I don't think you played that badly.

346
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.870
I'd say thank you. but I know
you didn't watch a single fucking game.

347
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.990
For someone whose father has been
a hockey coach your whole life.

348
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.950
you sure have managed to avoid it.

349
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.870
I pay attention sometimes.

350
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.840
When there's something
worth paying attention to.

351
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.590
Anyway. ultimately.
it doesn't matter for you.

352
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.210
It doesn't?

353
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.180
How do you figure that? My father...

354
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.600
Your father is an asshole
who would have punished you either way.

355
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.390
You need to stop
giving a fuck what he thinks.

356
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:41.690
And fuck these stupid games when
you have a real shot at the Cup this year.

357
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.690
I do?

358
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.940
Yes. you do.

359
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.360
Hunter and the Admirals
won't get past New Jersey.

360
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.280
But New Jersey won't get
past Hollander and Montreal.

361
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.120
I think this year.
you can take Montreal.

362
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.490
- This year?
- Yes.

363
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.660
This year.
because I think Miitka is hurt.

364
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.080
How do you know all this?

365
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.920
She's psychic.

366
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.380
And with a hurt goalie.
you can only go so far.

367
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.720
As you and your team
proved rather well here.

368
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.760
Touché.

369
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.310
And that's the East.
Then you can take anyone in the West.

370
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.310
Chicago ain't what they used to be.

371
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:27.610
It'll probably end up being San Francisco.
They're good but they're too young.

372
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.570
That's how you end up winning the Cup

373
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.030
one year earlier
than I bet my father you would.

374
00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:36.415
Mmm.

375
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.580
No thanks. Now it's bedtime for me.
I have to look perfect tomorrow.

376
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.250
You always look perfect.

377
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:47.750
True. But you boys
also need to catch up.

378
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.220
See you in Boston. Ilya.

379
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.510
Bye-bye.

380
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.890
So?

381
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.730
How's Paris. Sasha?

382
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.230
Oh. it's great. thanks.

383
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.990
I fucking love it there.

384
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.950
The clubs are insane.

385
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.320
The girls are hot.

386
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.490
And the boys.

387
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:26.460
Well. you've seen French boys.
right. Ilya?

388
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.550
Oh my God. nothing?

389
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.720
You don't do coke.

390
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.600
you don't make jokes.

391
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.480
you don't flirt back...

392
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.740
You used to be fun. Ilya.

393
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.660
Remember?

394
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.130
Here? Really?

395
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.930
Danger used to get you going.
if memory serves.

396
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.060
We're not kids anymore. Sasha.

397
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.690
We're sure not.

398
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.780
Stop.

399
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.660
OK. let's go somewhere.

400
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:41.790
No.

401
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.340
Fine. I'm gonna find a party.

402
00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:57.138
OK.

403
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.680
Bye. Ilya.

404
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.940
Nice to see you. Sasha.

405
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.708
Hey!

406
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.167
Captain's here.

407
00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:28.211
-  Cap! Cap! Cap!
- Shhh!

408
00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.838
Oh my God!
I just put them down.

409
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.840
What--what am I supposed
to do with this?

410
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.675
I don't know.
My mom told me to get wine.

411
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.634
Oh my God.

412
00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:36.928
You're so cute.

413
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:38.930
There's ginger ale
in the fridge.

414
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:41.016
Playoffs are over.
You can't keep the beard.

415
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:42.767
That's not a rule.
You made that up.

416
00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:44.144
Hollander. is that a rule?

417
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.270
Unfortunately. it is.

418
00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:46.354
Fuck you. Hollander!

419
00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:47.647
He can barely even grow one.

420
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.566
No. no. fuck you.
Swedish inbred.

421
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:50.692
- Fuck you. JJ.
- Come on.

422
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.027
Just fucking do it.

423
00:26:52.193 --> 00:26:53.361
Stop swearing!

424
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:55.697
Boys. it's starting.

425
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:56.740
Turn it up.

426
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.283
<i>It's Game 6.</i>

427
00:26:58.408 --> 00:27:00.243
<i>and the Cup is
somewhere inside as we speak.</i>

428
00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:03.872
<i>You know that Ilya Rozanov
wants this bad.</i>

429
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.582
<i>Him and the Raiders
have been on fire</i>

430
00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:06.875
<i>since the Olympic break.</i>

431
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.376
<i>A heartbreak for the Russians</i>

432
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:09.711
<i>seems to have only intensified</i>

433
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:11.713
<i>the young Boston captain.</i>

434
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.381
<i>He's on a tear.</i>

435
00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:15.884
<i>scoring 10 goals over
the past 6 playoff games.</i>

436
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.053
OK. listen the fuck up!

437
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:22.599
Look. I don't give a fuck
how many goals I've scored.

438
00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:26.227
I don't give a fuck how I
played two fucking nights ago.

439
00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.021
I don't need to
think about that.

440
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.398
That was yesterday.
That was before.

441
00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:34.069
Now. I only need one thing.

442
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:38.615
I need to win.

443
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.785
Here. at home. tonight.

444
00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.538
As much fun as it would
be to go to California

445
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.040
and humiliate them there.

446
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.000
but I want to hear our fans.

447
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.711
I want to hear them scream.

448
00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:55.340
I want to fuck San Francisco.

449
00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.426
I know you can do it.

450
00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:00.053
I've seen you fucking do it.

451
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.722
I've seen every one of you
do it.

452
00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.850
So leave it all
the fuck out there tonight.

453
00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:11.815
Because this is
our fucking night.

454
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.734
This is our fucking Cup.

455
00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:17.654
Fucking fuck San Francisco!

456
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.451
Great fucking speech.

457
00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:24.786
Go fuck yourself.

458
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.668
I can't believe that asshole's
about to win the Cup.

459
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.837
Shane hates him the most.

460
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.797
- What?
- You hate Rozanov.

461
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:36.965
Of course.

462
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.509
But he's very good at hockey.

463
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:41.136
The best. probably.

464
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:43.763
Uh. no. You're the
fucking best. Hollander.

465
00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.306
Yeah.

466
00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:48.309
Not that animal shit show
cock sucking Russian.

467
00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.603
<i>And that is that.</i>

468
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.981
<i>The Boston Raiders are your
MLH champions.</i>

469
00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:55.066
- Oh.
- Let's start the grill.

470
00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:57.652
<i>What a comeback story
this year for Ilya Rozanov.</i>

471
00:28:57.777 --> 00:29:00.613
<i>The captain did absolutely
everything in these playoffs.</i>

472
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:03.450
<i>leading his team in
blocked shots and shots against.</i>

473
00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.034
<i>And obviously. it...</i>

474
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.486
Wow. nice watch! They give
this to you for free or what?

475
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.863
Where the fuck were you?
We're on in 5 seconds.

476
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.031
25 seconds.

477
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:45.033
What were you even doing?

478
00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:48.620
And now. presenting
the Lord Talon Award...

479
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:49.871
I was busy.

480
00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:51.206
With who?

481
00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:54.042
...Ilya Rozanov
and Shane Hollander.

482
00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:02.008
But the most
important thing...

483
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.803
...is the friends
we make along the way.

484
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.765
Hey. before we give out
next award.

485
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.725
can I get a selfie with you?

486
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.352
What?

487
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:15.230
Come on. When will this
ever happen again. buddy?

488
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.232
OK. fine. but hurry up.

489
00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:26.741
Great! Give me your number.
I'll text them to you.

490
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.409
No chance.

491
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:31.079
And the Lord Talon Award

492
00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:33.581
for most sportsmanlike
player goes to...

493
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:15.540
Well...

494
00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:19.043
What?

495
00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:21.671
What the fuck
do you want. Rozanov?

496
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:25.008
You haven't answered a text
from me in. like. 6 months.

497
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.551
You won't even
acknowledge I exist

498
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.137
unless there's a fucking
camera pointed at us.

499
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:31.639
and then it's for some
fucking clown show.

500
00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:35.310
So yeah. what the fuck
do you actually want from me?

501
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:38.313
Well?

502
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.483
I want you to suck my dick.

503
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:44.819
Oh. fuck you.
You are unbelievable.

504
00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:46.988
You suck my dick.

505
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.295
Maybe ask nicely.

506
00:32:07.508 --> 00:32:08.885
Hmm?

507
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.678
Please.

508
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.683
If you want me
to get on my knees

509
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.394
on this filthy bathroom floor
and suck your dick.

510
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:21.356
you will have to
ask nicer than that.

511
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:26.778
Please get on your knees

512
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:29.864
on this filthy bathroom floor

513
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:32.158
and suck my dick.

514
00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:34.702
Please.

515
00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:45.964
No.

516
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:49.801
What?

517
00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:51.344
No.

518
00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:54.639
We will go back to our seats.

519
00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:57.350
watch the rest
of this boring show.

520
00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.727
and then go to
boring party after.

521
00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:04.273
And then. when you have been
waiting all night.

522
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.776
you'll come back to
my hotel room.

523
00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.653
and I will maybe...

524
00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:12.532
maybe do more
than just suck your dick.

525
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:17.203
When did your English
get so good?

526
00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:21.249
I. uh. I read
the <i>New Yorker</i> now.

527
00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:23.251
Really?

528
00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:26.254
No. The <i>New Yorker</i> is boring.

529
00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:29.507
My dad loves it.

530
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.721
Ah. So being boring
is--is genetic.

531
00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:35.888
Wow.

532
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:37.557
Genetic.

533
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.521
Then let's make a deal.

534
00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:46.107
If you win MVP tonight.

535
00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:49.277
I will blow you.
fuck you. whatever you want.

536
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.781
And if you win?

537
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:13.134
Good luck tonight.

538
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.180
Congratulations.

539
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:00.890
Thank you.

540
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:02.934
Now take off your clothes.

541
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.853
You're such an asshole.

542
00:35:50.606 --> 00:35:51.774
What?

543
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:54.735
Just a lot of windows.

544
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.717
Good.

545
00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.427
Now get on the bed.

546
00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:27.977
This is a good hotel.

547
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:29.312
Very nice vodka.

548
00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:31.439
It's hard to find in America.

549
00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:33.733
OK...

550
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.069
Touch yourself.

551
00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:38.988
- What?
- Show off for me.

552
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:39.947
I want to watch you.

553
00:36:40.114 --> 00:36:41.449
You what?

554
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.868
It's my special day.
Hollander. I want to watch.

555
00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:45.786
I've never...

556
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:46.871
No shit.

557
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.164
Fuck you.

558
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.291
Give me some vodka. at least.

559
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:51.542
Mmm. no. no. no.

560
00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:53.920
Vodka is for after.
as your reward.

561
00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:30.998
Do you want to know
how it feels?

562
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.335
How what feels?

563
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.045
Holding the Cup.

564
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.130
You fucking asshole.

565
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.507
Ah. I can barely describe it.

566
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:41.342
Oh my God. Hollander.

567
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.387
Ah!

568
00:37:54.397 --> 00:37:56.565
Fuck.

569
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.866
Are you gonna fuck me?

570
00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.702
We will see.

571
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:11.580
I need...

572
00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:14.125
What?

573
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.710
You know.

574
00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:17.628
Tell me.

575
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.840
You.

576
00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:27.513
I need you.

577
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:30.349
Hmm.

578
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:30.534
So. Russia this year
was something else.

579
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.123
It's intense there.

580
00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.422
So are you heading back soon?

581
00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.007
Back?

582
00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:47.927
To Russia for the summer?

583
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:50.471
Oh. yes.

584
00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:57.812
Why?

585
00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.314
What do you mean. why?

586
00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:03.692
Do you have to?

587
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:07.154
There is no "have to." It's...

588
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:09.115
It's home.

589
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.077
Yeah. but I don't know.

590
00:40:13.202 --> 00:40:14.537
Is it safe?

591
00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.456
What do you mean. "safe"?

592
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:20.126
I don't know.

593
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.838
Do you--do you even
like it there?

594
00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:31.679
What difference does it make?

595
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.598
A pretty big one. I think.

596
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.897
I need to sleep.

597
00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:44.275
Oh.

598
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.152
Yeah. me too.

599
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.028
I should. uh...

600
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:57.538
So. uh. I'm off.

601
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.041
Goodbye. Hollander.

602
00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:19.203
Fuck.
