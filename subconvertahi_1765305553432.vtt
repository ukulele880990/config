﻿1
00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:40.723
Nowadays. the US
government can listen to anything you say.

2
00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:44.143
They know where you are.
they know who you're talking to.

3
00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:47.605
and trust me.
they know who you're fucking.

4
00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer.
and you're doomed.

5
00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:56.656
But in Colombia in 1989.
it wasn't that easy.

6
00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.950
First off.
there was no Internet.

7
00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.451
No cells.

8
00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:02.203
The best they had were satellite phones.

9
00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:06.541
and in order to capture a satellite phone.
you had to fly directly over it.

10
00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:10.920
On top of that. the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

11
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.381
the landowners. the politicians...

12
00:01:14.757 --> 00:01:18.469
And lucky for us.
the narcos were richer than them all.

13
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.944
And once you got a signal.
you didn't know who you were listening to.

14
00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.614
That's why back then. the US government
developed software that could identify

15
00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.158
the voices of our targets.

16
00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:45.371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz.
gentlemen.

17
00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:48.499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

18
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.960
Hammer. prepare to engage.

19
00:01:51.168 --> 00:01:54.463
Once we got a target.
we still had to locate it.

20
00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:58.300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

21
00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:04.057
OK. he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

22
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.308
Hawkeye. how do you copy that?

23
00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.938
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

24
00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it.

25
00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.910
but he'd just made himself a date.

26
00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:27.914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

27
00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:29.874
Hammer. disengage.

28
00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

29
00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

30
00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

31
00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:42.470
By "the other guy." he meant me.

32
00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:45.723
I'm Steve Murphy.
Drug Enforcement Agent.

33
00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:50.352
And as you can see.
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

34
00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.479
Hello?

35
00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:54.023
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

36
00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:54.941
Got it.

37
00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

38
00:02:57.735 --> 00:02:59.070
OK.

39
00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:01.739
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself.

40
00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:05.160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

41
00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:09.246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

42
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.498
Hola.

43
00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.167
In case you're wondering.
this is the asshole.

44
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.128
Javier Peña. my partner.

45
00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.715
And this is Colonel Carrillo.
the leader of the Search Bloc.

46
00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

47
00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:06.637
Boy. did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

48
00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:14.436
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

49
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.355
Especially the local hitmen.

50
00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:18.191
Colombians call them sicarios.

51
00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:26.615
Now. Poison. he was one of the best.

52
00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:30.619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

53
00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.163
Probably hundreds.

54
00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.040
But don't get me wrong.

55
00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:37.376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

56
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

57
00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:20.253
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

58
00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.676
Yeah. I pushed the buttons.

59
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.191
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

60
00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:10.748

61
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.367
My fellow Americans...

62
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.785
Take Richard Nixon. for instance.

63
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:20.956
People forget.
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

64
00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.959
We thought he was one of the good guys.

65
00:07:24.168 --> 00:07:27.255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

66
00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:29.048
because he hated the commies.

67
00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:31.717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

68
00:07:36.597 --> 00:07:39.934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

69
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:45.689
Maybe not such a good guy after all.

70
00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:55.241
But sometimes.
bad guys do good things.

71
00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.705
Nobody knows this. but back in '73.
Chile was on its way

72
00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:05.709
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

73
00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:14.302
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

74
00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:15.511
to ship the product north.

75
00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.481
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

76
00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:33.862
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

77
00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:39.994
And then. being Pinochet...

78
00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:43.080
he had them all killed.

79
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:07.896
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world.

80
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.900
only the cockroaches will survive.

81
00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.694
I guess they were right.

82
00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:20.951
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno.
aka Cockroach.

83
00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:23.287
and he was smart enough to play dead.

84
00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.501
He wasn't killed on that day.

85
00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:33.922
Instead. he won the damn lottery.

86
00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:41.013
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

87
00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:44.433
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

88
00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:48.020
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

89
00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:12.253
Back then. we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

90
00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:15.172
on the human brain.

91
00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:18.509
We didn't know much. but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

92
00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.928
...this will give us better results. OK?

93
00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:24.223
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

94
00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:27.518
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

95
00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:33.441
It would choose cocaine over sleep.
over sex... over life itself.

96
00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:36.652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

97
00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:40.906
unless we're talking about cocaine.

98
00:10:47.204 --> 00:10:49.373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

99
00:10:50.374 --> 00:10:52.709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

100
00:10:52.793 --> 00:10:54.169
Gracias.

101
00:10:56.213 --> 00:10:58.924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

102
00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.348
Like Goldilocks.
he had three options.

103
00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:09.685
And pay attention. because all three
are important to this story.

104
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge. that's Fabio on the horse.

105
00:11:17.652 --> 00:11:21.363
A typical Colombian smuggling family.

106
00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.865
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

107
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.119
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

108
00:11:28.162 --> 00:11:31.957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha.

109
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.836
nicknamed "The Mexican."
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

110
00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:38.714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

111
00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:49.183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade.
even by Colombian standards.

112
00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:50.767
If you make it to the top...

113
00:11:52.227 --> 00:11:55.230
it means you've killed your enemies.

114
00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:01.195
And sometimes. your partners.

115
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

116
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

117
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.761
Yeah. you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

118
00:12:25.844 --> 00:12:28.180
The man who would
change my life forever.

119
00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:33.394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

120
00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:35.937
Cigarettes. alcohol. marijuana.
you name it.

121
00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.817
At the time.
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

122
00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:45.406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

123
00:12:46.574 --> 00:12:48.701
They didn't play by the same rules.

124
00:12:50.244 --> 00:12:51.579
Good day.

125
00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.383
Yo. Pablo!

126
00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:10.582
Back then. Miami was a paradise.

127
00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:13.543
I signed up for the sand.
surf and women.

128
00:19:15.253 --> 00:19:18.465
In '79. the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

129
00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:19.716
DEA! Stop!

130
00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:23.929
I was a young DEA agent.
partnered with my buddy. Kevin Brady.

131
00:19:25.139 --> 00:19:27.182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

132
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.728
Why you running. huh?

133
00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

134
00:19:34.898 --> 00:19:35.816
What is that?

135
00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:39.027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

136
00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:41.196
Let's go celebrate.

137
00:19:41.404 --> 00:19:42.864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

138
00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:47.828
Go! Go! Go!

139
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:50.371
How you like me now?

140
00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:51.623
How much money you owe me?

141
00:19:51.832 --> 00:19:53.458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

142
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:55.169
That's right. that's right.

143
00:19:57.754 --> 00:20:00.757
All right.
All right. who do we pick?

144
00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.467
How 'bout her?

145
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.969
No. no. no.
we gotta fuck with him.

146
00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:06.054
- Yeah. let's mess with his head.
- Um...

147
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.973
Oh. right there.
See her? At the bar?

148
00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:10.184
- Which one?
- Blue top. blond hair. That's his type.

149
00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:13.353
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

150
00:20:13.436 --> 00:20:14.729
- All right.
- Whoo!

151
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.940
Murph! Sparrow. three o'clock.

152
00:20:17.024 --> 00:20:20.861
Hey. while you were walking back.
she was checking your ass out.

153
00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:22.487
Oh. she was checking out your ass.

154
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

155
00:20:24.072 --> 00:20:27.951
Listen. she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

156
00:20:28.035 --> 00:20:30.704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

157
00:20:30.912 --> 00:20:34.332
I'm serious. I'm serious. Look at her.

158
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:37.127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

159
00:20:37.211 --> 00:20:38.753
No. the other one.
Of course the blond one.

160
00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.547
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

161
00:20:41.297 --> 00:20:44.592
You dicking me around?

162
00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:48.930
Fuck it. I'm going in.

163
00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:50.182
- Go get her.
- Mm!

164
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:52.059
- Yup.
- Hey. while you're up there.

165
00:20:52.142 --> 00:20:53.643
get us another pitcher. will ya?

166
00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:56.855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

167
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.366
How you doing?

168
00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.202
Busy.

169
00:21:11.828 --> 00:21:15.331
I just said. "Look. if you don't
wanna be there. you don't have to be.

170
00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:18.626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So. I don't know...

171
00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.674
Yeah. those bastards got me.

172
00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:27.094
But I couldn't let it end like that.

173
00:21:27.177 --> 00:21:30.013
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

174
00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:32.599
Uh. they're fucking with me.

175
00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:36.144
Telling me you were checking out my ass.
and who checks out a cop's ass. right?

176
00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.478
You're a cop?

177
00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.898
Not a cop. actually. I'm DEA.

178
00:21:40.107 --> 00:21:41.149
Drug Enforcement?

179
00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:43.235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

180
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.613
Come on. why don't you do me a favor?

181
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:49.283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you. uh...

182
00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:51.076
give me your phone number?

183
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.494
How about a fake number?

184
00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.580
That'll work.

185
00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:58.125
Hey. buddy. you got a pen?

186
00:22:12.806 --> 00:22:15.391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

187
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.894
Have a good night.

188
00:22:20.563 --> 00:22:23.275
Aah...

189
00:22:23.358 --> 00:22:24.525
Shot down!

190
00:22:25.693 --> 00:22:28.363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh. I...

191
00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:30.531
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

192
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

193
00:22:34.077 --> 00:22:36.537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

194
00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.290
How much did that cost you?

195
00:22:38.373 --> 00:22:40.500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

196
00:22:47.215 --> 00:22:49.592
I figured. what the hell.

197
00:22:49.676 --> 00:22:53.096
Worst that could happen.
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

198
00:22:59.477 --> 00:23:00.687
Hello?

199
00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:03.648
So it wasn't a fake.

200
00:23:03.857 --> 00:23:06.193
I thought you might figure it out.

201
00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:08.695
After all. you're DEA.

202
00:23:08.778 --> 00:23:12.157
And just like that... she had me.

203
00:23:13.574 --> 00:23:18.621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru.

204
00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:20.498
cocaine had him.

205
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:24.919
It's been a while.

206
00:23:35.138 --> 00:23:36.681
You sure?

207
00:25:58.406 --> 00:26:02.160
That's half a million dollars... per trip.

208
00:26:02.243 --> 00:26:05.372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

209
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.959
Easiest money he ever made.

210
00:26:15.298 --> 00:26:18.218
Back in Medellín.
Pablo didn't waste any time.

211
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:19.969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

212
00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:25.099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

213
00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

214
00:26:57.424 --> 00:27:01.719
It was a mom-and-pop operation.
so small they called it The Kitchen.

215
00:27:01.802 --> 00:27:05.557
But make no mistake.
it would change Medellín forever.

216
00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:33.167
There you go.

217
00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:49.767
- Come on.

218
00:27:55.148 --> 00:27:58.985
Like her son. Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

219
00:28:22.883 --> 00:28:26.429
Pablo loved his young bride Tata.
and she loved him.

220
00:28:26.513 --> 00:28:28.931
He was a family man till the end.

221
00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:32.185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

222
00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:38.525
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

223
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.830
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

224
00:29:37.917 --> 00:29:39.252
Welcome to the United States.

225
00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:42.004
Thank you.
Have a great day.

226
00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:42.963
Next. please.

227
00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:46.842
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder.

228
00:29:46.926 --> 00:29:51.806
half Colombian. half German.
and 100 percent playboy.

229
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:55.184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

230
00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:57.061
Go figure.

231
00:29:57.144 --> 00:30:01.065
Back in '79. this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

232
00:30:01.148 --> 00:30:02.734
on a fleet of small planes.

233
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.288
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

234
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:59.666
Drugs in. cash out.

235
00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:03.002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

236
00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:06.547
And in no time.
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

237
00:31:07.674 --> 00:31:10.217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes.

238
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:12.679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

239
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:15.765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

240
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

241
00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

242
00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:25.817
Ten trucks. 20 kilos each.
going back and forth every day...

243
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

244
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.448
Pretty soon.
the Lion had to come up with new ways

245
00:31:32.532 --> 00:31:34.617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

246
00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:03.437
- See you later.
- Later.

247
00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:46.355
During the early '80s.
most flights out of Bogotá

248
00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:48.274
had several mules on them.

249
00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:50.443
They didn't even know about each other.

250
00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:52.111
And you know what?

251
00:32:52.194 --> 00:32:56.323
Getting in was easy. because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

252
00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:58.367
All we cared about was grass.

253
00:33:01.454 --> 00:33:05.959
Pretty soon. cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

254
00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:10.087
Fish. coffee. flowers. rubber hoses...
anything.

255
00:33:27.229 --> 00:33:29.148
But even that didn't do it.

256
00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:34.487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

257
00:33:51.337 --> 00:33:52.964
- Amigos!

258
00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.

259
00:35:00.114 --> 00:35:01.908
Within months after meeting Cockroach.

260
00:35:01.991 --> 00:35:07.080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

261
00:35:08.414 --> 00:35:11.751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics. folks.

262
00:35:12.752 --> 00:35:15.922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

263
00:35:16.005 --> 00:35:17.506
in the middle of the jungle.

264
00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:22.553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest.

265
00:35:22.636 --> 00:35:27.641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

266
00:35:47.286 --> 00:35:48.370
Hey. Gustavo.

267
00:36:31.371 --> 00:36:34.458
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

268
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:38.212
They were violent. crazy and filthy rich.

269
00:36:38.295 --> 00:36:41.507
Guys used to getting what they want.
one way or another.

270
00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:47.841
When I started. a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

271
00:38:54.056 --> 00:38:57.768
And before long.
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

272
00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

273
00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:12.325
Truth is.
we weren't even making a dent.

274
00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:16.578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

275
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.007
Pablo's coke flooded in.

276
00:39:29.049 --> 00:39:31.551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

277
00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.095
And I mean that.

278
00:39:33.929 --> 00:39:37.350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

279
00:39:38.851 --> 00:39:40.353
And with the money...

280
00:39:41.436 --> 00:39:43.314
came the violence.

281
00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:47.484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians.

282
00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:50.237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

283
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

284
00:40:18.807 --> 00:40:21.143
Use 'em once.
then throw 'em away.

285
00:40:22.561 --> 00:40:26.648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

286
00:40:26.732 --> 00:40:29.609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

287
00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.653
to hold all the extra corpses.

288
00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.699
That was the first person I ever shot.

289
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

290
00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:01.975
Hey... it was self-defense.

291
00:41:02.184 --> 00:41:05.145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

292
00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

293
00:41:09.149 --> 00:41:10.776
He sells drugs. right?

294
00:41:12.194 --> 00:41:14.071
- Yeah.
- Yeah. then fuck him.

295
00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:22.371
What happened?

296
00:41:25.665 --> 00:41:28.210
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

297
00:41:28.461 --> 00:41:30.545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

298
00:41:30.629 --> 00:41:31.964
Stay with me.

299
00:41:32.172 --> 00:41:33.632
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

300
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

301
00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:41.265
By the time she got to us.
she was barely breathing.

302
00:41:41.348 --> 00:41:45.102
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils. rapid pulse.

303
00:41:45.185 --> 00:41:47.646
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

304
00:41:47.729 --> 00:41:51.442
...but she had no residue on her nostrils.
no injection marks.

305
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.654
We did everything we could.

306
00:41:56.738 --> 00:41:58.365
She died in the ER.

307
00:42:00.742 --> 00:42:02.536
We tried to save the baby...

308
00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:10.085
The baby died in my hands.

309
00:42:12.838 --> 00:42:14.340
I'm so sorry.

310
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

311
00:42:19.011 --> 00:42:20.720
Two of the pellets split open.

312
00:42:22.597 --> 00:42:26.268
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

313
00:42:28.562 --> 00:42:30.272
No one survives that.

314
00:43:13.148 --> 00:43:15.234
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

315
00:43:15.442 --> 00:43:18.695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

316
00:43:18.778 --> 00:43:22.616
Instead. he found another way
to get his fair share.

317
00:46:56.996 --> 00:46:59.499
Pablo didn't know it then...

318
00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:03.336
...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

319
00:48:48.441 --> 00:48:51.820
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

320
00:48:51.904 --> 00:48:55.073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities.

321
00:48:55.156 --> 00:48:58.827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami. too.

322
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:06.125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata.
a Colombian with a plumbing business

323
00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:08.921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

324
00:49:10.088 --> 00:49:14.843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

325
00:49:18.137 --> 00:49:19.723
The plan was to trade vehicles.

326
00:49:19.806 --> 00:49:22.893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

327
00:49:24.519 --> 00:49:27.105
1200 kilos.

328
00:49:27.188 --> 00:49:30.024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

329
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:33.612
OK. gringos.

330
00:49:33.695 --> 00:49:35.697
How's the plumbing business?

331
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:37.115
Fine.

332
00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:43.580
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

333
00:49:45.373 --> 00:49:47.500
Come on. amigo.
I'll show you.

334
00:49:49.085 --> 00:49:50.629
Everything was going perfect.

335
00:49:50.837 --> 00:49:55.717
Like I said. amigo...
100 percent pure.

336
00:49:55.801 --> 00:49:57.719
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

337
00:49:57.803 --> 00:50:00.472
Got a full load here. Murph--

338
00:50:08.062 --> 00:50:10.690
Don't move! Don't move.

339
00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:13.902
Don't move! Don't move.

340
00:50:13.986 --> 00:50:15.278
Get down!

341
00:50:18.698 --> 00:50:21.034
Hands! Down!

342
00:50:21.117 --> 00:50:22.201
Don't look at me.

343
00:50:25.705 --> 00:50:26.915
Fucking...

344
00:50:46.518 --> 00:50:51.064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz.

345
00:50:51.147 --> 00:50:54.275
after taking into account
all due considerations.

346
00:50:54.359 --> 00:50:59.572
bail has been set at two million dollars.
or a bond of $200.000.

347
00:51:00.907 --> 00:51:04.243
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

348
00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:07.413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

349
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:13.086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars.

350
00:51:13.169 --> 00:51:17.883
paid by a wire transfer from. well...
why don't you take a guess?

351
00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:22.428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

352
00:51:25.223 --> 00:51:31.563
From '79 to '84.
there were 3.245 murders in Miami.

353
00:51:32.647 --> 00:51:34.858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops.

354
00:51:35.067 --> 00:51:37.360
no one much cared about that.

355
00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:41.907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

356
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:46.536
Billions of dollars a year.
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

357
00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:50.623
And that... America couldn't take.

358
00:51:52.208 --> 00:51:56.462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

359
00:51:56.671 --> 00:52:00.717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

360
00:52:01.634 --> 00:52:06.098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

361
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.601
Whatever it was. the businessmen
came at just the right time.

362
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:12.520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

363
00:52:12.604 --> 00:52:15.982
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

364
00:52:16.816 --> 00:52:19.235
Drugs are menacing our society.

365
00:52:19.318 --> 00:52:22.864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

366
00:52:22.948 --> 00:52:25.033
They're killing our children.

367
00:52:25.117 --> 00:52:26.910
It was classic Reagan.

368
00:52:26.993 --> 00:52:29.913
Folksy. direct and tough.

369
00:52:29.996 --> 00:52:33.249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

370
00:52:33.458 --> 00:52:35.668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

371
00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:39.965
So to my young friends out there.
life can be great.

372
00:52:40.048 --> 00:52:42.175
But not when you can't see it.

373
00:52:42.258 --> 00:52:47.472
So open your eyes to life. to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

374
00:52:47.555 --> 00:52:49.849
as a precious gift to His children.

375
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.935
Say yes to your life.

376
00:52:52.018 --> 00:52:56.314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

377
00:53:04.656 --> 00:53:08.034
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world.

378
00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.120
only the cockroaches will survive.

379
00:53:12.413 --> 00:53:14.290
I guess they were wrong.

380
00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:19.337
During his career.
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

381
00:53:20.213 --> 00:53:22.132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

382
00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:31.933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

383
00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:34.186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

384
00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.604
No way.

385
00:53:37.271 --> 00:53:41.818
He was a West Virginia farm boy.
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

386
00:53:42.777 --> 00:53:45.613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

387
00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:48.158
It was his duty.

388
00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.953
Cocaine in Miami?

389
00:53:52.037 --> 00:53:53.955
Kilos from Colombia?

390
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.333
This was my war.

391
00:53:57.416 --> 00:53:59.919
This was my duty.

392
00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.796
And I was ready to fight it.

393
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me. too.

394
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:05.758
Your ticket. please.

395
00:54:07.135 --> 00:54:08.302
OK.

396
00:54:08.386 --> 00:54:11.389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

397
00:54:12.765 --> 00:54:17.062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

398
00:54:17.145 --> 00:54:18.813
OK. man. what do we got?

399
00:54:18.897 --> 00:54:22.025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

400
00:54:22.108 --> 00:54:23.442
We got Lizard.

401
00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:26.320
Uh...

402
00:54:26.404 --> 00:54:27.822
We got. we got...

403
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

404
00:54:33.619 --> 00:54:36.289
- Thank you for the gift. agent.
- No problem.

405
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:55.975
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world.

406
00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:59.062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

407
00:55:00.105 --> 00:55:03.775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

408
00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:08.947
In the world of drug dealers.
you do what you think is right...

409
00:55:09.864 --> 00:55:11.908
and hope for the best.
