1
00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.780
Whenever I get gloomy with
the state of the world.

2
00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:20.002
I think about the arrivals
gate at Heathrow airport.

3
00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:23.954
General opinion makes out that we
live in a world of hatred and greed

4
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.747
but I don't see that.

5
00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.374
Seems to me that love is everywhere.

6
00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:33.004
Often it's not particularly dignified
or newsworthy but it's always there.

7
00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:36.716
Fathers and sons. mothers
and daughters. husbands and wives.

8
00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:39.719
boyfriends. girlfriends. old friends.

9
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:41.981
When the planes hit the Twin Towers.

10
00:01:42.023 --> 00:01:46.768
none of the phone calls from people on
board were messages of hate or revenge.

11
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.145
they were all messages of love.

12
00:01:49.197 --> 00:01:55.651
If you look for it. I've got a sneaky feeling
you'll find that love actually is all around.

13
00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:13.971
<i># I feel it in my fingers</i>

14
00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:17.213
<i># I feel it in my toes</i>

15
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:21.843
<i># Feel it in my toes. yeah</i>

16
00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:26.473
<i># Love is all around me
And so the...</i>

17
00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:29.444
I'm afraid you did it again. Bill.

18
00:02:29.486 --> 00:02:33.897
It's just I know the old
version so well. you know.

19
00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.232
Well. we all do.

20
00:02:36.284 --> 00:02:38.693
That's why we're making the new version.

21
00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.486
Right. OK. let's go.

22
00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:47.327
<i># I feel it in my fingers... In my fingers</i>

23
00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.548
<i># I feel it in my toes</i>

24
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.053
<i># Feel it in my toes. yeah</i>

25
00:02:55.095 --> 00:02:57.670
<i># Love is all ar...</i>

26
00:02:57.722 --> 00:03:01.590
Oh. fuck. wank. bugger.
shitting arsehead and hole.

27
00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:05.719
Start again.

28
00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:14.071
<i># I feel it in my fingers... In my fingers</i>

29
00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:17.115
<i># I feel it in my toes</i>

30
00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:21.871
<i># Feel it in my toes. yeah</i>

31
00:03:21.912 --> 00:03:25.447
<i># Christmas is all
around me... All around me</i>

32
00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.700
<i># And so the feeling grows</i>

33
00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:33.246
<i># So the feeling grows</i>

34
00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.802
<i># It's written in the wind... In the wind</i>

35
00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:39.512
<i># It's everywhere I go</i>

36
00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:44.299
<i># Everywhere I go</i>

37
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:48.052
<i># So if you really love
Christmas... Love Christmas</i>

38
00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:50.721
<i># Come on and let it snow</i>

39
00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:52.817
<i># Come on and let it...</i>

40
00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.143
This is shit. isn't it?

41
00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.895
Yep. solid gold shit. maestro.

42
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.630
- God. I'm so late.
- It's just round the corner. you'll make it.

43
00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:28.967
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

44
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.428
No. really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

45
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.181
- I love you.
- I know.

46
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:38.362
I love you even when you're
sick and look disgusting.

47
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.938
I know. Now. go or you
will actually miss it.

48
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.784
Right.

49
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:51.124
- Did I mention that I love you?
- Yes. you did. Get out. loser.

50
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.185
Karen. it's me again.

51
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:15.804
I'm sorry. I literally don't
have anybody else to talk to.

52
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.986
Absolutely. Horrible moment.
though. Can I call you back?

53
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.519
Of course.

54
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.522
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly
concerned that your wife just died.

55
00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:27.785
Understood.

56
00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:30.235
Er. bugger off. call me later.

57
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.668
So what's this big news?

58
00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:38.410
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

59
00:05:38.462 --> 00:05:40.286
and I'm the lobster.

60
00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:42.048
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.959
- In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

62
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.347
There was more than one lobster
present at the birth of Jesus?

63
00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.433
Duh.

64
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:58.263
Best sandwiches in Britain.

65
00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:01.766
Try my lovely nuts?

66
00:06:04.153 --> 00:06:06.855
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

67
00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:12.328
Morning. my future wife.

68
00:06:30.888 --> 00:06:32.880
OK. you can stop there. Thanks.

69
00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:35.340
I need a couple of orange gels.

70
00:06:35.392 --> 00:06:38.843
By the way. he introduced me as
John but everyone calls me Jack.

71
00:06:38.896 --> 00:06:41.982
Oh. fine. Nice to meet you. Jack.

72
00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:44.182
He got me right. though. I'm just Judy.

73
00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:46.768
Great. Just Judy!

74
00:06:51.783 --> 00:06:54.567
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

75
00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:58.154
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

76
00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:01.866
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

77
00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:05.452
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

78
00:07:05.505 --> 00:07:07.580
That is true.

79
00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:12.084
Good luck. kiddo.

80
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:38.068
Prime Minister. over here!

81
00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:51.497
Thank you.

82
00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:57.420
- Welcome. Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

83
00:07:57.473 --> 00:07:59.464
How are you?

84
00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:01.726
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

85
00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:03.978
Cool. Powerful.

86
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.721
Would you like to
meet your household staff?

87
00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:09.474
Yes. I would like that very much indeed.

88
00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:13.029
Anything to put off actually
running the country.

89
00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:17.241
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning. sir.

90
00:08:17.283 --> 00:08:19.984
Good morning. I had
an uncle called Terence.

91
00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:24.332
Hated him. I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

92
00:08:24.373 --> 00:08:26.532
- This is Pat.
- Hello. Pat.

93
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:29.117
Good morning. sir. I'm the housekeeper.

94
00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:31.787
Oh. right. I should be
easier than the last lot.

95
00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:34.707
No nappies. no teenagers. no scary wife.

96
00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:37.626
And this is Natalie.
She's new. like you.

97
00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:41.421
- Hello. Natalie.
- Hello. David. I mean. sir.

98
00:08:41.473 --> 00:08:43.799
Shit. I can't believe
I've just said that.

99
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:47.594
And now I've gone and said "shit".
Twice. I'm so sorry. sir.

100
00:08:47.646 --> 00:08:51.066
You could've said "fuck" and
we'd have been in real trouble.

101
00:08:51.108 --> 00:08:54.935
Thank you. sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

102
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.616
Oh. piss it!

103
00:08:59.658 --> 00:09:04.454
Right. I'll get my things and then
let's fix the country. shall we?

104
00:09:04.496 --> 00:09:06.403
Yeah. I can't see why not.

105
00:09:19.386 --> 00:09:22.055
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

106
00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:24.171
- Yes. I did.
- I just went "blurh".

107
00:09:24.223 --> 00:09:26.548
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

108
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:29.968
Yeah. I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

109
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.981
Ah.

110
00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:38.435
Oh. no.

111
00:09:38.487 --> 00:09:40.697
That is so inconvenient.

112
00:09:44.118 --> 00:09:45.578
In the presence of God. Peter
and Juliet have given their consent

113
00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:50.280
and made their
marriage vows to each other.

114
00:09:50.332 --> 00:09:53.449
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

115
00:09:53.502 --> 00:09:57.579
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

116
00:10:03.386 --> 00:10:06.389
And you resisted the
temptation for surprises.

117
00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:08.590
Yeah. I'm mature now.

118
00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:21.321
<i># Love. love. love</i>

119
00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:26.357
<i># Love. love. love</i>

120
00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:29.860
<i># - Love. love. love...

121
00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:32.947
Er. no.

122
00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:37.242
<i># Love. love. love. love</i>

123
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.247
<i># There's nothing you can

124
00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:44.375
Oh. it...

00:10:44.427 --> 00:10:47.211
<i># There's nothing you can
sing that can't be sung</i>

126

you can learn how to play the game</i>

Look. it's Pikey.

133
00:11:30.137 --> 00:11:33.005
Hello! What the hell
are you doing here?

134
00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:35.977
Oh. I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

135
00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:38.969
- The lady of the house let you in. did she?
- Yeah.

136
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:42.441
- Lovely. obliging girl.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:42.484 --> 00:11:45.820
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

138
00:11:45.862 --> 00:11:50.241
- Oh.
- Listen. erm. I've been thinking.

139
00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:54.746
I think we ought to take Mum out for her
birthday on Friday. What do you think?

140
00:11:54.787 --> 00:11:59.448
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

141
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.491
Hurry up. big boy!

142
00:12:01.543 --> 00:12:05.672
I'm naked and I want you at least
twice before Jamie gets home.

143
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:18.351
I am so happy to see you!

144
00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:22.512
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er. no. thanks.

145
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:30.352
Taste explosion?

146
00:12:42.417 --> 00:12:44.544
- Food?
- No. thanks.

147
00:12:44.586 --> 00:12:46.660
Yeah. a bit dodgy. isn't it?

148
00:12:46.712 --> 00:12:50.372
Looks like a dead baby's finger.

149
00:12:50.424 --> 00:12:52.874
Oh. Tastes like it. too.

150
00:12:56.514 --> 00:12:58.672
I'm Colin. by the way.

151
00:12:58.724 --> 00:13:01.258
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

152
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.760
- What do you do. Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

153
00:13:03.812 --> 00:13:05.772
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes. I do.

154
00:13:05.814 --> 00:13:09.683
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

155
00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:13.269
- God. I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

156
00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:15.563
Right.

157
00:13:18.117 --> 00:13:21.569
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

158
00:13:21.622 --> 00:13:24.113
English girls.
They're stuck up. you see.

159
00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:28.961
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler. game for a laugh.

160
00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:33.300
Like American girls. So I
should just go to America!

161
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:36.459
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

162
00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:38.794
I think it's crap. Colin.

163
00:13:38.846 --> 00:13:40.671
That's where you're wrong.

164
00:13:40.723 --> 00:13:43.758
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

165
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.970
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes. I do! I'm going to America.

166
00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:51.525
Colin. you're a lonely.
ugly arsehole. Accept it.

167
00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:56.562
Never. I am Colin. God of Sex. I'm just
on the wrong continent. that's all.

168
00:13:56.614 --> 00:13:59.450
Bit of quiet while we
finish the lighting. guys!

169
00:14:00.784 --> 00:14:04.204
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

170
00:14:04.246 --> 00:14:06.697
Judy. could you take
the top off this time?

171
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:10.992
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the. erm. nipples and when we're not.

172
00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:14.662
Yes. OK. Right. At least
it's nice and warm in here.

173
00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:16.174
Not always the case. is it?

174
00:14:16.216 --> 00:14:20.001
I was standing in for Brad Pitt
once on Seven Years In Tibet...

175
00:14:20.054 --> 00:14:22.295
- Yes. yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

176
00:14:22.347 --> 00:14:25.381
Guys. time's tight and we
have to get the actors in.

177
00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:27.592
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

178
00:14:30.355 --> 00:14:34.515
Right. let's have another
look at that. please.

179
00:14:45.495 --> 00:14:47.945
Can you just put your
hands on her breasts?

180
00:14:47.997 --> 00:14:50.322
- OK. yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

181
00:14:50.374 --> 00:14:52.199
I'll warm them up!

182
00:14:54.963 --> 00:14:57.882
- And massage them. please.
- Right.

183
00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:08.382
It's junction 13 that's just murder.
isn't it? Total gridlock this morning.

184
00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:17.348
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

185
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.810
Some of her requests.

186
00:15:19.862 --> 00:15:25.617
for instance. that I should bring Claudia
Schiffer as my date to the funeral.

187
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:29.527
I was confident she
expected me to ignore.

188
00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:32.749
But others she was
pretty damn clear about.

189
00:15:34.084 --> 00:15:37.337
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen.

190
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.038
I said. "Over my dead body".

191
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.261
And she said. "No. Daniel. over mine".

192
00:15:44.302 --> 00:15:47.472
And as usual. my darling girl...

193
00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:51.507
and Sam's darling mum was right.

194
00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:57.847
So she's going to say her final
farewell to you not through me but.

195
00:15:57.899 --> 00:15:59.974
inevitably.

196
00:16:01.235 --> 00:16:03.310
ever so coolly.

197
00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:07.982
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

198
00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:12.361
<i># Bye bye baby. baby goodbye</i>

199
00:16:12.413 --> 00:16:16.708
<i># Goodbye baby. baby bye bye</i>

200
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.628
<i># Bye bye baby</i>

201
00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:23.830
<i># Don't make me cry
Goodbye baby. baby bye bye</i>

202
00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:27.834
<i># You're the one girl in town I'd marry</i>

203
00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:33.225
<i># Girl I'd marry you now if I were free</i>

204
00:16:33.267 --> 00:16:38.386
<i># I wish it could be</i>

205
00:16:38.438 --> 00:16:42.390
<i># I could love you but why begin it?</i>

206
00:16:42.442 --> 00:16:45.529
<i># Cos there ain't any future in it</i>

207
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.157
<i># She's got me but I'm not free so...</i>

208
00:16:50.158 --> 00:16:52.941

00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:57.707

00:17:04.713 --> 00:17:06.539
<i># Wish I never had known you...</i>

213
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:09.166
Do you love him?

214
00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:11.293
Er. er. what?

215
00:17:11.345 --> 00:17:15.130
No. I-I just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

216
00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:20.094
and you needed someone to talk to about
it and no one had ever asked you.

217
00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:24.973
No. No. No is the answer.
Absolutely not.

218
00:17:25.025 --> 00:17:27.016
<i># on my finger...</i>

219
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.976
So that's a no. then?

220
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:31.188
Yes. Erm...

221
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.732
<i># Bye bye baby. baby goodbye</i>

222
00:17:33.784 --> 00:17:35.859
<i># Goodbye baby. baby bye bye...</i>

223
00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:38.830
This DJ. what do you reckon?

224
00:17:38.872 --> 00:17:41.791
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

225
00:17:41.833 --> 00:17:44.284
I think it all hangs on the next song.

226
00:17:44.336 --> 00:17:46.379
Now here's one for the lovers.

227
00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:50.466
That's quite a few of you. I shouldn't
be surprised and a half.

228
00:17:54.221 --> 00:17:56.546
<i># And they called it...</i>

229
00:17:56.598 --> 00:18:01.759
- He's done it. it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

230
00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:05.971
<i># Oh. I guess they'll never know...</i>

231
00:18:09.318 --> 00:18:11.195
Sarah's waiting for you.

232
00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.813
Oh. yes. of course. erm...

233
00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:17.857
Great. er. good. good.

234
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:22.123
How are you doing. Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

235
00:18:22.164 --> 00:18:23.905
Absolutely.

236
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.034
- Harry?
- Sarah.

237
00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:35.219
switch off your phone and tell me exactly how
long it is that you've been working here.

238
00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:40.922
Two years. seven months.

239
00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:43.675
three days and. I suppose.
what. two hours?

240
00:18:43.727 --> 00:18:48.763
And how long have you been in love with
Karl. our enigmatic chief designer?

241
00:18:49.816 --> 00:18:51.891
Um...

242
00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:59.815
Two years. seven months. three days and.
I suppose. an hour and 30 minutes.

243
00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:01.577
Thought as much.

244
00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:03.694
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

245
00:19:03.746 --> 00:19:06.029
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

246
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:10.128
Oh. that is... that is bad news.

247
00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:15.622
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

248
00:19:16.675 --> 00:19:19.168
- Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink

249
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.099
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

250
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:26.508
- You know that?
- Yes.

251
00:19:27.728 --> 00:19:30.011
And so does Karl.

252
00:19:30.064 --> 00:19:32.556
Think about it. for all our sakes.

253
00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:35.183
It's Christmas.

254
00:19:36.612 --> 00:19:40.146
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

255
00:19:40.198 --> 00:19:42.409
Thanks. boss.

256
00:19:43.994 --> 00:19:46.277
- Hi. Sarah.
- Hi. Karl.

257
00:19:56.923 --> 00:20:00.176
Babe. Absolutely. fire away.

258
00:20:01.302 --> 00:20:03.513
Mia. Mia. would you turn that down?

259
00:20:05.598 --> 00:20:07.340
What is that?

260
00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:11.010
That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

261
00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:14.012
Oh. dear me. how are the mighty fallen.

262
00:20:14.065 --> 00:20:19.737
I can safely say that is the worst
record I've heard this century...

263
00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:23.939
Oh. and coincidentally. I believe
Billy will be a guest

264
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:26.744
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

265
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:29.987
Welcome back. Bill.

266
00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:32.114
Billy. welcome back to the airwaves.

267
00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:35.367
New Christmas single.
cover of Love Is All Around.

268
00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:40.757
Except we've changed the word
"love" to "Christmas".

269
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:44.000
Yes. is that an important
message to you. Bill?

270
00:20:44.053 --> 00:20:46.544
Not really. Mike.

271
00:20:46.597 --> 00:20:50.923
Christmas is a time for people with
someone they love in their lives.

272
00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:53.467
- And that's not you?
- That's not me. Michael.

273
00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:57.514
When I was young and successful.
I was greedy and foolish

274
00:20:57.566 --> 00:21:01.726
and now I'm left with
no one. wrinkled and alone.

275
00:21:01.778 --> 00:21:04.530
- Wow. Thanks for that. Bill.
- For what?

276
00:21:04.572 --> 00:21:07.440
For actually giving a
real answer to a question.

277
00:21:07.492 --> 00:21:11.235
It doesn't often happen here at
Radio Watford. I can tell you.

278
00:21:11.287 --> 00:21:15.072
- Ask me anything. I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

279
00:21:15.124 --> 00:21:17.876
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

280
00:21:17.918 --> 00:21:20.202
No. only kidding!

281
00:21:20.255 --> 00:21:22.663
- She was rubbish.
- OK. here's one.

282
00:21:22.715 --> 00:21:27.344
How do you think the new record
compares to your old. classic stuff?

283
00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:30.921
Come on. Mikey. you know as
well as I do the record's crap.

284
00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:36.176
But wouldn't it be great if
number one this Christmas

285
00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.553
wasn't some smug teenager

286
00:21:38.605 --> 00:21:42.933
but an old ex-heroin addict searching
for a comeback at any price?

287
00:21:42.985 --> 00:21:46.520
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

288
00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:49.272
with a cute bird
balancing on their balls

289
00:21:49.324 --> 00:21:52.942
and I'll be stuck in some dingy
flat with me manager Joe.

290
00:21:52.994 --> 00:21:55.122
ugliest man in the world.

291
00:21:55.164 --> 00:21:59.626
fucking miserable because our
fucking gamble didn't pay off.

292
00:21:59.668 --> 00:22:04.954
So if you believe in Father Christmas.
children. like your Uncle Billy does.

293
00:22:05.006 --> 00:22:08.791
buy my festering turd of a record.

294
00:22:08.843 --> 00:22:11.877
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

295
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.392
of the moment we try to squeeze an
extra syllable into the fourth line.

296
00:22:16.434 --> 00:22:18.718
I think you're referring to

297
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.095
"If you really love Christmas..."

298
00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:24.400
"Come on and let it snow". Ouch.

299
00:22:24.442 --> 00:22:26.516
So. here it is one more time.

300
00:22:26.569 --> 00:22:29.906
the dark horse for this
year's Christmas number one.

301
00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:34.441
Christmas Is All Around. Thank you.
Billy. After this. the news.

302
00:22:34.493 --> 00:22:37.027
Is the new prime minister
in trouble already?

303
00:22:38.163 --> 00:22:42.210
<i># I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes</i>

304
00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:45.838
- OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

305
00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:50.008
Ah. yes. yes. I fear this is going
to be a difficult one to play. Alex.

306
00:22:51.092 --> 00:22:55.420
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

307
00:22:55.472 --> 00:22:58.006
- like the last government.
- Here. here.

308
00:22:58.058 --> 00:23:02.187
This is our first really important
test. let's take a stand.

309
00:23:02.228 --> 00:23:06.942
Right. Right. I understand
that but I have decided...

310
00:23:08.485 --> 00:23:10.560
not to. Not this time.

311
00:23:10.612 --> 00:23:15.158
Let's not forget that America is the
most powerful country in the world.

312
00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:17.733
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

313
00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:23.572
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

314
00:23:30.548 --> 00:23:32.342
Right.

315
00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:36.335
Yeah. come in.

316
00:23:40.557 --> 00:23:43.227
These are from the Treasury...

317
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:46.386
and these are for you.

318
00:23:46.438 --> 00:23:48.232
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

319
00:23:48.273 --> 00:23:52.485
I was hoping you'd win. not that I
wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke.

320
00:23:52.527 --> 00:23:56.438
just always given him the boring
biscuits with no chocolate.

321
00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.398
Thanks very much. Thanks...

322
00:24:00.035 --> 00:24:02.193
Natalie.

323
00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:11.494
God. come on. get a grip. You're the
Prime Minister. for God's sake.

324
00:24:13.548 --> 00:24:16.081
So what do you reckon to
our new prime minister?

325
00:24:16.134 --> 00:24:20.712
Oh. I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married. though.

326
00:24:20.764 --> 00:24:23.933
You know the type.
he's married to his job.

327
00:24:23.975 --> 00:24:27.228
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

328
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:30.555
Excuse me. Judy. if you
could just lower the nipples

329
00:24:30.607 --> 00:24:33.099
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

330
00:24:36.362 --> 00:24:38.979
I have to say. Judy.
this is a real pleasure.

331
00:24:39.031 --> 00:24:42.733
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

332
00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:44.860
- Thank you!
- Oh. well. you know.

333
00:24:44.912 --> 00:24:46.653
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

334
00:24:46.705 --> 00:24:49.072
The move again. please. Judy.

335
00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:51.658
- Sorry.
- Oh. God. sorry. You all right?

336
00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:57.841
- Exciting news!
- What?

337
00:24:57.883 --> 00:25:01.219
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

338
00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:02.721
- No.
- Yes!

339
00:25:02.762 --> 00:25:06.923
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

340
00:25:06.975 --> 00:25:10.635
Yes! Wisconsin
babes. here comes Sir Colin!

341
00:25:10.687 --> 00:25:14.899
No. Col! There are a few babes
in America. I grant you.

342
00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:17.726
but they're going out with
rich. attractive guys.

343
00:25:17.778 --> 00:25:21.031
Tone. you're just jealous.

344
00:25:21.072 --> 00:25:24.982
You know perfectly well that
any bar anywhere in America

345
00:25:25.034 --> 00:25:29.444
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

346
00:25:29.497 --> 00:25:34.158
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

347
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:39.162
No. I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince
William without the weird family.

348
00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:41.498
- No. Colin. no!
- Yes!

349
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.750
- Nyet!
- Da!

350
00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:44.178
- Nein!
- Ja. darling!

351
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.963
Right. the Christmas party.
not my favourite night of the year

352
00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:50.382
and your unhappy job to organise.

353
00:25:50.434 --> 00:25:53.437
- Tell me.
- It's basic. really.

354
00:25:53.478 --> 00:25:57.306
Find a venue. over-order on
the drinks. bulk buy the guacamole

355
00:25:57.358 --> 00:26:01.403
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

356
00:26:01.445 --> 00:26:05.939
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean. not children.

357
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.609
But their wives and
girlfriends. et cetera.

358
00:26:09.661 --> 00:26:15.416
Oh. Christ. you haven't got some horrible
six-foot. tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

359
00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:20.255
No. I'll just be hanging around the
mistletoe. hoping to be kissed.

360
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.342
Really?

361
00:26:24.384 --> 00:26:26.459
Right.

362
00:26:35.812 --> 00:26:39.680
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean. he'll be up there now.

363
00:26:39.732 --> 00:26:43.434
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

364
00:26:43.486 --> 00:26:48.032
Bernard. Stays in his room
all the time. Thank goodness.

365
00:26:48.074 --> 00:26:50.909
Yeah. but Karen. this is all the time.

366
00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:56.530
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong. you know?

367
00:26:56.582 --> 00:26:58.657
I mean. clearly it's about his mum

368
00:26:58.709 --> 00:27:03.870
but Christ. he might be injecting
heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.

369
00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:05.716
At the age of 11?

370
00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:10.001
Well. maybe not his
eyeballs. then. Maybe just his veins.

371
00:27:10.053 --> 00:27:14.432
The problem is his mum always used
to talk to him. you know. and...

372
00:27:16.142 --> 00:27:21.481
I don't know. this whole stepfather
thing seems suddenly to somehow matter

373
00:27:21.523 --> 00:27:23.806
like it never did before.

374
00:27:23.858 --> 00:27:28.686
Listen. it was always going
to be a totally shit time.

375
00:27:28.738 --> 00:27:31.314
Just be patient.

376
00:27:31.366 --> 00:27:33.733
And maybe check the room for needles.

377
00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:38.779
And then when he sometimes does
come out. it's obvious he's been crying.

378
00:27:47.965 --> 00:27:51.500
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

379
00:27:51.552 --> 00:27:54.806
And now if it's going to
ruin Sam's life as well...

380
00:27:56.098 --> 00:27:58.966
I just don't know.

381
00:27:59.018 --> 00:28:01.718
Get a grip.

382
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.980
People hate sissies.

383
00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:07.307
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

384
00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:10.310
Yeah. Absolutely.

385
00:28:10.362 --> 00:28:12.437
Helpful.

386
00:28:20.122 --> 00:28:23.990
So. what's the problem. Samuel?

387
00:28:25.877 --> 00:28:30.705
Is it just Mum or is
it something else. huh?

388
00:28:32.092 --> 00:28:34.250
Maybe school?

389
00:28:35.428 --> 00:28:37.388
Are you being bullied?

390
00:28:38.473 --> 00:28:40.683
Or is it something worse?

391
00:28:42.477 --> 00:28:44.802
Can you give me any clues at all?

392
00:28:46.356 --> 00:28:49.608
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

393
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.225
Even though you won't be able to help?

394
00:28:52.277 --> 00:28:54.895
Even if that's the case. yeah.

395
00:28:56.908 --> 00:28:59.358
OK. Well...

396
00:29:00.536 --> 00:29:03.320
truth is. actually...

397
00:29:04.373 --> 00:29:06.282
I'm in love.

398
00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:07.960
Sorry?

399
00:29:08.002 --> 00:29:12.579
I know I should be thinking about
Mum and I am but I'm in love.

400
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:16.926
I was before she died and there's
nothing I can do about it.

401
00:29:16.968 --> 00:29:21.046
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

402
00:29:21.098 --> 00:29:24.132
Ah. well. OK. well...

403
00:29:25.977 --> 00:29:28.511
I'm a little relieved.

404
00:29:29.606 --> 00:29:31.765
- Why?
- Because I...

405
00:29:31.817 --> 00:29:33.975
thought it'd be something worse.

406
00:29:34.027 --> 00:29:37.061
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

407
00:29:37.113 --> 00:29:39.782
Er...

408
00:29:39.824 --> 00:29:42.525
No. you're right.

409
00:29:42.577 --> 00:29:44.735
Total agony.

410
00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:23.992
- Night. Sarah.
- Night. Karl.

411
00:30:33.877 --> 00:30:35.952
Yeah. absolutely.

412
00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:39.288
Free as a bird. Fire away.

413
00:31:10.788 --> 00:31:12.946
Alone again.

414
00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:15.917
Naturally.

415
00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:18.118
I'll deal with it.

416
00:31:19.213 --> 00:31:22.800
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

417
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.386
Thanks.

418
00:31:26.428 --> 00:31:28.503
Natalie.

419
00:31:30.808 --> 00:31:33.560
Erm. I'm starting to feel...

420
00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:38.471
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

421
00:31:38.523 --> 00:31:43.101
and me knowing so little about
you. it seems elitist and wrong.

422
00:31:44.196 --> 00:31:46.020
Well. there's not much to know.

423
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:49.607
Well. erm. where do you
live. for instance?

424
00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:51.869
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

425
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:55.279
- Ah. my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

426
00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:59.116
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

427
00:31:59.168 --> 00:32:02.786
At the end of the high street.
Harris Street. near the Queen's Head.

428
00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:05.706
Oh. yeah. yeah. that is dodgy.

429
00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:10.054
Erm. and you live with
your husband? Boyfriend?

430
00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:14.308
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

431
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:19.011
I've just split up with my boyfriend. so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

432
00:32:19.063 --> 00:32:23.390
- Ah. Sorry.
- No. it's fine.

433
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:25.892
I'm well shot of him.

434
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.780
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

435
00:32:28.822 --> 00:32:32.774
He said no one'd fancy a girl with
thighs the size of tree trunks.

436
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:35.443
Not a nice guy. actually. in the end.

437
00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.863
No.

438
00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:48.091
You know. erm...

439
00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:52.053
being Prime Minister. I could
just have him murdered.

440
00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:55.630
Thank you. sir. I'll think about it.

441
00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:59.633
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

442
00:32:59.685 --> 00:33:03.679
Ruthless. trained killers
are just a phone call away.

443
00:33:09.362 --> 00:33:11.437
Oh. God.

444
00:33:14.074 --> 00:33:16.441
Did you have this kind of problem?

445
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:21.488
Yeah. course you did. you saucy minx.

446
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.991
So. let's go. We can
definitely crack this.

447
00:33:25.043 --> 00:33:27.285
Remember. I was a kid once. too.

448
00:33:27.337 --> 00:33:31.748
So. come on. it's someone
at school. Right?

449
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.708
- Yeah. -
Uh-huh. Good. good.

450
00:33:33.761 --> 00:33:36.878
And what does she. he. feel about you?

451
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.881
She doesn't even know my name.

452
00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:42.770
And even if she did. she'd despise me.

453
00:33:42.811 --> 00:33:45.178
She's the coolest girl in school.

454
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.359
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

455
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.934
Good. Good.

456
00:33:53.195 --> 00:33:55.355
Well.

457
00:33:55.407 --> 00:33:58.107
basically you're fucked. aren't you?

458
00:34:04.331 --> 00:34:06.824
Hi there and welcome back.

459
00:34:06.876 --> 00:34:11.203
So. three weeks till Christmas. looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

460
00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:15.801
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

461
00:34:15.843 --> 00:34:18.252
No. Little scamps.

462
00:34:18.304 --> 00:34:21.755
But very. very talented musicians.

463
00:34:21.807 --> 00:34:26.103
Yeah. I understand you've got a
prize for our competition winners.

464
00:34:26.145 --> 00:34:27.635
Yes. I have. Ant or Dec.

465
00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:31.734
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

466
00:34:31.776 --> 00:34:33.433
Oh. great.

467
00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:37.270
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass.

468
00:34:37.322 --> 00:34:42.119
so if you've got a framed picture.
like. for instance. this one of Blue.

469
00:34:42.161 --> 00:34:44.236
you can just write on it.

470
00:34:57.968 --> 00:35:01.877
Er. a lot of kids watching.
Billy. Oh. yeah.

471
00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:04.797
Hiya. kids.

472
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:08.269
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

473
00:35:08.311 --> 00:35:10.469
don't buy drugs.

474
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.526
Become a pop star and they
give you them for free.

475
00:35:15.568 --> 00:35:20.396
And I do believe it's a commercial
break. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

476
00:35:20.448 --> 00:35:25.275
<i># All I want for Christmas is you</i>

477
00:35:32.501 --> 00:35:36.661
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

478
00:35:36.713 --> 00:35:39.289
Actually. they're
not funny. They're art.

479
00:35:43.804 --> 00:35:46.556
OK. let's say. er. Thursday. my place.

480
00:35:46.598 --> 00:35:50.977
Great. I've got Juliet on the other
line. she wants to ask you a favour.

481
00:35:51.019 --> 00:35:56.014
- OK. fine.
- Thanks and. er. be nice.

482
00:35:56.066 --> 00:36:01.185
- I'm always nice.
- You know what I mean. Marky. be friendly.

483
00:36:01.237 --> 00:36:03.604
- I'm always...
- Mark?

484
00:36:03.656 --> 00:36:06.608
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

485
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.443
It was great. Thanks for
the gorgeous sendoff.

486
00:36:09.496 --> 00:36:13.113
- So. what can I do for you?
- It's only a tiny favour.

487
00:36:13.165 --> 00:36:16.168
I've just tried the wedding
video and it's a disaster.

488
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.297
- It's come out all blue and wibbly.
- I'm sorry.

489
00:36:19.339 --> 00:36:23.040
I remember you filming a lot and
I wondered if I could look at it.

490
00:36:23.092 --> 00:36:25.219
To be honest. I didn't really...

491
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:29.974
Please. All I want is one shot of me in
a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

492
00:36:30.016 --> 00:36:34.968
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure
I wiped it. so don't get any hopes up.

493
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.887
<i>Must go.</i>

494
00:36:42.528 --> 00:36:45.364
Any progress with our
matchmaking plans?

495
00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:49.357
No. I've done fuck-all and never
will because he's too good for me.

496
00:36:49.409 --> 00:36:51.484
How true.

497
00:36:52.912 --> 00:36:54.988
Stop.

498
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.282
And of course. your mobile goes.

499
00:36:58.293 --> 00:37:00.962
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

500
00:37:02.046 --> 00:37:04.966
- So. how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

501
00:37:05.007 --> 00:37:07.219
Think I've found a venue.

502
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.680
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

503
00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:15.841
It's an art gallery. Full of dark
corners for doing dark deeds.

504
00:37:17.687 --> 00:37:21.055
Oh. Right.

505
00:37:21.107 --> 00:37:25.319
Good. Well. I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

506
00:37:25.361 --> 00:37:27.488
You should.

507
00:37:46.548 --> 00:37:48.123
Ah. bonjour. Eleonore.

508
00:37:48.175 --> 00:37:51.042
Bonjour. Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

509
00:37:51.094 --> 00:37:53.222
And this year you bring a lady guest?

510
00:37:53.264 --> 00:37:56.517
No. There's a change
of situation. Just me.

511
00:37:56.558 --> 00:38:01.021
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

512
00:38:01.062 --> 00:38:03.815
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah. yeah.

513
00:38:03.856 --> 00:38:09.102
Good. Well. I find you a perfect
lady to clean the house.

514
00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:11.729
This is Aurelia.

515
00:38:11.781 --> 00:38:13.741
Ah.

516
00:38:13.783 --> 00:38:17.860
- Er. bonjour. Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

517
00:38:17.913 --> 00:38:23.073
Er. je suis. er. tres heureux
de vous avoir ici.

518
00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:28.213
Unfortunately. she cannot
speak French. just like you.

519
00:38:28.255 --> 00:38:30.216
She's Portuguese.

520
00:38:30.258 --> 00:38:32.875
Ah. ah. buongiorno.

521
00:38:32.927 --> 00:38:34.887
Eusebio. er. er...

522
00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:37.337
Er. molto bueno...

523
00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:43.635
I think she's ten years too young to
remember a footballer called Eusebio.

524
00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:46.096
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

525
00:38:46.148 --> 00:38:47.691
Right.

526
00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:50.517
Anyway. it's nice to meet you and...

527
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:53.312
Can you drive her home after her work?

528
00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:57.190
Oh. absolutely. yes.
Con-Con grande. er. pl-plesura.

529
00:38:57.242 --> 00:38:59.484
Which is what? Turkish?

530
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.285
Bello.

531
00:39:10.922 --> 00:39:12.997
Er. bella.

532
00:39:14.175 --> 00:39:16.542
Er. mon-montagno.

533
00:39:16.594 --> 00:39:18.670
arvarez...

534
00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:24.175
No. right. Silence is golden.

535
00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:28.439
As the Tremeloes said.

536
00:39:30.275 --> 00:39:31.985
Clever guys.

537
00:39:32.026 --> 00:39:37.312
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

538
00:39:37.364 --> 00:39:39.356
Gr-great band.

539
00:39:41.994 --> 00:39:44.403
Oh. shut up.

540
00:39:55.216 --> 00:39:57.426
Mr President!

541
00:39:59.177 --> 00:40:01.930
- Over here. sir!
- What will you be talking about?

542
00:40:03.348 --> 00:40:05.059
Mr President. welcome.

543
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.727
It's a pleasure to meet you.

544
00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:09.604
Come through. I'm sorry
your wife couldn't make it.

545
00:40:09.646 --> 00:40:12.930
So is she. Although she would
have been kind of lonely.

546
00:40:12.982 --> 00:40:15.057
Yes. Pathetic. isn't it?

547
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:17.602
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

548
00:40:17.654 --> 00:40:20.323
Not sure that politics
and dating go together.

549
00:40:20.365 --> 00:40:23.368
Really? I've never found that.

550
00:40:23.409 --> 00:40:27.872
Yeah. you're still sickeningly handsome.
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

551
00:40:27.913 --> 00:40:32.627
- Very jealous of your plane. by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

552
00:40:32.669 --> 00:40:34.952
Ah. Natalie. Hi.

553
00:40:35.004 --> 00:40:37.756
Morning. ma'am. How's your day so far?

554
00:40:37.798 --> 00:40:40.499
Excellent.

555
00:40:43.137 --> 00:40:46.922
My goodness. that's a pretty
little son of a bitch.

556
00:40:46.974 --> 00:40:49.049
Did you see those pipes?

557
00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:52.302
Yeah. she's terrific. At her job.

558
00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:57.067
No. absolutely not. We cannot and
will not consult on that either.

559
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:59.017
That is unexpected.

560
00:40:59.069 --> 00:41:01.561
Well. it shouldn't be.

561
00:41:01.613 --> 00:41:04.814
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

562
00:41:04.867 --> 00:41:07.734
We're being consistent
with their policies.

563
00:41:07.786 --> 00:41:10.653
With all respect.
they were bad policies.

564
00:41:10.706 --> 00:41:13.958
Thanks. Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

565
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.911
Let's. erm... move on. shall we?

566
00:41:20.423 --> 00:41:23.843
Well. now. that was an interesting day.

567
00:41:25.428 --> 00:41:29.474
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today.

568
00:41:29.516 --> 00:41:32.300
then just disappointing
you for four years.

569
00:41:32.352 --> 00:41:35.302
I have plans and I plan
to see them through.

570
00:41:35.354 --> 00:41:38.441
Absolutely. There is one
final thing to look at.

571
00:41:38.482 --> 00:41:41.736
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

572
00:41:41.778 --> 00:41:44.395
I'll give you anything you ask for.

573
00:41:44.447 --> 00:41:47.564
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

574
00:41:52.287 --> 00:41:53.998
Hi.

575
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.115
Pathetic.

576
00:42:16.812 --> 00:42:20.315
It's great Scotch.

577
00:42:20.357 --> 00:42:24.308
I'll. erm... I'll be going. then.

578
00:42:25.778 --> 00:42:28.103
Er. Natalie.

579
00:42:28.155 --> 00:42:33.109
I hope to see much more of you as our
countries work toward a better future.

580
00:42:33.161 --> 00:42:35.653
Thank you. sir.

581
00:42:51.929 --> 00:42:53.890
Er. yes. Peter.

582
00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:56.215
Mr President. has it been a good visit?

583
00:42:56.267 --> 00:42:59.853
Very satisfactory indeed.

584
00:42:59.895 --> 00:43:02.564
We got what we came for

585
00:43:02.606 --> 00:43:06.141
and our special relationship
is still very special.

586
00:43:06.193 --> 00:43:08.727
Prime Minister?

587
00:43:08.779 --> 00:43:13.325
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins. doesn't it?

588
00:43:13.366 --> 00:43:16.902
I fear that this has
become a bad relationship.

589
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.209
A relationship based on the
President taking what he wants

590
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:27.286
and casually ignoring all those
things that really matter to. erm...

591
00:43:29.925 --> 00:43:32.000
Britain.

592
00:43:32.052 --> 00:43:36.212
We may be a small country
but we're a great one. too.

593
00:43:36.264 --> 00:43:39.517
The country of Shakespeare.
Churchill. the Beatles.

594
00:43:39.558 --> 00:43:42.812
Sean Connery. Harry Potter.

595
00:43:42.854 --> 00:43:45.857
David Beckham's right foot.

596
00:43:45.898 --> 00:43:48.599
David Beckham's left foot. come to that.

597
00:43:48.651 --> 00:43:52.697
And a friend who bullies
us is no longer a friend.

598
00:43:52.739 --> 00:43:55.992
And since bullies only respond
to strength. from now onward.

599
00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:59.776
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

600
00:43:59.828 --> 00:44:03.113
And the President should
be prepared for that.

601
00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:15.041
Mr President!

602
00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:20.422
Joe.

603
00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:23.716
It's your sister on line four.

604
00:44:25.061 --> 00:44:29.639
All right. Er. yes. I'm very busy
and important. how can I help you?

605
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:31.850
Have you gone completely insane?

606
00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:35.645
- You can't always be sensible.
- You can if you're Prime Minister.

607
00:44:35.697 --> 00:44:38.480
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

608
00:44:38.533 --> 00:44:41.317
- I'll call you back.
- No. you won't!

609
00:44:43.204 --> 00:44:49.126
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

610
00:44:49.168 --> 00:44:52.285
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

611
00:44:52.338 --> 00:44:56.916
What did I do? I made a
papier-m�ch� lobster head.

612
00:44:56.968 --> 00:44:59.543
What is this we're listening to?

613
00:44:59.595 --> 00:45:01.878
Joni Mitchell.

614
00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.799
I can't believe you still
listen to Joni Mitchell.

615
00:45:04.851 --> 00:45:08.437
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

616
00:45:09.855 --> 00:45:14.933
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

617
00:45:14.985 --> 00:45:19.198
Did she? Oh. well. that's good.
I must write to her and say thanks.

618
00:45:20.574 --> 00:45:22.857
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

619
00:45:22.909 --> 00:45:27.122
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

620
00:45:28.373 --> 00:45:31.825
It's almost enough to
make you feel patriotic.

621
00:45:31.877 --> 00:45:35.536
so here's one for our
arse-kicking prime minister.

622
00:45:35.588 --> 00:45:38.289
A golden oldie for a golden oldie.

623
00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:40.750
<i># Hold me</i>

624
00:45:40.802 --> 00:45:43.555
<i># I'll give you all that you need</i>

625
00:45:44.639 --> 00:45:47.725
<i># Wrap your love around me</i>

626
00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:51.468
<i># You're so excited I can
feel you getting hotter</i>

627
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.231
<i># Oh baby</i>

628
00:45:53.273 --> 00:45:57.902
<i># I'll take you down. I'll take you down</i>

629
00:45:57.944 --> 00:46:00.310
<i># Where no one's ever gone before</i>

630
00:46:00.362 --> 00:46:02.239
<i># And if you want more</i>

631
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:07.109
<i># If you want more. more. more</i>

632
00:46:07.161 --> 00:46:09.945
<i># Jump for my love</i>

633
00:46:09.997 --> 00:46:11.905
<i># Jump in</i>

634
00:46:11.957 --> 00:46:13.750
<i># And feel my touch</i>

635
00:46:13.792 --> 00:46:17.953
<i># Jump. if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then</i>

636
00:46:18.005 --> 00:46:20.674
<i># Jump for my love</i>

637
00:46:21.884 --> 00:46:26.346
<i># I'll take you down. I'll take you down</i>

638
00:46:26.388 --> 00:46:27.879
<i># Where no one's ever gone</i>

639
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:29.840
Yeah. erm.

640
00:46:29.892 --> 00:46:35.053
Mary. can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

641
00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:38.639
- Certainly. sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

642
00:46:46.032 --> 00:46:48.785
Erm. Would you like the last. er?

643
00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:51.151
Thank you very much but no.

644
00:46:51.203 --> 00:46:53.363
If you saw my sister.
you'd understand why.

645
00:46:53.415 --> 00:46:55.542
That's all right. more for me.

646
00:46:55.583 --> 00:46:57.794
Just don't go eating it all yourself.

647
00:46:57.835 --> 00:46:59.378
you're getting chubbier every day.

648
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.914
I'm very lucky I've got a constitution
where I never put on weight.

649
00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:09.795
Hello.

650
00:47:16.604 --> 00:47:19.096
Oop. Sorry.

651
00:47:22.568 --> 00:47:24.194
Hello?

652
00:47:40.126 --> 00:47:42.702
- Thank you.
- Nao!

653
00:47:42.754 --> 00:47:45.955
- Eu pe�o imensa desculpa.
- Oh. no. Hold on.

654
00:47:46.007 --> 00:47:48.582
- God. it's half the book. Oh. no.
- Que desastre.

655
00:47:48.635 --> 00:47:52.169
Just leave them.
please! They're not important.

656
00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:54.922
They're not worth it!

657
00:47:54.975 --> 00:47:57.925
Stop! Stop.

658
00:48:01.772 --> 00:48:03.983
It's all just rubbish.

659
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.768
Just leave it.

660
00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:22.918
Oh. God. she's in.

661
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.786
And now she'll think I'm a total
spaz if I don't go in too.

662
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:30.290
Fuck
- it's cold!

663
00:48:33.804 --> 00:48:36.171
Fuck
- it's freezing! Fuck!

664
00:48:36.223 --> 00:48:39.559
This stuff better be good.

665
00:48:40.143 --> 00:48:43.094
It's not worth it. this
isn't bloody Shakespeare.

666
00:48:43.146 --> 00:48:45.023
I don't want to drown

667
00:48:45.065 --> 00:48:47.849
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

668
00:48:47.901 --> 00:48:49.360
Just stop. Stop.

669
00:48:49.402 --> 00:48:52.155
What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?

670
00:48:52.238 --> 00:48:54.116
I really must do copies.

671
00:48:55.492 --> 00:48:57.702
There'd better not be eels in here.

672
00:48:57.744 --> 00:49:00.861
Try not to disturb the eels.

673
00:49:00.913 --> 00:49:02.905
Oh. what the hell is that?

674
00:49:13.134 --> 00:49:15.459
Thank you. Thank you so much.

675
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:23.383
I know. I'll name one of
the characters after you.

676
00:49:23.435 --> 00:49:27.981
Maybe you could name one
of the characters after me.

677
00:49:37.449 --> 00:49:40.233
What kind of book is it?

678
00:49:49.044 --> 00:49:51.170
- Romance?
- Yes.

679
00:49:51.212 --> 00:49:54.216
It's. erm...

680
00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:55.498
Ah. er...

681
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:57.792
Thriller... crime...

682
00:49:57.844 --> 00:50:01.837
Sim. Crime. Crime. murder.

683
00:50:01.889 --> 00:50:03.630
Frightening?

684
00:50:03.683 --> 00:50:06.801
Er. scary? Yes. sometimes scary.

685
00:50:06.853 --> 00:50:11.315
And. er. sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

686
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:28.697
I'd better get back to work.

687
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:32.534
- Ah.
- Later you'll drive me home?

688
00:50:32.586 --> 00:50:34.661
Sure.

689
00:50:37.966 --> 00:50:40.970
It's my favourite time of day...

690
00:50:41.011 --> 00:50:43.086
driving you.

691
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:49.894
It's the saddest part
of my day. leaving you.

692
00:50:55.734 --> 00:50:57.277
Sorry.

693
00:51:24.678 --> 00:51:28.181
<i>And coming up later
this morning. it's this guy...</i>

694
00:51:28.223 --> 00:51:32.634
<i># There's no beginning. there'll be no end</i>

695
00:51:32.686 --> 00:51:36.471
<i># Cos on Christmas...
- the bad grandad of rock'n'roll.</i>

696
00:51:36.523 --> 00:51:39.140
<i>here at 10:30. Do not switch off.</i>

697
00:51:45.074 --> 00:51:46.981
Banoffee pie?

698
00:51:47.034 --> 00:51:48.827
No. thanks.

699
00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:52.373
Thank God. You would've broken
my heart if you'd said yes.

700
00:51:52.414 --> 00:51:55.918
Right. well. lucky you.

701
00:51:55.959 --> 00:51:59.869
- Can I come in?
- Er. yeah. well. I'm a bit busy...

702
00:51:59.921 --> 00:52:04.833
I was just passing and I thought we
might check that video thing out.

703
00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:07.835
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

704
00:52:07.888 --> 00:52:10.171
or maybe Munchies?

705
00:52:10.223 --> 00:52:14.633
Actually. I was serious. I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

706
00:52:14.685 --> 00:52:17.637
Mark. can I say something?

707
00:52:17.689 --> 00:52:19.764
Yeah.

708
00:52:20.817 --> 00:52:23.350
I know you're Peter's best friend

709
00:52:23.402 --> 00:52:28.564
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

710
00:52:28.616 --> 00:52:31.536
Look. don't. don't argue.

711
00:52:31.577 --> 00:52:33.986
We've never got friendly.

712
00:52:34.038 --> 00:52:36.571
But I wanted to say.
I hope that can change.

713
00:52:36.623 --> 00:52:40.701
I'm nice. I really am. Apart from
my terrible taste in pie and...

714
00:52:42.046 --> 00:52:44.663
It would be great if
we could be friends.

715
00:52:45.299 --> 00:52:47.374
Absolutely. Absolutely.

716
00:52:50.971 --> 00:52:53.380
Great.

717
00:52:53.432 --> 00:52:56.435
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video. though.

718
00:52:56.476 --> 00:53:00.344
I had a real search when you first
called and couldn't find it so...

719
00:53:00.397 --> 00:53:03.347
This one says "Peter
and Juliet's Wedding".

720
00:53:03.399 --> 00:53:05.725
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

721
00:53:05.777 --> 00:53:10.354
Er. yeah. well... Wow.
That-that could be it.

722
00:53:10.407 --> 00:53:13.159
- Do you mind if I?
- I've probably taped over it.

723
00:53:13.201 --> 00:53:16.319
Almost everything's
episodes of West Wing.

724
00:53:17.414 --> 00:53:19.489
Oh.

725
00:53:21.084 --> 00:53:23.211
Oh. bingo.

726
00:53:24.837 --> 00:53:26.964
That's lovely.

727
00:53:27.006 --> 00:53:29.165
Well done. you.

728
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.751
Oh. that's gorgeous.

729
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.308
Thank you so much. Mark. this is
exactly what I was hoping for.

730
00:53:45.274 --> 00:53:47.557
I look quite pretty.

731
00:53:54.825 --> 00:53:56.983
You've stayed rather close.

732
00:54:51.088 --> 00:54:53.372
They're all of me.

733
00:54:57.428 --> 00:55:00.597
Yeah. Yeah.

734
00:55:00.639 --> 00:55:02.713
Yes.

735
00:55:32.879 --> 00:55:34.870
But...

736
00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:38.175
you never talk to me.

737
00:55:40.553 --> 00:55:42.628
You always talk to Peter.

738
00:55:45.182 --> 00:55:47.393
You don't like me.

739
00:55:48.602 --> 00:55:50.677
I hope it's useful.

740
00:55:50.729 --> 00:55:53.816
Don't show it around too much.

741
00:55:53.858 --> 00:55:57.059
Needs a bit of editing.

742
00:55:57.111 --> 00:56:00.812
Look. I've got to get to a... lunch.

743
00:56:00.864 --> 00:56:02.824
Early lunch.

744
00:56:02.866 --> 00:56:05.817
You can just show
yourself out. can't you?

745
00:56:11.499 --> 00:56:15.878
It's a... self-preservation
thing. you see.

746
00:56:27.098 --> 00:56:30.185
<i># Oh I am what I am</i>

747
00:56:30.226 --> 00:56:33.177

Yeah.

762
00:57:19.733 --> 00:57:22.736
Annie. my darling. my dream. my boat.

763
00:57:23.695 --> 00:57:25.905
Ah...

764
00:57:25.947 --> 00:57:28.565
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.

765
00:57:28.617 --> 00:57:30.692
Anything for the hero of the hour.

766
00:57:32.495 --> 00:57:35.498
Don't ask me why. and don't
read stuff into this.

767
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.990
it's just a weird personality thing.

768
00:57:38.042 --> 00:57:41.129
But. erm. you know
Natalie who works here?

769
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:43.704
The chubby girl?

770
00:57:43.756 --> 00:57:45.831
Would we call her chubby?

771
00:57:45.883 --> 00:57:50.544
I think there's a pretty sizeable
arse there. yes. sir. Huge thighs.

772
00:57:51.638 --> 00:57:54.673
Yeah. Well. whatever. erm...

773
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:59.678
I'm sure she's a lovely girl but
I wonder if you could. erm...

774
00:58:02.274 --> 00:58:05.309
redistribute her?

775
00:58:05.361 --> 00:58:07.436
It's done.

776
00:58:42.397 --> 00:58:44.555
Hey. Sammo. Can't sleep?

777
00:58:45.274 --> 00:58:47.433
I got some terrible news today.

778
00:58:47.485 --> 00:58:49.476
Let's have it.

779
00:58:49.528 --> 00:58:52.615
- Joanna's going back to America.
- Your girl's American?

780
00:58:52.657 --> 00:58:55.191
Yes. she's American.

781
00:58:55.243 --> 00:58:57.651
And she's not my girl.

782
00:58:57.703 --> 00:59:01.832
And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

783
00:59:01.874 --> 00:59:04.085
That is bad news.

784
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.662
Well. we need Kate

785
00:59:08.714 --> 00:59:12.050
and we need Leo. and we need them now.

786
00:59:12.092 --> 00:59:13.917
<i>Come on.</i>

787
00:59:17.598 --> 00:59:19.756
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

788
00:59:19.808 --> 00:59:22.091
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

789
00:59:22.144 --> 00:59:26.637
<i>- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.</i>

790
00:59:27.565 --> 00:59:30.183
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

791
00:59:30.235 --> 00:59:32.852
- Fool!
- Get off. you big bully.

792
00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:38.524
<i>All right. open your eyes.</i>

793
00:59:41.663 --> 00:59:45.281
You know. Sammy. I'm sure
she's unique and extraordinary

794
00:59:45.333 --> 00:59:48.336
but general wisdom is that in the end.

795
00:59:48.377 --> 00:59:51.829
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

796
00:59:52.924 --> 00:59:54.999
There was for Kate and Leo.

797
00:59:55.051 --> 00:59:57.720
There was for you.

798
00:59:57.762 --> 00:59:59.722
And there is for me.

799
00:59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.755
She's the one.

800
01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:06.312
Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

801
01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:09.554
Yeah. I know. Same as Mum.

802
01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:22.359
Yeah.

803
01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:29.241
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

804
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.226
Oh. Appolo... Erm. appologia.

805
01:00:47.268 --> 01:00:52.513
Grande. er... grande familio.
grande tradizione de Christmas presents.

806
01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:54.640
Stupido.

807
01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:23.460
Well. goodbye.

808
01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:25.639
Thank you.

809
01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:31.176
Erm. it was. erm...

810
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:35.304
I will miss you.

811
01:01:36.608 --> 01:01:39.527
And your very slow typing...

812
01:01:40.612 --> 01:01:43.479
and your very bad driving.

813
01:02:44.132 --> 01:02:48.344
<i># You know I love Christmas. I always will</i>

814
01:02:49.804 --> 01:02:54.382
<i># My mind's made up. the way that I feel</i>

815
01:02:55.810 --> 01:03:00.387
<i># There's no beginning. there'll be no end</i>

816
01:03:00.439 --> 01:03:05.476
<i># Cos on Christmas you can depend</i>

817
01:03:11.659 --> 01:03:13.733
Daniel!

818
01:03:14.828 --> 01:03:18.906
- I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

819
01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:22.075
Well. girls love musicians. don't they?

820
01:03:22.127 --> 01:03:25.078
- Even the weird ones get girlfriends.
- That's right.

821
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.580
Meat Loaf definitely
got laid at least once.

822
01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:31.460
For God's sake. Ringo
Starr married a Bond girl.

823
01:03:31.512 --> 01:03:35.557
Whatever. There's this big concert at
the end of term and Joanna's in it.

824
01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:39.425
I thought if I was in the
band and played superbly.

825
01:03:39.477 --> 01:03:42.596
she might fall in love with
me. What do you think?

826
01:03:42.648 --> 01:03:45.515
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's stellar.

827
01:03:45.567 --> 01:03:49.477
Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

828
01:03:49.529 --> 01:03:52.866
- I don't play a musical instrument?
- Yes. sir.

829
01:03:53.658 --> 01:03:55.817
A tiny. insignificant detail.

830
01:04:20.498 --> 01:04:23.777
<i># Love can be a many splendored thing</i>

831
01:04:23.778 --> 01:04:27.609

01:04:27.244 --> 01:04:31.190
<i># A dozen roses. diamond rings</i>

01:04:31.225 --> 01:04:33.368
<i># Dreams for sale...</i>

834
01:04:33.405 --> 01:04:36.158
I suppose I'd better do the duty round.

835
01:04:36.199 --> 01:04:38.274
You're a saint.

836
01:04:39.194 --> 01:04:42.838
<i># And you just want the world to see</i>

837
01:04:43.374 --> 01:04:45.100
<i># But like a drug that...</i>

838
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.919
Any chance of a dance with the boss?

839
01:04:48.962 --> 01:04:51.245
Yeah. sure. sure.

840
01:04:51.297 --> 01:04:53.665
As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.

841
01:04:56.428 --> 01:04:58.471
Not my boyfriend.

842
01:04:58.472 --> 01:05:01.756
<i># Make your heart believe a lie</i>

843
01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:05.196

You're looking very pretty tonight.

847
01:05:18.116 --> 01:05:20.190
It's for you.

848
01:05:21.619 --> 01:05:23.694

857
01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:58.436

- Very bad indeed.</i>

858
01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:01.689

859
01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:04.828

861
01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:13.909

01:06:15.045 --> 01:06:17.747

- Of course I do. Michael.</i>

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.885
<i>Do you want a preview? You old flirt.</i>

864
01:06:24.388 --> 01:06:26.296
<i>That'll never make number one.</i>

866
01:06:33.147 --> 01:06:36.765
I suppose it's his job to
dance with everyone. isn't it?

867
01:06:36.817 --> 01:06:39.027
Some more than others.

868
01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:44.450
Just one dance?

869
01:06:44.491 --> 01:06:47.994
- Before we run out of chances.
- Who. me?

870
01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:52.249
- Unless you just...
- No! No! Good.

871
01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:54.449
Yes. Thanks.

- No. that's good.

Just. erm. would you
excuse me for one second?

899
01:08:59.664 --> 01:09:02.365
- Sure.
- Just one second.

900
01:09:09.758 --> 01:09:13.177
Erm. OK. that's done. Erm...

901
01:09:14.762 --> 01:09:18.298

Hello. Hi. Hello. darling.

918
01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:23.888
No. no. I'm not busy. No. fire away.

919
01:11:24.972 --> 01:11:26.849
Right.

920
01:11:26.891 --> 01:11:30.937
Yes. I... I'm not quite
sure it's gonna be possible

921
01:11:30.979 --> 01:11:33.731
to get the Pope on the
phone tonight but...

922
01:11:34.816 --> 01:11:40.405
Yes. Yes. I'm sure he's
very good at exorcism but...

923
01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:46.358
Well. I'm sure...

924
01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:50.237
Jon Bon Jovi is as well and
I'll definitely look into it.

925
01:11:50.289 --> 01:11:53.876
OK? OK. I'll talk to you later.

926
01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:55.993
All right. bye-bye.

927
01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:05.294
- Sorry about that.
- No. it's fine.

928
01:12:05.346 --> 01:12:08.348
It's my brother. he's not
well. he calls a lot.

929
01:12:10.308 --> 01:12:12.800
- I'm sorry.
- No. it's fine. It's fine.

930
01:12:12.852 --> 01:12:16.221
I mean. it's not
really fine. it is what it is.

931
01:12:16.273 --> 01:12:19.933
and there being no parents
now and us being over here.

932
01:12:19.985 --> 01:12:25.406
it's my job to keep an eye on him.
Not my job. obviously. I'm glad to do it...

933
01:12:25.448 --> 01:12:30.276
That's OK. Life is full of
interruptions and complications.

934
01:12:32.872 --> 01:12:34.447
So...

935
01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:53.465
Will it make him better?

936
01:12:54.852 --> 01:12:56.645
No.

937
01:12:56.687 --> 01:12:58.762
Then maybe...

938
01:12:59.523 --> 01:13:01.598
don't answer.

939
01:13:09.074 --> 01:13:11.649
Hey. How you doing?

940
01:13:12.369 --> 01:13:15.372
Right. right. Oh. no. please.

941
01:13:15.414 --> 01:13:18.698
Oh. please. please don't.
little darling.

942
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:23.546
Between the two of us we'll find the
answer and it won't hurt any more.

943
01:13:23.588 --> 01:13:25.579
No. no.

944
01:13:25.632 --> 01:13:27.707
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

945
01:13:29.344 --> 01:13:32.681
Of course. if you want me
to come over I will.

946
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:36.267
OK.

947
01:13:45.234 --> 01:13:48.101
That was a good night.

948
01:13:48.154 --> 01:13:50.854
- Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

949
01:13:50.906 --> 01:13:52.565
It's true.

950
01:13:52.617 --> 01:13:56.829
Nowadays the only clothes I can get
into were once owned by Pavarotti.

951
01:13:56.871 --> 01:13:59.790
I always think Pavarotti
dresses very well.

952
01:14:03.336 --> 01:14:05.411
Mia's very pretty.

953
01:14:07.298 --> 01:14:09.372
Is she?

954
01:14:10.759 --> 01:14:13.793
You know she is. darling.

955
01:14:13.845 --> 01:14:16.056
Be careful there.

956
01:14:39.287 --> 01:14:42.071
Have you been watching stuff on TV?

957
01:14:43.416 --> 01:14:45.991
Yeah.

958
01:14:46.044 --> 01:14:48.035
- Every night.
- Good.

959
01:14:48.087 --> 01:14:50.245
And every day.

960
01:14:57.179 --> 01:15:02.132
- The nurses are trying to kill me.
- Nobody's trying to kill you. babe.

961
01:15:08.232 --> 01:15:10.307
Thank you.

962
01:15:13.028 --> 01:15:15.521
Don't do that. my darling.

963
01:15:17.825 --> 01:15:19.900
Thank you.

964
01:15:26.959 --> 01:15:29.117
Don't do that.

965
01:16:01.784 --> 01:16:06.278
Right. Back at three. Christmas
shopping. never easy or pleasant.

966
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:09.250
Are you gonna get me something?

967
01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:11.366
Er...

968
01:16:12.878 --> 01:16:14.954
I don't know. I hadn't thought.

969
01:16:15.006 --> 01:16:16.882
Where's Sarah. by the way?

970
01:16:16.924 --> 01:16:19.708
She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

971
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.503
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

972
01:16:23.555 --> 01:16:27.716
- See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

973
01:16:31.104 --> 01:16:33.179
A lot.

974
01:16:45.243 --> 01:16:47.453
Are you gonna give me something?

975
01:16:48.454 --> 01:16:51.208
I thought I made it clear last night.

976
01:16:51.249 --> 01:16:54.992
When it comes to me.
you can have everything.

977
01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:58.548
So. erm. what do you need?

978
01:16:59.799 --> 01:17:03.845
Something along the stationery
line? Are you short of staplers?

979
01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:07.338
No. I don't want something I need.

980
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:10.841
I want something I want.
Something pretty.

981
01:17:12.019 --> 01:17:13.927
Right.

982
01:17:15.023 --> 01:17:17.097
Right.

983
01:17:24.448 --> 01:17:28.192
Sorry I'm late. I had to
drop off Bernie at rehearsal.

984
01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.749
Right. listen. you keep
yourself occupied

985
01:17:34.791 --> 01:17:37.961
while I do the boring
stuff for our mothers.

986
01:17:59.899 --> 01:18:02.057
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

987
01:18:02.109 --> 01:18:04.863
Looking for anything
in particular. sir?

988
01:18:04.904 --> 01:18:08.564
Yes. That necklace there.
how much is it?

989
01:18:08.616 --> 01:18:10.826
It's �270.

990
01:18:12.161 --> 01:18:16.290
- Erm. all right. Er. I'll have it.
- Lovely.

991
01:18:19.293 --> 01:18:22.410
Would you like it... giftwrapped?

992
01:18:22.463 --> 01:18:25.246
- Yes. all right.
- Lovely.

993
01:18:28.344 --> 01:18:30.585
Let me just pop it in the box.

994
01:18:32.264 --> 01:18:33.724
There.

995
01:18:33.765 --> 01:18:37.383
- Look. could we be quite quick?
- Certainly. sir.

996
01:18:37.435 --> 01:18:40.303
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

997
01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:49.437
- There.
- That's great.

998
01:18:49.489 --> 01:18:52.326
Not quite finished.

999
01:18:55.829 --> 01:19:00.541
- I don't need a bag. I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh. this isn't a bag. sir.

1000
01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:04.004
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1001
01:19:27.193 --> 01:19:29.601
Could we be quite quick. please?

1002
01:19:29.653 --> 01:19:32.437
Prontissimo.

1003
01:19:50.716 --> 01:19:53.468
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick. sir.

1004
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:57.044
- Actually. I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it. sir.

1005
01:19:57.097 --> 01:19:59.380
Want to bet?

1006
01:19:59.432 --> 01:20:01.882
Tis but the work of a moment.

1007
01:20:05.355 --> 01:20:07.638
There we go. Almost finished.

1008
01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:12.184
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1009
01:20:12.236 --> 01:20:15.354
No. sir. we're going to pop
it in the Christmas box.

1010
01:20:15.407 --> 01:20:17.033
I don't want a Christmas box.

1011
01:20:17.075 --> 01:20:19.858
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1012
01:20:19.911 --> 01:20:21.704
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1013
01:20:21.746 --> 01:20:24.498
- All we need now...
- Oh. God.

1014
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.751
is a sprig of holly.
- No. no. no. no.

1015
01:20:26.793 --> 01:20:28.836
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1016
01:20:28.878 --> 01:20:31.578
Leave it.

1017
01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:35.623
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1018
01:20:35.676 --> 01:20:38.345
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1019
01:20:38.386 --> 01:20:42.047
after 13 years of Mr
Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

1020
01:20:42.099 --> 01:20:44.174
Actually. I do love this one.

1023
01:20:54.945 --> 01:20:58.312
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1024
01:20:58.364 --> 01:21:01.398
Had to rent out my flat
to pay for my ticket.

1025
01:21:01.451 --> 01:21:04.819
You're not actually going
ahead with this stupid plan?

1026
01:21:04.871 --> 01:21:06.612
I bloody am.

1027
01:21:06.665 --> 01:21:10.001
You think this is full of
clothes? Like hell it is.

1028
01:21:10.043 --> 01:21:13.129
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

1029
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:16.622
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect. keep that going.

1030
01:21:16.674 --> 01:21:18.958
Look. erm...

1031
01:21:20.303 --> 01:21:22.878
sorry to be a bit forward
and all that but...

1032
01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:27.591
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink.
do you? I mean. nothing implied.

1033
01:21:27.644 --> 01:21:33.263
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1034
01:21:33.315 --> 01:21:36.652
Obviously. if you don't
want to. you don't have to. I...

1035
01:21:36.693 --> 01:21:38.434
I'm rambling now. sorry.

1036
01:21:38.487 --> 01:21:41.188
No. That would be lovely.

1037
01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.607
Oh. great.

1038
01:21:45.953 --> 01:21:47.277
Yay!

1039
01:21:47.329 --> 01:21:49.487
You know. that is really great.

1040
01:21:49.539 --> 01:21:54.492
Normally. I'm really shy. takes me ages
to get the courage up. so thank you.

1041
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:06.421
- Explain again why you're so late.
- Can't a man have any secrets?

1042
01:22:06.473 --> 01:22:10.716
We've been waiting for hours.
it's the first ever preview.

1046
01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:23.479
It was a starry
night in ancient Jerusalem

1047
01:22:23.531 --> 01:22:26.732
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1048
01:22:34.833 --> 01:22:38.535
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1049
01:22:38.588 --> 01:22:41.622
Is this the way to the train station?

1050
01:22:41.674 --> 01:22:44.843
I would like half-pint of churly.

1051
01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:48.628
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1052
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:52.466
Oh. my God. I've got a
terrible stomachache.

1053
01:22:52.518 --> 01:22:54.801
It must have been the prawns.

1054
01:22:54.853 --> 01:22:57.387
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1055
01:22:58.565 --> 01:23:02.778
My goodness. this is a very big fish!

1056
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.854

1069
01:23:55.037 --> 01:23:58.457

She's crazy about English guys.

Uh-huh.

01:25:02.143 --> 01:25:06.137
- Hey. girls.
- Carol-Anne. come meet Colin.

1090
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:08.806
He's from England.

1091
01:25:08.859 --> 01:25:13.102
Well. step aside. ladies.
This one's on me.

1092
01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:18.816
Hey. gorgeous.

1093
01:25:20.578 --> 01:25:22.705
That is so funny!

1094
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.407
- What do you call that?
- Er. bottle.

1095
01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.586
"Bottle".

1096
01:25:28.628 --> 01:25:30.703
- What about this?
- Er. straw.

1097
01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:32.632
"Straw".

1098
01:25:32.673 --> 01:25:34.665
- What about this?
- Table.

1099
01:25:35.926 --> 01:25:38.001
- Table. The same.
- Oh. it's the same.

1100
01:25:38.053 --> 01:25:41.474
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1101
01:25:41.516 --> 01:25:44.352
I'll just check into a
motel like in the movies.

1102
01:25:44.393 --> 01:25:47.730
Oh. my God. Oh. my God. that is so cute.

1103
01:25:47.771 --> 01:25:52.516
No. no. no. listen. This may be a
bit pushy cos we just met you but...

1104
01:25:52.568 --> 01:25:55.102
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1105
01:25:55.154 --> 01:25:57.312
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1106
01:25:57.364 --> 01:26:00.367
Well. if it's not too
much of an inconvenience.

1107
01:26:00.408 --> 01:26:03.443
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1108
01:26:03.496 --> 01:26:05.622
What?

1109
01:26:05.664 --> 01:26:09.324
Well. we're not the richest
of girls. you know.

1110
01:26:09.376 --> 01:26:14.371
So we just have a
little bed and no couch.

1111
01:26:14.423 --> 01:26:17.791
So you'd have to share
with all three of us.

1112
01:26:17.843 --> 01:26:24.296
And on this cold. cold night it's
gonna be crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1113
01:26:24.348 --> 01:26:27.133
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1114
01:26:27.185 --> 01:26:29.594
No?

1115
01:26:29.646 --> 01:26:32.179
Which means...

1116
01:26:32.231 --> 01:26:34.442
we would be naked.

1117
01:26:39.114 --> 01:26:40.771
No. no. I think it'd be fine.

1118
01:26:40.823 --> 01:26:43.232
- Great.
- Erm...

1119
01:26:43.284 --> 01:26:46.401
The thing that's gonna
make it more crowded...

1120
01:26:46.453 --> 01:26:48.664
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1121
01:26:48.706 --> 01:26:50.583
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1122
01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:54.952
Don't worry. you're totally gonna
like her cos she is "the sexy one".

1123
01:26:55.004 --> 01:26:57.788
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1124
01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.708
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh. and he's a Christian.

01:31:15.132 --> 01:31:19.000
By the way. I feel bad. I never ask
you how your love life is going.

1190
01:31:19.053 --> 01:31:21.044
Er-huh!

1191
01:31:21.096 --> 01:31:22.921
No.

1192
01:31:22.973 --> 01:31:25.923
As you know. that
was a done deal long ago.

1193
01:31:27.228 --> 01:31:32.222
Unless Claudia Schiffer calls. in which
case I want you out of here straightaway.

1194
01:31:32.274 --> 01:31:35.527
- you wee motherless mongrel.
- Oh!

1195
01:31:35.568 --> 01:31:39.437
No. no. We'll want to have sex
in every room. including yours.

1196
01:31:40.198 --> 01:31:43.285
It's a rainy
Christmas Eve all over the UK

1197
01:31:43.326 --> 01:31:47.455
and the question is who is number one
on the Radio One chart show tonight?

1198
01:31:47.497 --> 01:31:51.491
Ls it Blue or the unexpected
Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?

1199
01:31:51.543 --> 01:31:55.453
You might have guessed it
although you may not believe it.

1200
01:31:55.505 --> 01:31:57.746
It's Billy Mack.

1201
01:31:59.925 --> 01:32:02.627
- You are the champion!
- Shh.

1202
01:32:02.679 --> 01:32:04.670
- Hi. Billy.
- Hello.

1203
01:32:04.722 --> 01:32:08.549
We're live across the
nation and you're number one.

1204
01:32:08.601 --> 01:32:11.218
- How will you be celebrating?
- I don't know.

1205
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:14.440
Er. either I could behave
like a real rock'n'roll loser

1206
01:32:14.482 --> 01:32:17.266
and get drunk with my fat manager...

1207
01:32:17.318 --> 01:32:19.445
or. when I hang up.

1208
01:32:19.486 --> 01:32:24.397
I'll be flooded by invitations to a
large number of glamorous parties.

1209
01:32:24.449 --> 01:32:28.110
Let's hope it's the latter. Here
it is. Number one. from Billy Mack.

1210
01:32:28.162 --> 01:32:32.405
- it's Christmas Is All Around.
- Oh. Jesus. not that crap again.

1211

1212
01:32:35.168 --> 01:32:37.660
Bill. it's for you. babe.

1213
01:32:38.672 --> 01:32:41.164
Hello. Elton.

1214
01:32:41.216 --> 01:32:44.719
O
- Of course. Of course.

1215
01:32:44.761 --> 01:32:48.181
Send an embarrassingly big
car and I'll be there.

1216
01:32:49.974 --> 01:32:53.676
It's gonna be a very good Christmas.

1217
01:33:01.652 --> 01:33:04.437
- Right.
- I'd better be getting inside. actually.

1218
01:33:04.489 --> 01:33:08.701
- My mum and... you know.
- Of course. yeah. It's getting a bit cold.

1219
01:33:08.743 --> 01:33:11.234
Erm...

1220
01:33:11.287 --> 01:33:14.123
- Well. good night.
- Night.

1221
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:18.586
Er...

1222
01:33:24.007 --> 01:33:27.094
Er... OK.

1223
01:33:39.815 --> 01:33:42.515
All I want for Christmas...

1224
01:33:42.567 --> 01:33:46.071
is you.

1225
01:33:46.112 --> 01:33:48.729
Right.

1226
01:33:48.781 --> 01:33:51.816
Thank you. Good.

1227
01:33:51.868 --> 01:33:53.776

Yes. oh. splendid.
It's lovely to see you all.

1235
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.356
I'm off. actually.

1236

Enough now.

1295
01:39:01.628 --> 01:39:06.289
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at Elton John's.

1296
01:39:06.341 --> 01:39:11.544
Well. I was there for a minute or
two and then I had an epiphany.

1297
01:39:11.596 --> 01:39:14.005
- Really?
- Yeah.

1298
01:39:14.057 --> 01:39:16.184
Come on. Just come up.

1299
01:39:16.226 --> 01:39:19.395
So what was this epiphany?

1300
01:39:19.437 --> 01:39:22.221
Erm. it... it was about Christmas.

1301
01:39:22.273 --> 01:39:24.556
You realised it was all around.

1302
01:39:24.608 --> 01:39:29.020
No. I realised that Christmas is the
time to be with the people you love.

1303
01:39:30.114 --> 01:39:31.657
Right.

1304
01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:38.529
And I realised that. as dire chance
and fateful cockup would have it.

1305
01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:40.625
here I am.

1306
01:39:40.666 --> 01:39:42.991
mid-fifties.

1307
01:39:43.044 --> 01:39:46.244
and without knowing it.
I've spent most of my adult life

1308
01:39:46.296 --> 01:39:50.124
with a chubby employee.

1309
01:39:50.176 --> 01:39:52.928
And. much as it grieves me to say it.

1310
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:58.756
it might be that the people
I love is. in fact...

1311
01:39:59.851 --> 01:40:02.771
you.

1312
01:40:03.856 --> 01:40:05.983
Well. this is a surprise.

1313
01:40:06.024 --> 01:40:07.849
Yeah.

1314
01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:10.184
Ten minutes at Elton
John's and you're gay?

1315
01:40:10.236 --> 01:40:12.311
No. look. I'm serious here.

1316
01:40:12.363 --> 01:40:18.234
I left Elton's and a hefty number of
half-naked chicks with their mouths open

1317
01:40:18.286 --> 01:40:22.613
in order to hang out
with you at Christmas.

1318
01:40:24.166 --> 01:40:29.620
- Well. Bill...
- It's a terrible. terrible mistake. chubs...

1319
01:40:33.426 --> 01:40:36.793
but you turn out to be the
fucking love of my life.

1320
01:40:40.266 --> 01:40:44.176
And to be honest.
despite all my complaining...

1321
01:40:46.063 --> 01:40:48.513
we have had a wonderful life.

1322
01:40:53.029 --> 01:40:54.738
Well...

01:40:56.532 --> 01:40:58.742
thank you.

1324
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:03.445
I mean. come on. it's been an honour.

1325
01:41:04.957 --> 01:41:07.365
I feel very proud.

1326
01:41:07.417 --> 01:41:09.576

1327
01:41:20.472 --> 01:41:23.923

pissed and watch porn.

I'm very sorry about
the thing that happened.

1331
01:41:52.044 --> 01:41:55.162
It was a very odd moment and
I feel like a prize idiot.

1332
01:41:55.214 --> 01:41:57.122
Particularly because...

1333
01:41:57.174 --> 01:41:59.958

when can you. eh? -

1334

Hello. Sorry to disturb.

1366
01:44:26.362 --> 01:44:29.364
- Does Natalie live here?
- No.

1367
01:44:29.406 --> 01:44:31.564
She lives next door.

1368
01:44:34.035 --> 01:44:36.652
Ah. Brilliant.

1369
01:44:36.704 --> 01:44:39.708
You're not who I think
you are. are you?

1370
01:44:39.749 --> 01:44:41.876
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1371
01:44:41.918 --> 01:44:45.369
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

1372
01:44:45.421 --> 01:44:47.663
Merry Christmas to you.

1373
01:45:02.438 --> 01:45:06.265
Ah. Hello.

1374
01:45:06.317 --> 01:45:08.600
Is. er. Natalie in?

1375
01:45:08.652 --> 01:45:11.571
Oh. where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1376
01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:16.817
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1377
01:45:16.869 --> 01:45:21.988
Erm. this is my mum and my dad and
my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1378
01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.000
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1379
01:45:24.042 --> 01:45:27.869
And. erm... this is the Prime Minister.

1380
01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:30.841
Yes. we can see that. darling.

1381
01:45:30.882 --> 01:45:33.718
And erm. unfortunately. we're very late.

1382
01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.877
It's the school
Christmas concert. you see. David.

1383
01:45:36.929 --> 01:45:40.381
All the local schools have joined
together. even St Basil's...

1384
01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:44.302
- Too much detail. Mum.
- Anyway. how can we help. sir?

1385
01:45:44.354 --> 01:45:48.263
Well. I... just needed Natalie...

1386
01:45:51.027 --> 01:45:53.102
on some state business.

1387
01:45:53.154 --> 01:45:57.783
- Oh.
- Right. yes. Of course.

1388
01:45:57.825 --> 01:45:59.618
Right. er...

1389
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:02.413
Well. perhaps you should
come on later. Plumpy.

1390
01:46:02.455 --> 01:46:03.863
Er. Natalie.

1391
01:46:03.915 --> 01:46:06.448
I don't want to make you
late for the concert.

1392
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:10.160
- No. it's nothing. really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1393
01:46:10.212 --> 01:46:14.373
- No. really. it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1394
01:46:14.425 --> 01:46:16.469
Eight is a lot of legs. David.

1395
01:46:20.848 --> 01:46:22.974
Listen. why don't I give you a lift

1396
01:46:23.016 --> 01:46:28.136
and then we can talk about this
state business business in the car.

1397
01:46:29.690 --> 01:46:31.233
OK.

1398
01:46:31.274 --> 01:46:34.142
- Lovely. yes.
- Thank you.

1399
01:46:34.194 --> 01:46:36.321
Hold tight. everybody.

1400
01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:45.747
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1401
01:46:45.788 --> 01:46:48.489
Ah. right. Well. er...

1402
01:46:50.419 --> 01:46:52.660
I just wanted to say...

1403
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:56.747
thank you for the Christmas card.

1404
01:46:56.799 --> 01:46:58.624
You're welcome.

1405
01:46:58.676 --> 01:47:00.636
Look. I'm so sorry about that day.

1406
01:47:00.678 --> 01:47:04.015
I came in and he slinked
towards me and there was a fire

1407
01:47:04.057 --> 01:47:08.550
and he's the President of the United
States and nothing happened. I promise.

1408
01:47:08.602 --> 01:47:11.772
I just felt like such a fool because...

1409
01:47:11.814 --> 01:47:15.099
I think about you all
the time. actually.

1410
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:18.571
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1411
01:47:18.612 --> 01:47:20.270
love.
- Oh. wow.

1412
01:47:20.322 --> 01:47:22.991
That really was just
round the corner. Er...

1413
01:47:24.701 --> 01:47:26.777
Erm...

1414
01:47:29.248 --> 01:47:31.489
Ow!

1415
01:47:38.007 --> 01:47:40.290
Well. look. I...

1416
01:47:42.052 --> 01:47:44.585
I think I'd better not
come in. you know?

1417
01:47:45.555 --> 01:47:49.141
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1418
01:47:49.184 --> 01:47:52.802
No. please come. It'll be great.

1419
01:47:52.854 --> 01:47:55.554
No. I'd... I'd better not.

1420
01:47:56.649 --> 01:48:01.477
But I will be very sorry

1421
01:48:01.530 --> 01:48:03.656
to drive away from you.

1422
01:48:05.116 --> 01:48:07.326
Just give me one second.

1423
01:48:21.256 --> 01:48:24.426
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1424
01:48:24.468 --> 01:48:27.586
- Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1425
01:48:30.682 --> 01:48:32.757
No!

1426
01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:07.750
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1427
01:49:07.802 --> 01:49:10.012
OK. Terry. I won't be long.

1428
01:49:13.475 --> 01:49:16.394
Look. this has to be a
very secret visit. OK?

1429
01:49:16.436 --> 01:49:20.596
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1430
01:49:23.317 --> 01:49:26.571
Look. the sheep are ready
already and you're not even...

1431
01:49:26.612 --> 01:49:30.658
- Oh. David.
- Ah!

1432
01:49:30.699 --> 01:49:33.024
Oh. how are you?

1433
01:49:33.076 --> 01:49:37.154
Hi. guys. Hey. hey. hey. You all right?

1434
01:49:37.206 --> 01:49:39.364
What the hell are you doing here?

1435
01:49:39.416 --> 01:49:42.450
- Well. you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1436
01:49:42.502 --> 01:49:47.246
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1437
01:49:47.298 --> 01:49:49.207
I thought it was time I did.

1438
01:49:49.259 --> 01:49:52.679
I didn't want anyone to see.
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1439
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:55.171
Good luck. Daisy. good luck. Bernie.

1440
01:49:55.223 --> 01:49:58.966
I've never been gladder to
see my stupid big brother.

1441
01:49:59.018 --> 01:50:02.303
- Thank you.
- All right.

1442
01:50:02.355 --> 01:50:05.306
Oh. now. We haven't been introduced.

1443
01:50:05.358 --> 01:50:08.444
Right. Well. this is Gavin.

1444

- Hi.

1448
01:50:17.954 --> 01:50:20.028
Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1449
01:50:20.081 --> 01:50:22.291
20 years ago. you'd have been his type.

1450
01:50:22.333 --> 01:50:27.286
I'll be very careful. Don't try something.
sir. just because it's Christmas.

1451
01:50:27.338 --> 01:50:29.496
No. seriously.

- Smile.

1511

Little bow.

1512
01:54:34.578 --> 01:54:36.736
And a wave.

1513
01:54:50.052 --> 01:54:53.305
Absolutely no idea. I
mean. can you imagine?

1514
01:54:53.347 --> 01:54:55.474
I'll see you later. all right?

1515
01:54:55.516 --> 01:54:57.674
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1516
01:55:00.103 --> 01:55:04.264
Tell me. if you were in my position.
what would you do?

1517
01:55:04.316 --> 01:55:06.391
What position is that?

1518
01:55:06.443 --> 01:55:10.186
Lmagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1519
01:55:10.238 --> 01:55:13.356
and. come Christmas.
gave it to somebody else.

1520
01:55:13.409 --> 01:55:16.192
- Oh. Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1521
01:55:16.244 --> 01:55:18.913
- Good night.
- Night. darling. Happy Christmas.

1522
01:55:18.955 --> 01:55:21.958
Would you wait around to find
out if it's just a necklace

1523
01:55:21.999 --> 01:55:24.408
or if it's sex and a necklace

1524
01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:28.162
or if. worst of all.
it's a necklace and love?

1525
01:55:29.424 --> 01:55:34.585
Would you stay? Knowing life would
always be a little bit worse?

1526
01:55:34.637 --> 01:55:38.141
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh. God.

1527
01:55:42.728 --> 01:55:45.564
I am so in the wrong.

1528
01:55:45.606 --> 01:55:47.681
A classic fool.

1529
01:55:47.733 --> 01:55:50.935
Yes. but you've also
made a fool out of me.

1530
01:55:50.987 --> 01:55:53.854
You've made the life
I lead foolish. too.

1531
01:55:56.241 --> 01:55:59.244
Darling. Darlings!

1532
01:55:59.286 --> 01:56:02.487
Oh. you were wonderful.

1533
01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:05.574
My little lobster. you were so...

1534
01:56:05.626 --> 01:56:07.951
What is that word?

1535
01:56:08.003 --> 01:56:10.244
Orange.

1536
01:56:10.297 --> 01:56:13.384
Come on. I've got
treats at home. Dad's coming.

1537
01:56:14.843 --> 01:56:19.587
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming. son.

1538
01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:23.716
- Thanks. Plan didn't work. though.
- Tell her. then.

1539
01:56:23.768 --> 01:56:25.677
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1540
01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:28.679
No way. Anyway. they fly tonight.

1541
01:56:28.732 --> 01:56:34.070
Even better. Sam. you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1542
01:56:35.654 --> 01:56:37.897
I never told your mum enough.

1543
01:56:37.949 --> 01:56:42.411
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1544
01:56:43.537 --> 01:56:47.833
You've seen the films. kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1545
01:56:49.794 --> 01:56:54.538
OK. Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get
the shit kicked out of us by love.

1546
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:56.915
Yes.

1547
01:56:56.967 --> 01:56:59.292
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1548
01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:03.714
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1549
01:57:03.766 --> 01:57:05.924
That's OK.

1550
01:57:05.976 --> 01:57:09.427
- My fault.
- No. no. really. it wasn't.

1551
01:57:09.479 --> 01:57:12.398
You're Sam's dad. aren't you?

1552
01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:15.360
Yeah. Stepdad. actually.

1553
01:57:15.402 --> 01:57:18.238
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1554
01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:20.073
Carol.

1555
01:57:20.115 --> 01:57:24.525
- OK. I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1556
01:57:25.913 --> 01:57:28.238
I hope we'll meet again. Karen.

1557
01:57:28.290 --> 01:57:30.531
Carol.

1558
01:57:31.876 --> 01:57:36.505
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1559
01:57:44.347 --> 01:57:46.421
- Tell her.
- What?

1560
01:57:46.474 --> 01:57:49.508
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1561
01:57:53.147 --> 01:57:55.274
- Look. there she is.
- Where?

1562
01:57:55.316 --> 01:57:57.599
Over there.

1563
01:57:59.444 --> 01:58:01.489
Oh. no.

1564
01:58:02.573 --> 01:58:05.576
It's OK. we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1565
01:58:20.757 --> 01:58:22.884
Good evening.

1566
01:58:22.926 --> 01:58:25.961
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1567
01:58:26.013 --> 01:58:29.714
I am here to ask your daughter

1568
01:58:29.766 --> 01:58:31.726
for her hands in marriage.

1569
01:58:31.768 --> 01:58:34.009
You want to marry my daughter?

1570
01:58:34.062 --> 01:58:35.970
Yes.

1571
01:58:36.022 --> 01:58:37.482
Come here.

1572
01:58:37.524 --> 01:58:39.067
there is a man at the door.

1573
01:58:40.652 --> 01:58:42.862
He wants to marry you.

1574
01:58:42.904 --> 01:58:44.280
But I've never seen him before.

1575
01:58:44.322 --> 01:58:45.729
Who cares?

1576
01:58:45.781 --> 01:58:48.023
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1577
01:58:48.075 --> 01:58:51.110
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1578
01:58:51.162 --> 01:58:55.906
Pardon me. I'm meaning your other daughter
- Aurelia.

1579
01:58:55.958 --> 01:58:59.701
She's not here
- she's at work. I'll take you.

1580
01:58:59.753 --> 01:59:01.245
You! Stay here.

1581
01:59:01.297 --> 01:59:04.248
As if I would. Stupid!

1582
01:59:07.177 --> 01:59:11.973
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1583
01:59:15.769 --> 01:59:17.844
Wait. Wait.

1584
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:22.598
Oh. no.

1585
01:59:24.110 --> 01:59:25.988
You better not say yes. Father.

1586
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:29.032
Shut up. Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1587
01:59:34.162 --> 01:59:37.781
- Look. we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1588
01:59:37.833 --> 01:59:42.243
Not even to let the boy say
goodbye to the love of his life?

1589
01:59:43.963 --> 01:59:45.923
No.

1590
01:59:48.008 --> 01:59:51.210
- I'm sorry. Sam.
- Boarding pass. sir?

1591
01:59:51.262 --> 01:59:54.849
Just a moment. I know I've got
it. Would you hang on to that?

1592
01:59:54.891 --> 01:59:56.934
- Unless...
- What?

1593
01:59:56.976 --> 01:59:59.551
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1594
01:59:59.603 --> 02:00:02.138
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1595
02:00:02.774 --> 02:00:05.891
- OK.
- Yes!

1596
02:00:05.943 --> 02:00:10.322
I must have left them where
I was having a cup of coffee.

1597
02:01:23.143 --> 02:01:25.761
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1598
02:01:25.813 --> 02:01:28.023
Cool!

1599
02:02:02.265 --> 02:02:04.340
Joanna.

1600
02:02:05.393 --> 02:02:07.468
Sam?

1601
02:02:10.689 --> 02:02:14.986
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1602
02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:18.729
Oh. Jesus. Here. I've gotta run.

1603
02:03:11.248 --> 02:03:13.824
- Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1604
02:03:13.876 --> 02:03:15.920
This man wants to marry her.

1605
02:03:15.962 --> 02:03:18.714
He can't do that
- she's our best waitress.

1606
02:03:37.650 --> 02:03:39.443
Boa noite. Aurelia.

1607
02:03:40.986 --> 02:03:43.061
Boa noite. Jamie.

1608
02:03:58.377 --> 02:04:01.381
Beautiful Aurelia...

1609
02:04:01.423 --> 02:04:05.635
I've come here with
a view to asking you...

1610
02:04:06.719 --> 02:04:08.929
to marriage me.

1611
02:04:10.264 --> 02:04:15.092
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1612
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:23.725
but sometimes things
are so transparency.

1613
02:04:25.029 --> 02:04:28.449
they don't need evidential proof.

1614
02:04:30.367 --> 02:04:36.374
And I will inhabit here. or
you can inhabit with me in England.

1615
02:04:36.415 --> 02:04:38.949
Definitely go for England. girl.

1616
02:04:39.001 --> 02:04:42.285
You'll meet Prince William
- then you can marry him instead.

1617
02:04:43.296 --> 02:04:49.303
Of course I don't expecting
you to be as foolish as me.

1618
02:04:50.179 --> 02:04:54.891
and of course I prediction you say no...

1619
02:04:55.975 --> 02:05:03.890
but it's Christmas and
I just wanted to... check.

1620
02:05:08.112 --> 02:05:11.730
Oh. God
- say yes. you skinny moron.

1621
02:05:14.536 --> 02:05:16.610
Thank you.

1622
02:05:18.414 --> 02:05:20.489
That will be nice.

1623
02:05:22.751 --> 02:05:25.536
Yes is being my answer.

1624
02:05:27.215 --> 02:05:29.540
Easy question.

1625
02:05:29.592 --> 02:05:32.042
What did you say?

1626
02:05:32.094 --> 02:05:33.470
Yes. of course.

1627
02:05:36.224 --> 02:05:38.549
Bravo!

1628
02:06:03.917 --> 02:06:06.075
You learned English?

1629
02:06:06.586 --> 02:06:08.796
Just in cases.

1630
02:06:42.371 --> 02:06:45.207
I may not always love you

1631
02:06:46.166 --> 02:06:49.670
But long as there are stars above you...

1632
02:06:49.712 --> 02:06:51.171
Hello. Daisy.

1633
02:06:51.213 --> 02:06:54.164
- This one's Greta.
- Hello. Greta.

1634
02:06:54.216 --> 02:06:56.582
I'll make you so sure about it...

1635
02:06:56.635 --> 02:07:00.681
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1636
02:07:00.722 --> 02:07:03.892
- Mark. didn't see you there.
- Just thought I'd tag along.

1637
02:07:03.934 --> 02:07:06.884
Jamie's friends are so good-looking.

1638
02:07:06.936 --> 02:07:09.220
He never tells me this.

1639
02:07:09.272 --> 02:07:12.442
I think maybe now I have
made the wrong choice.

1640
02:07:12.484 --> 02:07:14.194
picked wrong Englishman.

1641
02:07:14.236 --> 02:07:16.446
She can't speak English properly.

1642
02:07:17.322 --> 02:07:19.480
Dad! Dad!

1643
02:07:21.659 --> 02:07:23.285
Oh. God.

1644
02:07:23.327 --> 02:07:26.581
- Did you get us any presents?
- Matter of fact. I did.

1645
02:07:26.623 --> 02:07:29.073
Thanks. Dad.

1646
02:07:31.585 --> 02:07:34.703
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1647
02:07:36.758 --> 02:07:38.968
Good to have you back.

1648
02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:41.418
Come on. Home.

1649
02:07:44.181 --> 02:07:46.256
There she is.

1650
02:07:47.642 --> 02:07:51.428
- Hi.
- Hello.

1651
02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:55.525
- Aw. he should have kissed her.
- No. that's cool.

1652
02:07:57.527 --> 02:08:01.062
- All right?
- Hey. What are you two doing here?

1653
02:08:01.115 --> 02:08:03.648
- I might get a shag at last.
- Naughty.

1654
02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:07.151
- Got to go.
- Bye.

1655
02:08:07.203 --> 02:08:09.163
Yahoo!

1656
02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:14.701
Now. this is Harriet.

1657
02:08:15.795 --> 02:08:20.508
- Hi. Really pleased to meet you.
- Hello. Harriet.

1658
02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:24.460
I hope you don't mind. I
sort of brought my sister to stay.

1659
02:08:26.181 --> 02:08:30.643
This is Carla. She's real friendly.

1660
02:08:30.685 --> 02:08:33.010
Hello. you must be Tony.

1661
02:08:34.855 --> 02:08:36.983
