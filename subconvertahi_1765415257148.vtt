00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:45.500
-Oh man.
-Wow.

3
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:54.375
I haven't been here
since I was a little kid.

4
00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:56.334
I thought you grew up here.

5
00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:58.208
Like round the corner.

6
00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:03.042
I knocked my tooth out on that step.

7
00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.167
Got me brain damaged.

8
00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.333
It's not New York.
but... it's ours.

9
00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.417
I think it's gonna be pretty sick. no?

10
00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:36.625
Yeah?

11
00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.792
-I could send for my drum kit?
-No way.

12
00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:50.250
No?

13
00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.917
My uncle was a hoarder.
I didn't realise how much...

14
00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.125
space there was in here.

15
00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:00.917
It's peaceful.

16
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.750
I can just record
an album out here so easily.

17
00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.167
-Gracie!
-What?

18
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.542
I found an office!

19
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.542
Oh.

20
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.210
You can write
your Great American Novel up here.

21
00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:17.167
Whoa!

22
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.959
What?

23
00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:20.542
Um...

24
00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.000
It's alright.
It's just a little rat situation.

25
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.959
We should get a cat.

26
00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.833
You can write all day. every day.
Nothing but the birds singing.

27
00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.500
How did he die?

28
00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:39.333
Um...

29
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.792
I don't know.

30
00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.083
Here we are.

31
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.791
We need a broom.

32
00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.834
Hey. hey. hey.

33
00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:19.083
Hey.

34
00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:21.292
Hey.

35
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:23.583
<i>♪ Came on. let's twist again ♪</i>

36
00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:28.917
Hey! Where's your mommy?

37
00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.333
Pumpkin. where's your mommy?

38
00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:46.167
Oh. no!

39
00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:00.917
Where's Mommy?

40
00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.083
Oh. God.

41
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.833
Grace.

42
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.958
Mom wanted to stop by.

43
00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.167
Oh?

44
00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.250
I told her it wasn't a big deal.
It's like a "us" thing.

45
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.542
And it's just for six months.
anyway. so...

46
00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:13.375
Mm-hmm.

47
00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:15.500
I just feel kind of bad.

48
00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:18.917
'cause I think she just wants the company.

49
00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:21.625
I don't mind her coming.

50
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:28.417
It's weird. It's like she doesn't
know how to function any more.

51
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.030
She's still cooking for two people.
Did she tell you that?

52
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.375
It's too sweet.

53
00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:38.207
Yeah? No. it's nice.

54
00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:40.917
He liked it.

55
00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:45.500
A real mom would have baked a cake.

56
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:53.750
Want another one?

57
00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.875
Why is it so fuckin' hot?

58
00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:04.182
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

59
00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:06.709
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

60
00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:08.583
It's always hot.

61
00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:43.375
Boy's asleep.

62
00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:46.417
Mm-hmm.

63
00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:18.875
You wanna look?

64
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.397
How can you not give a shit
about the stars. Grace?

65
00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:27.667
Well. they make me feel like nothing.

66
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.750
I like they make me feel like
I'm part of something bigger.

67
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.917
You like to feel like nothing?

68
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.084
No.

69
00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:40.042
You know how many universes
there are out there?

70
00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:43.667
What are we doing in
the different universe? Are we together?

71
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.875
Sure we are.

72
00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:48.042
Am I a rock star?

73
00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:49.834
Hmm...

74
00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:52.042
Can you sing in a different universe?

75
00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:54.375
Hey.

76
00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:56.417
Yeah. I'm sure you're a rock star.

77
00:12:58.583 --> 00:12:59.667
Do we fuck?

78
00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.375
Uh-huh.

79
00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.042
All the time?

80
00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:08.708
Hey. what?

81
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:11.083
Do. We. Fuck?

82
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.958
Like rabbits.

83
00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:29.417
Do you hear him?

84
00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:31.625
No.

85
00:13:34.208 --> 00:13:35.708
He's crying. Listen.

86
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:39.125
Grace. it's totally silent.

87
00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:46.333
Am I boring you?

88
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.625
Not you. The universe.

89
00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:51.208
Who gives a shit?

90
00:13:58.417 --> 00:13:59.917
...and a wild party mom...

91
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.709
<i>I'm very well known as
Big Bouncy. the over-the-hill party girl.</i>

92
00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.375
<i>...swap lives
for two weeks.</i>

93
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.917
-<i>I hope you survive.</i>
<i>-Bye!</i>

94
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.792
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

95
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.584
<i>We are two worlds apart.</i>

96
00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:19.334
<i>I've never seen
anything good come out of alcohol.</i>

97
00:14:19.417 --> 00:14:21.500
<i>I've never
killed an animal before.</i>

98
00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:23.584
<i>Oh. my God!</i>

99
00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.042
<i>I'm talking!</i>

100
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:27.875
<i>I've never seen
a more disrespectful child.</i>

101
00:16:02.583 --> 00:16:04.292
<i>Does it feel like a girl?</i>

102
00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:07.333
<i>What does a girl feel like?</i>

103
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.375
<i>If it moves more on the right.
then you're probably having a boy.</i>

104
00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:14.125
<i>You didn't wanna know?</i>

105
00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.500
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

106
00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:20.375
Grace. I...

107
00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:23.292
I didn't find out
what I was having either.

108
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:24.584
I think that's nice.

109
00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:26.875
You didn't find out
'cause you wanted a girl.

110
00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.625
Ha. ha.

111
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:30.917
Oh. gosh. He forgets to drink.

112
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.584
-Harry. you gotta have a drink.
-He's fine.

113
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:36.375
No. I didn't. I wanted a baby.
I wanted whoever was in there.

114
00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.125
Yeah? And you got Jackson?

115
00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:39.584
Unlucky.

116
00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.084
I heard that. Auntie Jen.

117
00:16:43.917 --> 00:16:45.458
Are you off your food. Grace?

118
00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:48.750
-Leave her alone.
-You didn't eat.

119
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:51.500
Being pregnant makes your stomach shrink.

120
00:16:52.292 --> 00:16:53.292
That's bullshit.

121
00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:55.584
It's sucking on you
every minute of the day.

122
00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:58.084
Then you'll be famished.
I couldn't get enough in me.

123
00:16:58.167 --> 00:16:59.834
That never went away. did it?

124
00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:02.292
You can talk. What's your excuse?

125
00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:05.542
Never had a baby but always
ate as though you'd just had triplets.

126
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:09.958
You know. Grace.
if you get a screamer...

127
00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:11.917
She's not gonna get a screamer.

128
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.583
Jackson was a screamer.

129
00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:16.458
-That's a lie!
-Jackson was a sweetheart.

130
00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:19.583
The point is. if you do.
let the baby cry.

131
00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:22.958
Just walk away from it.
Don't let yourself get tired. stressed.

132
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.958
That's a horrible thing to say.

133
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:26.708
Slow fuckin' death.

134
00:17:26.791 --> 00:17:30.334
If you're not at your best. it's no good
for anyone. especially the baby.

135
00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.959
And a crying baby
doesn't mean it's in pain.

136
00:17:33.042 --> 00:17:35.709
It's the only way they have
of communicating.

137
00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:36.792
No. it's not.

138
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:40.417
People say that shit because
they wanna walk away from their kid.

139
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500
Anyway. all I do is take care of Harry.

140
00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.375
-Barely.
-If you need me...

141
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.834
-She doesn't.
-...we're just a walk away.

142
00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:49.958
What you doing in here. Pop?
Wanna watch the Grizzlies?

143
00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:53.375
Wanna open some of those presents?

144
00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.542
Whose presents?

145
00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:57.000
For the baby.

146
00:17:57.083 --> 00:18:00.334
No. I gotta sort out these shoes.

147
00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:03.167
-Okay.
-They're the wrong ones.

148
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.125
They look good to me.

149
00:18:06.208 --> 00:18:09.709
-You had enough to eat. Mom?
-Honey. I'm stuffed.

150
00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:12.250
Would you get your dad
something to drink. please?

151
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:13.958
Here you go. Pop.

152
00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:16.750
No more pie.

153
00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.042
Well. I'm stuffed.

154
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.584
Can't stop eating.
It's the same every holiday.

155
00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:26.750
Well. you can do it.
You've always been skinny.

156
00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:28.500
Grace likes me lean.
Don't you. baby?

157
00:18:28.583 --> 00:18:30.250
You can starve in January.

158
00:18:31.917 --> 00:18:35.209
What are y'all doing?
Why are y'all here?

159
00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:37.375
This is Frank's house.

160
00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:38.875
It's his house.

161
00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.417
Harry. this is Grace and Jackson's...

162
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.792
No. this is my brother's house.

163
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:46.292
Sweetheart. Frank's not here.

164
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.042
Get out of my brother's house!

165
00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:22.042
Jackson.

166
00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.000
Harry.

167
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.125
Harry!

168
00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.458
Did you find the right size?

169
00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:25.250
Hello.

170
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.750
Hello.

171
00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.834
Is it a baby?

172
00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:39.000
-A baby.
-A boy?

173
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.792
I don't know.
I think. maybe.

174
00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:44.042
It is.

175
00:20:44.792 --> 00:20:45.959
Oh?

176
00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:48.125
Don't leave him to cry.

177
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.583
I won't.

178
00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:55.000
You know. when he comes. he's a cat.

179
00:20:56.042 --> 00:20:58.500
He's a bear and a baby.

180
00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:01.917
And he's you. he's all of you.

181
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.625
He's gonna be so funny.

182
00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:17.292
Hi. Find everything you're looking for?

183
00:23:17.917 --> 00:23:19.042
In life?

184
00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:22.084
Any gas for your car?

185
00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:23.959
-No.
-Alrighty.

186
00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:27.667
I love this stuff. Whatever they put
in that powder. it's like magic.

187
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.959
It's two for six dollars
if you want another.

188
00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:31.375
-I'm good.
-This one's four.

189
00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:33.250
-And the other one is two.
-I get it.

190
00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:35.292
-No. thanks.
-He's a boy. right?

191
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:38.792
He's so cute.
Hi there. handsome.

192
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.708
Hi there. sweetie-pie.

193
00:23:41.708 --> 00:23:43.417
-Does he have a name?
-No.

194
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.375
We decided not to name him.

195
00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:47.417
Oh.

196
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.459
How old are you. sweetie?
Wait. Let me guess.

197
00:23:50.542 --> 00:23:54.417
I'm really good at this.
About six months?

198
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.334
Why are you talking?

199
00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:59.167
Do you ever think about what
you're gonna say or why you're speaking?

200
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.750
Or do you just open your mouth
and blah. blah. blah. blah. blah?

201
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.375
In about 30 seconds. I'll be gone.
We don't need to speak.

202
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.292
Okay.

233
00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:14.417
Got a dog.

234
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:17.792
Look at him.

235
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.667
We need a cat.

Wanna see a magic trick?

247
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:44.583
Stir it up. You stir it up.

248
00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:52.167
Second.

249
00:28:53.583 --> 00:28:54.833
Magic.

250
00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:31.333
Ready? We're ready to steer. Okay.

251
00:30:32.792 --> 00:30:34.958
Ready to drive?

252
00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:37.334
To the moon.

253
00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:43.333
And a left to New York.

254
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:50.334
What is that?

255
00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:51.750
Do you feel that?

256
00:31:04.583 --> 00:31:06.542
<i>Where are you now?</i>

257
00:31:07.333 --> 00:31:10.333
<i>In a burger place
outside of Nampa. 84.</i>

258
00:31:12.167 --> 00:31:14.125
<i>You're eating?</i>

259
00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:15.625
Mm-hmm.

260
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.959
<i>A burger?</i>

261
00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:19.500
<i>Yep.</i>

262
00:31:21.292 --> 00:31:24.125
-Is it good?
<i>-Yeah. it's alright.</i>

263
00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:30.833
Well. what else have you been doing?

264
00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:33.042
<i>Workin'.</i>

265
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:35.042
Uh-huh.

266
00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:36.542
What else?

267
00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:41.209
Is everything alright?

268
00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:45.125
<i>I'm asking you about your day.
This is a conversation.</i>

269
00:31:50.083 --> 00:31:51.333
What have you been up to?

270
00:31:51.917 --> 00:31:53.250
Nothin'.

271
00:31:55.625 --> 00:31:57.333
<i>Have you been writing?</i>

272
00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:01.542
<i>I'll call you when I get closer. okay?</i>

273
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:03.584
Well. are you gonna wanna eat?

274
00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:07.583
<i>Yeah. we can have dinner when I get back.
It's gonna be kind of late. though.</i>

275
00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:10.333
<i>Anything else for you?</i>

276
00:32:11.625 --> 00:32:13.625
<i>What sounds good for supper?</i>

277
00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:16.875
How's the boy?

278
00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:18.417
He's sleeping.

279
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.250
<i>Hey. darlin'.
Here's the check.</i>

280
00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:22.834
<i>Alright. talk later.
Thank you. baby.</i>

281
00:32:22.917 --> 00:32:24.458
Okay. Bye.

282
00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:30.292
Pam?

283
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.583
Pam?

284
00:34:58.792 --> 00:34:59.917
Pam?

285
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.125
Pam?

286
00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:32.292
Fuck! Oh. goddammit.

287
00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:34.000
Pam. what the hell?

288
00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:35.458
You snuck in.

289
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.625
I didn't sneak.

290
00:35:38.792 --> 00:35:40.375
I brought the baby.

291
00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:42.653
-You brought the baby.
-He's asleep.

292
00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.209
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

293
00:35:45.292 --> 00:35:48.167
As long as you don't blow my brains out.

294
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.792
That thing loaded. Pam?

295
00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:52.250
Oh. yeah. It's Harry's.

296
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:54.667
He used to sleep with it next to him.

297
00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:57.375
Made him feel safe.

298
00:36:00.917 --> 00:36:02.625
I don't know
what to do with it now.

299
00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:04.708
I don't know
what to do with any of it.

300
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.708
I never do my hair.

301
00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:12.667
It's pretty.

302
00:36:13.292 --> 00:36:15.000
Harry likes it loose.

303
00:36:15.917 --> 00:36:17.667
Yeah?

304
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:25.000
Are you sleeping at all?

305
00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:27.292
Um...

306
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:28.542
You know.

307
00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:32.333
Jackson says you've been sleepwalking.

308
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.875
Oh. yeah. That.

309
00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:39.583
You get far?

310
00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:43.542
Woke up on Culver Road
screaming my head off.

311
00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:47.125
Never done anything like that before.

312
00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:53.542
Nothing seems real since...

313
00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:57.250
since he died.

314
00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:02.000
My brain just seems...

315
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.042
chopped up.

316
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.917
Yeah.

317
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.292
I'm your grandma.
Yeah. I am.

318
00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:37.208
It's so wonderful the two of you
have taken on the house.

319
00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:40.042
Mm-hmm.

320
00:37:43.167 --> 00:37:45.459
Oh. he was...

321
00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:47.750
such a happy little guy. Frank.

322
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.750
He shot himself?

323
00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:54.000
-Uncle Frank?
-Yes.

324
00:37:54.083 --> 00:37:55.667
And you found him?

325
00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:58.334
I did.

326
00:37:58.417 --> 00:38:02.250
-That must have been awful.
-Yes. I did. It was.

327
00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:06.292
It was.

328
00:38:09.125 --> 00:38:10.333
In the head?

329
00:38:13.417 --> 00:38:14.833
In the head?

330
00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:17.167
No.

331
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.042
-I can't...
-Well. where. then?

332
00:38:23.417 --> 00:38:25.583
The heart? Chest?

333
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.458
No.

334
00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:32.500
-Legs. feet. back?
-No.

335
00:38:32.583 --> 00:38:34.417
-Arms? Stomach?
-No. no.

336
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.333
Dick?

337
00:38:36.917 --> 00:38:38.500
-Grace.
-Ass?

338
00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:43.792
Oh. my God. He shot himself
in his own ass intentionally?

339
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:51.834
You know. he looks just like you.

340
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:55.708
-Uncle Frank?
-No.

341
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.709
The baby. you goose.

342
00:38:57.792 --> 00:38:59.709
Oh.

343
00:38:59.792 --> 00:39:00.959
You think?

344
00:39:01.042 --> 00:39:04.584
Yeah.

345
00:39:09.958 --> 00:39:14.000
Grace. you know. everybody
goes a little loopy the first year.

346
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.333
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

347
00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:22.792
You and Harry have known
each other your whole lives.

348
00:39:22.875 --> 00:39:24.542
Of course you're gonna go
a bit loopy.

349
00:39:24.625 --> 00:39:27.625
No. no. I mean you.

350
00:39:27.708 --> 00:39:29.625
After a baby.

351
00:39:29.708 --> 00:39:32.459
My mother went nuts. Jen lost it.

352
00:39:32.542 --> 00:39:37.459
I didn't feel myself for a while.
But you'll... you'll...

353
00:39:40.958 --> 00:39:42.375
You'll come back.

354
00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:49.333
You know...

355
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.583
-if you're having a hard time...
-I feel fine.

356
00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:58.750
We'll come again soon.

357
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.167
Thanks for the tea.

358
00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:20.000

372
00:44:49.625 --> 00:44:53.084

Why didn't you let him out.
you whack job?

377
00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.417
He's not my problem.

378
00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:08.250
Just put him on his leash.
take him out the back

379
00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:10.292
until he gets used to where he is.

380
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:12.959
Yeah. I'm not gonna train
your fucking dog.

381
00:45:13.042 --> 00:45:14.709
We have a baby.

382
00:45:14.792 --> 00:45:15.917
No shit.

383
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I can't have this...
This place is a fucking hole.

384
00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:21.500
-And you moved us into it.
-I am working.

385
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:24.209
And when I come home.
I'm the one cleaning everything up.

386
00:45:24.292 --> 00:45:27.584
Yeah. three days a week.
Let me shower you in medals.

387
00:45:27.667 --> 00:45:30.875
-Shut up.
-You have an ashtray on the carpet.

388
00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:32.709
You don't think
the baby's eating that shit?

389
00:45:32.792 --> 00:45:34.417
Shut up.

390
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.042
Move us into the house
where your uncle shot himself

391
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:38.375
up the fucking ass.

392
00:45:38.458 --> 00:45:42.125
-Oh. my God.
-Up the ass. Up the fucking ass.

393
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:44.375
-Stop.
-I knew it. I knew it.

394
00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:48.667
Why are your shorts undone?
Why do you not have your shorts on?

395
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.084
-Shut up.
-Jesus Chr...

396
00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:51.875
Fucking sanctimonious dick.

397
00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:54.542
You probably pissed on the floor yourself.
Blamed it on the dog.

398
00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:56.959
It was your mangy dog.
And "sanctimonious" means

399
00:45:57.042 --> 00:45:59.792
you think you're morally
superior to other people. dummy.

400
00:45:59.875 --> 00:46:02.209
-How's the book going. by the way?
-Fantastic. thank you!

401
00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:03.750
Your Great American Novel.

402
00:46:03.833 --> 00:46:07.167
The main character's about to batter
her husband to death with a hammer.

403
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:10.292
-Sounds like shit.
-Well. you can't read. so...

404
00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:13.709
Maybe if I spend a little less time
with my hands down my pants

405
00:46:13.792 --> 00:46:15.584
and a little more time writing.

406
00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:18.959
maybe I'd write something. maybe.

407
00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:20.292
My hands are down my pants

408
00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:23.292
'cause you put your dick everywhere
except there. asshole!

409
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:39.042
-You're gonna wake up the baby.
-Now you're worried about the baby.

410
00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:41.709
I'm always worried
about the fucking baby.

411
00:46:41.792 --> 00:46:42.959
-We're going for a drive.
-No.

412
00:46:43.042 --> 00:46:44.334
-Yes! Yes. we are.
-No!

413
00:46:44.417 --> 00:46:45.709
-Get in. Grace.
-Fuck off.

414
00:46:45.792 --> 00:46:47.584
-We need to talk.
-We can talk here.

415
00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:50.208
-Get in the fucking car!
-Fucking no!

416
00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:52.542
Jackson. I'm not leaving the baby.

417
00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:53.917
Stop. stop. stop.

418
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.584
I'm not leaving the baby.
Jackson!

419
00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:57.875
-The baby's fine.
-Stop! Stop! Stop!

420
00:46:57.958 --> 00:47:00.583
You're a fucking... fucking asshole!

421
00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:04.917
What is wrong with you?

422
00:47:09.542 --> 00:47:11.334
-Seriously?
-Give me the belt.

423
00:47:11.417 --> 00:47:12.917
Oh. my God.

424
00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:17.917
Don't you dare open the door.

425
00:47:23.792 --> 00:47:25.792
Gracie.

426
00:47:35.583 --> 00:47:36.583
Hey. bud. don't...

427
00:47:38.375 --> 00:47:40.833
Stop. Stop!

428
00:47:56.292 --> 00:47:58.375
Look. okay. I... I just think

429
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:02.167
we need to have a schedule
or somethin'. or just...

430
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.667
I just wanna make a plan 'cause I...

431
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.417
Grace. I don't want you to think
that I don't appreciate

432
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.209
everything that you do. I just...

433
00:48:13.292 --> 00:48:18.458
Like. you're the glue.
you're the one. you're the OG. but...

434
00:48:21.042 --> 00:48:23.458
If you're not feeling good. then...

435
00:48:24.708 --> 00:48:27.584
then. I don't know.
maybe we should. like. talk about it.

436
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I just want you to know that I'm here.

437
00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:38.542
Having a baby is like the most...

438
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:42.667
monumental fucking thing and...

439
00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:46.834
I get that. I want you to know
how much I get that.

440
00:48:46.917 --> 00:48:50.125
and if you wanna talk about it. then...

441
00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:52.333
Can we turn this off?

442
00:48:53.042 --> 00:48:54.792
What?

443
00:48:54.875 --> 00:48:57.250
The music. Can we turn it off?

444
00:48:58.292 --> 00:49:00.667
-It's a classic.
-Okay.

445
00:49:02.417 --> 00:49:04.792
I don't care.
I hate it. I hate guitars.

446
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.750
-Since when?
-Since forever.

447
00:49:09.958 --> 00:49:12.292
What? That's insane.
Who hates guitars?

448
00:49:13.542 --> 00:49:14.750
You don't hate guitars.

449
00:49:16.458 --> 00:49:19.209
Grace. I know what you're thinking.
but that's just an old pack.

450
00:49:19.292 --> 00:49:21.709
It's been in there forever.
You've seen them before.

451
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.334
-I've seen these before?
-Yes.

452
00:49:24.417 --> 00:49:27.209
Look. they're just... they're Greg's.

453
00:49:27.292 --> 00:49:31.542
Wow. you and Greg are very. very close.

454
00:49:39.417 --> 00:49:41.000
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

-That neighbour of yours. Melissa?

00:58:48.333 --> 00:58:50.208
She does it over the internet. She...

492
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:53.625
Maybe you could take a class with her?

493
00:58:55.833 --> 00:58:57.584
I don't think that's yoga. Pam.

494
00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:59.834

495
00:58:59.917 --> 00:59:02.250

532
01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:08.500
She took your baby
and disappeared for hours.

533
01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.417
Had you frantic.

534
01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:13.625
And now she's not talking to you?

535
01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:19.625
She just needs some time
to herself. You know. I get that.

536
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.458
No. Jackson.

537
01:02:22.917 --> 01:02:25.125
She is not well.

538
01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.958
Well.
sometimes people aren't well. Mom.

539
01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:33.000
Sometimes people need some time
to adjust when things change.

540
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.334
Sometimes everybody just needs
to have some fucking patience

541
01:02:36.417 --> 01:02:38.625
and trust that things will get better.

542
01:02:40.667 --> 01:02:42.667
Are you still sleepwalking?

543
01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:47.667
I'm just trying to help.

544
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.875
Well. you are helping. Mom.

545
01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:59.542
She just needs some space to... to write.

546
01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.875
She says she can't.

547
01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:07.334
It's just like. you know...

548
01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.667
It's just writer's block
or whatever. I guess.

549
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:12.750
No. I don't wanna get in.

550
01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:18.334
Okay. there we are. Good job.

551
01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:21.084
-Hi.
-Alright. that's a big girl.

552
01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:22.917
That's a big girl.

553
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.458
-I don't wanna go.
-It's okay.

554
01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:28.709
-Sorry to bother you.
-Huh?

555
01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:31.375
I think my car might have a flat tyre.

556
01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:34.334
Would you mind
just taking a look at it?

557
01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:35.625
-Breathe.
-No!

558
01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:38.334
Look at Mommy.
Hey. look at Mommy.

559
01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:41.333
Babe. we don't have any time for this. No.

560
01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:44.250
So...

561
01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:45.750
could you...

562
01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.833
Okay. Yeah. sorry.

563
01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:51.292
Put your leg in the car.

564
01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:00.958
Alright?

565
01:05:08.958 --> 01:05:11.208
When was the last time we had sex?

566
01:05:13.292 --> 01:05:14.917
Rough guess.

567
01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:19.167
I really couldn't say. Gracie.

568
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:22.167
Go on. take a stab.

569
01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:27.334
I don't know. Like a month?

570
01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:29.333
Try two and a half.

571
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.875
Well. things have been. you know.

572
01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:35.500
And it was four in the morning
and you were essentially asleep.

573
01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:36.958
Grace.

574
01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:39.417
And the time before that.

575
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.625
we were watching TV
about that thing on the island.

576
01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:44.250
and I was begging you.
and you put a towel down.

577
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:45.917
Alright. alright. alright.

578
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.250
It used to be good. right?

579
01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:51.167
It's still good. Grace.

580
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:54.375
It doesn't exist. Jackson.
It's not a thing.

581
01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:56.542
Alright. I'm gonna put more effort in.

582
01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:58.167
Tonight?

583
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:00.625
-Okay.
-You want me?

584
01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:02.917
Yeah. I want you.

585
01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.458
Say it again.

586
01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:08.792
I... I want you. yeah.

587
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.834
-Before or after dinner?
-Grace. man.

588
01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:17.667
-Just have a fucking opinion.
-Jesus fucking Christ!

589
01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.542
When we get home?

590
01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.917
Yeah.

591
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.084
You'll fuck me when we get home?

592
01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:30.709
Yeah.

593
01:06:30.792 --> 01:06:32.375
In the car?

594
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.500
If you like.

595
01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.834
We used to fuck in the car
all the time. remember?

596
01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:38.250
Uh-huh.

597
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.542
I'll unbuckle. come over
to your seat and you'll fuck me?

598
01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:43.375
Yes.

599
01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:51.208
Yes.

600
01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:06.292
Come on.
My mom's right there.

601
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:07.875
Fuck me quickly. then.

602
01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.500
I don't...

603
01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:18.334
Grace. come on. I'm just kinda...

604
01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:23.209
You impotent piece of shit.

605
01:07:23.292 --> 01:07:25.333
You useless fucking faggot!

606
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:29.459
You're fucking insane.

607
01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:31.084
Fucking insane.

608
01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:33.250
Everything okay?

609
01:09:02.082 --> 01:09:04.374
-Open the door. I need to use it.
-Piss outside.

610
01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:06.874
I don't need to piss.

611
01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:08.874
Shit in a bush. I don't care.

612
01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:11.792
Oh. God. Grace!

613
01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:14.207
Grace!

614
01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:20.999
I don't wanna shit in a bush.
I wanna shit in the toilet.

615
01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.207
Come on. it's coming out.

616
01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:30.667
Come on.

617
01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:34.125
It's gonna be all over the floor.

618
01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:40.292
I'm starting to smell it.

619
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.249
Quick.

620
01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:44.082
Thank you.

621
01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:50.000
Jesus Christ.

622
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.000
No running. please.

623
01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:17.167
-Hi. Hey! Come on in.
-Hey.

624
01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:19.084
Greg!

625
01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:22.334
Yeah. Greg said we have
enough food to feed a village.

626
01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:25.750
Well. that's what we've got. right?

627
01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:28.125
Well. you can add these. I guess.

628
01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:30.625
They fell over in the car.
They looked better when we got them.

629
01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.209
What happened to your fingers?

630
01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:34.500
I burnt them trying to bake you a cake.

631
01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.875
-Hey. man.
-There you are. Welcome. buddy.

632
01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:38.834
-Good to see you.
-You too. man.

633
01:10:38.917 --> 01:10:40.875
-Hi.
-The place looks great.

634
01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:43.625
He's such a beautiful baby.

635
01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:45.834
-Jack. let's get you a drink.
-Does he want a snack?

636
01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:49.167
-Sure. Whatever the kids are having.
-Okay. No allergies?

637
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:50.625
No. I don't think so.

638
01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:53.750
Who's a sweetie-pie?

639
01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.333
Here's Jack's boy.

640
01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.417
Did you guys see this?

641
01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:16.459
So. you think you'll have another one?

642
01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:19.709
Yeah. Pregnant now.
Cookin' up twins.

643
01:11:19.792 --> 01:11:21.417
What happened to your hands?

644
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.417
Oh.

645
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.667
You should see the wall.

646
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.834
Yeah. I...

647
01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.833
I have two kids. and...

648
01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:35.375
and two is a lot. if I'm being honest.

649
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.959
Seems like it.

650
01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:40.042
Babies. though. babies are hard.

651
01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:41.792
I don't think anybody
talks about that enough.

652
01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:44.167
It's all anyone talks about.

653
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:46.708
It changes you.

654
01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:50.500
I think I nearly lost my mind
for the first six months.

655
01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:53.681
When do you think
you'll be getting it back?

656
01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:02.834
You know. postnatal depression
is so much more common

657
01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:04.292
than people think.

658
01:12:06.792 --> 01:12:09.542
-What do you do for work. Grace?
-I don't.

659
01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:16.417
I'm stuck between wanting to do something
and not wanting to do...

660
01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:19.000
anything at all.

661
01:12:19.083 --> 01:12:23.084
Hang on.
Cheryl mentioned that you're a writer.

662
01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:24.584
That's cute. That must be nice.

663
01:12:24.667 --> 01:12:26.667
Having something you can squeeze
around a baby.

664
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:30.667
-Yeah. I don't do that anymore.
-Why not? Stuck for inspiration?

665
01:12:31.708 --> 01:12:33.250
I'm sure it'll come back.

666
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.125
Grace?

667
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:51.208
Grace!

668
01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.958
Oh. my God!

669
01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:04.667
Jackson? Jackson?
Look at me. okay? Hey.

670
01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:09.084
-Can you breathe?
-Somebody get some water.

671
01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:10.875
-Jackson?
-Let me call someone.

672
01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.750
-What. your chest hurts?
-Yeah.

673
01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:16.292
-You can breathe. Breathe with me.
-I think it's them at the door.

674
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.250
Yeah. See?

675
01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.625
Yeah. you're okay. You're okay.

676
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.417
He's okay.

677
01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:39.292
It's just kind of a wake-up call.
you know.

678
01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:41.708
We need to look out for each other. Grace.

679
01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:48.583
I am getting really stressed.

680
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.167
About what?

681
01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:11.750
No one took our pastries.
You see that?

682
01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:16.458
Well. there was a ton of food.

683
01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:18.959
It's rude.

684
01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:20.875
They weren't being rude.
Come on.

685
01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:23.625
You know what's rude. Grace?

686
01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:27.209
Getting into a pool full of kids
in your fucking underwear.

687
01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:29.292
That's what's rude.

688
01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:30.667
You embarrassed me.

689
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:33.042
You embarrassed us.

690
01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:43.417
Grace. Grace!

691
01:14:44.042 --> 01:14:45.209
Goddammit!

692
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.667
Fuck me. Jesus fucking Christ.

693
01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:54.958
Don't ever do that again.

694
01:14:57.875 --> 01:14:59.625
Alright?

695
01:15:05.917 --> 01:15:07.417
<i>When Amelia was a little girl.</i>

696
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.459
<i>she liked to imagine
she could stretch her wings</i>

697
01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:12.875
<i>and fly like a bird.</i>

698
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:15.417
<i>One day she got to ride on an airplane</i>

699
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.167
<i>and liked it so much
she didn't wanna ever come down.</i>

700
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:21.792
<i>The world looked so small.</i>

701
01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:24.500
the houses and cars were like toys.

702
01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:27.959
They flew for thousands of miles.

703
01:15:28.042 --> 01:15:30.458
Over oceans and jungles.

704
01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:35.834
Some people thought they were crazy.

705
01:15:35.917 --> 01:15:39.833
But Amelia wasn't afraid
of having a thousand adventures.

706
01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:45.209
So she flew on like a bird.
further than anyone had gone before.

707
01:15:45.292 --> 01:15:47.458
never to return.

708
01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:49.959
What the fuck?

709

Kiss me.

-Kiss me.
-Grace.

733
01:23:31.292 --> 01:23:34.000
I don't know where Jackson is.

734
01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:37.292
Let's go find
that no-count husband of yours.

735
01:23:41.167 --> 01:23:42.583
Wow.

736
01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:57.792
Hello.
This is the bride in the bridal suite.

737
01:23:57.875 --> 01:24:01.334
I was wondering if I could get
a bucket of ice sent up to my room.

738
01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:04.417
<i>We've got
an ice machine on your floor</i>

739
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.459
<i>at the end of the corridor there.</i>

740
01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.208
Uh-huh.

741
01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:10.209
What's your name?

742
01:24:10.292 --> 01:24:11.917
<i>Charlie.</i>

743
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:16.167
Charlie. would you mind
getting it for me. please?

744
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:19.084
I'm a little indisposed.

745
01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:22.083
<i>We don't bring up ice. ma'am.</i>

746
01:24:24.667 --> 01:24:26.083
Okay.

747
01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:30.209
Are you still there?

748
01:24:30.292 --> 01:24:33.167
<i>Yes. ma'am. Is there
anything else I can help you with?</i>

749
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:39.584
Well. my husband
is at the party downstairs.

750
01:24:39.667 --> 01:24:41.292
Our wedding.

751
01:24:42.417 --> 01:24:47.292
Um... and I think it would be really nice

752
01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:51.542
if the champagne was cold for him
when we came up.

753
01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:53.333
<i>I understand.</i>

754
01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:56.459
I'm just trying to be a good wife.

755
01:24:56.542 --> 01:25:01.458
<i>Yes. Sorry.
but I can't help with that.</i>

756
01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:06.708
You have a really beautiful voice.
Charlie.

757
01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:08.834
<i>Thank you. ma'am.</i>

758
01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:11.375
<i>♪ The beast in me</i>

759
01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:18.875
<i>♪ Has had to learn to live with pain</i>

760
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.833
<i>♪ And how to shelter from the rain</i>

761
01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:35.209
<i>♪ And in the twinkling of an eye</i>

762
01:25:35.292 --> 01:25:38.958
<i>♪ Might have to be restrained</i>

763
01:25:41.917 --> 01:25:44.208
<i>♪ God help</i>

764
01:25:45.042 --> 01:25:48.125
<i>♪ The beast in me ♪</i>

765
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.708
<i>I must have been about... three?</i>

766
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.667
<i>My parents and I went down to the beach.</i>

767
01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:52.208
<i>They must have been reading.
or maybe they fell asleep.</i>

768
01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:58.917
And I had my feet in the water.
and then this girl came up to me.

769
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.667
She must have been about ten.

770
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:06.458
but to me she seemed. you know.
like a... like a grown-up.

771
01:29:09.375 --> 01:29:13.208
And she took my hand
and we walked for a while.

772
01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:17.833
She bought me an ice pop.

773
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:22.125
People would...

774
01:29:22.833 --> 01:29:24.875
say how cute we were.

775
01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:27.667
It was really nice.

776
01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:35.167
And then as my parents realised
I was missing and...

777
01:29:37.458 --> 01:29:39.708
my mom was crying and...

778
01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.250
my dad was really angry.

779
01:29:42.333 --> 01:29:45.125
and I remember just thinking

780
01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:51.333
"I wish you weren't mine."

781
01:29:53.333 --> 01:29:54.917
"I wish...

782
01:29:56.292 --> 01:29:58.250
I didn't belong to you."

783
01:30:01.042 --> 01:30:03.917
Where are
your parents now. Grace?

784
01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:08.375
They died in a plane crash.

785
01:30:11.292 --> 01:30:12.750
How old were you?

786
01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:14.208
Ten.

787
01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:18.875
It must have been
terribly difficult.

788
01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:26.792
<i>Like. perhaps you have
some abandonment issues.</i>

789
01:30:30.292 --> 01:30:34.458
<i>Which makes it hard for you
to safely attach to people.</i>

790
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.584
Your husband. To your son.

791
01:30:49.667 --> 01:30:52.208
I don't have a problem
attaching to my son.

792
01:30:53.333 --> 01:30:54.958
He's perfect.

793
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.000
It's everything else that's fucked.

794
01:32:15.583 --> 01:32:17.750
Hi!

795
01:32:18.875 --> 01:32:20.875
Hi. baby.

796
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.167
Oh. I missed you.

797
01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:31.125
What?

798
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:35.833
You got a rental?

799
01:32:36.333 --> 01:32:39.667
No. it's ours. I got it off Greg.

800
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:41.917
With what money?

801
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.542
Don't worry about it.
He's taking care of us.

802
01:32:48.667 --> 01:32:49.750
You like it?

803
01:32:51.042 --> 01:32:53.333
Yeah. it's cool. Big.

804
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:09.250
Turn this up. I love this song.

805
01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:14.709
Thought you didn't like guitars.

806
01:33:14.792 --> 01:33:16.958
When did I ever say that?
I love guitars.

807
01:33:24.708 --> 01:33:28.292

He's so cute.

816
01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:21.417
I love his little hat.

817
01:34:22.375 --> 01:34:24.292
He's not really a fan.
Are you. buddy?

818
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:28.167
I babysit a kid just like him.
Yours is cuter. though.

819
01:34:28.833 --> 01:34:30.250
Has he been in the water yet?

820
01:34:30.375 --> 01:34:31.500
No. not yet.

821
01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:34.625
We could take him to
the edge. Do you think he'll go with us?

822
01:34:34.708 --> 01:34:37.667
Yeah. You're very social. aren't you?

823
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:39.708
We can make him a castle if he wants.

824
01:34:40.625 --> 01:34:42.625
If we go just there. we'll be in sight.

825
01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:45.583
Wanna go with 'em. buddy?

826
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:47.917

829
01:34:51.375 --> 01:34:53.792
Come on. Harry.

830
01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:48.442

01:38:02.167 --> 01:38:04.167
<i>What are you sorry about?</i>

836
01:38:06.083 --> 01:38:07.667
