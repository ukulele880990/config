Hey. What's wrong?

3
00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.221
Did you s... see something?

4
00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.889
Let's fucking do this.

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.558
- Let's go!
- No.

6
00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.518
- We're going.
<i>- You're not.</i>

7
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.894
<i>This is so insane.</i>

8
00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.104

they think they are?

9
00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.440
I think there's another way.

10
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.733
Fuck Shauna.

11
00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.402

15
00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.076
Why send me the fucking tape?

16
00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.496
This was all in the note
that I left with the tape.

17
00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.957
I am not the problem.

18
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.459
Shauna is the problem.

19
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.794
I'm just going to the car.

20
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.629

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:56.764

28
00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.271
You don't want to be.

29

30
00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.900

gave you the knife?

38
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.955
- It was Kodi.

39
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.375

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.627

160
00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.048
Yes. Sorry.

161
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.883

162
00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.510

without their knowledge.

163
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:02.011
I don't even have a good excuse.

164
00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:04.055

mom for not wanting me

165
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.223
- to talk to Lottie.
- Right.

166
00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.016
Well. I can't say

167
00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:09.394
that I don't relate
to your rationale.

168
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.062
Thanks?

169
00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.939
I'm curious. did you get

170
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.359
the answers you were
looking for that night or...

171
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.237
right before you killed her?

172
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.075
Okay. I'm sorry.
but that's insane.

173
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.952
- Why would I...?
- That's exactly the question

174
00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:27.954
I'm hoping you can
answer for me today.

175
00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:31.083
Why is this photo of
you on Lottie's phone?

176
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.463
That doesn't prove anything.

177
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.298
Not on its own.

178
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.508
But your DNA does.

179
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:42.177
At first.

180
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.845
I thought it was your mother.

181
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.306
But then she had an alibi.

182
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:49.684
And then I saw the
picture. and I remembered

183
00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:54.314
that mothers and daughters
share mitochondrial DNA...

184
00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:57.693
and apparently
homicidal tendencies.

185
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.946
I swear I didn't
mean to kill her.

186
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.448
It was an accident. I...

187
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.533
You haven't told
anyone. have you?

188
00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:11.915
Let me assure you. you will
feel a whole lot better

189
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.626
once you get this
off your chest.

190
00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:20.049
It all started with that tape.

191
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:26.346
After everything that happened
at Lottie's compound I...

192
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.808
I knew you guys were
keeping secrets.

193
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.310
And then this package
showed up on our doorstep

194
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.812
after Natalie's funeral.

195
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.189
<i>And it was addressed to my mom</i>

196
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.817
<i>but it had that
symbol thing on it.</i>

197
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.486
<i>So I-I took it.</i>

198
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.029
I didn't listen to it.
I didn't even know how

199
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.656
to play it. and then when my mom

200
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.199
kicked Lottie out of the house.

201
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.826
<i>the tape disappeared.</i>

202
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.577
<i>I figured Lottie had
to have taken it.</i>

203
00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:51.871
<i>And she told me
that she was staying</i>

204
00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:53.581
with her dad in the city. so...

205
00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:56.042
<i>I went to find her.</i>

206
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.343
Lottie. hi.

207
00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.972
It's you.

208
00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:16.521
Oh. what the fuck?

209
00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.023
Look. I really only
came because...

210
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:21.360
you-you stole my tape.

211
00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:27.241
Oh. You mean this tape?

212
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:43.339
Callie. you're not
here because of a tape.

213
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.924
You're here because

214
00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:47.219
you want to understand
your mother.

215
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:50.055
Yeah. and?

216
00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:52.725
Truth.

217
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.812
I will tell you
anything you want.

218
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.360
Does she just not love me?

219
00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:06.571
Oh.

220
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.407
My dad says that she has PTSD.

221
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.618
but is it...?

222
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.745
Is that really it? Like.

223
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.955
she does normal mom stuff.

224
00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:18.875
She bugs me about
my grades and...

225
00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.211
she tells me she
loves me. but...

226
00:15:23.213 --> 00:15:25.758
...then I look into
her eyes and...

227
00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.262
...they're just...

228
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:34.642
...they're so cold. it's like...

229
00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.857
It's like looking
straight into the earth.

230
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.485
Well. yeah.

231
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.654
Sort of.

232
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.618
What is that?

233
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.205
Well. you know what it is.

234
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.667
If I did. I wouldn't be asking.

235
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.252
But. Callie. you do.

236
00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:04.671
It's It.

237
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:05.755
You know It.

238
00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.300
You feel It right now.

239
00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:12.136
I could see that the
first moment I met you.

240
00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.639
holding that gun.

241
00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:16.265
And when you drugged Misty.

242
00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:18.435
That was It.

243
00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.146
And your mother. she...

244
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.482
She felt It more strongly
than the rest of us.

245
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.693
And she sees It

246
00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.403
growing in you.

247
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.488
- So. like. adrenaline?
- It's more than that.

248
00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.323
It undergirds everything.

249
00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:33.866
It is the pulse of life.

250
00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:36.202
It's why we did what
we did out there.

251
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:38.371
It's why we couldn't stop.

252
00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.415
You mean eating each other?

253
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.166
And hunting each other.

254
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:46.129
And all of those thrilling.

255
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.507
terrible things.

256
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.051
What's on that tape. Lottie?

257
00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:54.554
It doesn't matter
what was on the tape.

258
00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:55.680
It did its job.

259
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.141

266
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.574

one and the same.

years to tell me

How's the water?
Warm enough yet?

323
00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:26.826
Is there any progress?

324

It's turning on now. I think.

327
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.840
But it just sounds dead.

328
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:43.051

329
00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:47.013

can try again together.

330
00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:49.181

No.

00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:41.401
How?

337
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.863
How could It let this happen?

338
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.951
Maybe It wants us to leave.

339
00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:06.051
We got too arrogant.

340
00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:09.388
It's unhappy with us.

341
00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:12.724
We have to prove
our faithfulness.

342
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.103
It wants blood.

343
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.648
We've done nothing
but spill blood.

344
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.275
Coach. the scientist.

345
00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:25.445
the... the guide.

346
00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:29.907
But they were all our enemies.

347
00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:32.118
Mari. what are
you talking about?

348
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.620
Mari's right.

349
00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:37.373
We haven't offered it ourselves.

350
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:39.458
It's not a real sacrifice

351
00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:41.628
unless we cherish it.

352
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.465
We have to have another hunt.

353
00:23:54.182 --> 00:23:55.558
I agree.

354
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.477
And we have to do
it right this time.

355
00:23:58.478 --> 00:24:01.355
We have to show the
Wilderness our respect.

356
00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:04.985
I'm out. Mm.

357
00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.029
Natalie.

358
00:24:34.055 --> 00:24:36.016
Any other objections?

359
00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:39.978
Good.

360
00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:43.815
We'll draw in the morning.

361
00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:56.494
We're not leaving it
to chance this time.

362
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.206
I thought that was the point.

363
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:03.709
The Wilderness decides.

364
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.211
And It will.

365
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:09.173
but our job is still to
keep each other safe.

366
00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:13.303
which starts with neither
of us drawing that card.

367
00:25:18.558 --> 00:25:20.184
Tai. I can't do that.

368
00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.186
Of course you can. You
did it with Crystal.

369
00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:26.691
For shit bucket duty.
You're asking me...

370
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:32.030
You're asking me
to pick who dies.

371
00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:37.993
These are our friends.
Our teammates.

372
00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:40.372
Not all of them are.

373
00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.959
Okay.

374
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.503
You want me to give
Hannah the queen?

375
00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:48.712
Do you trust her?

376
00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.589
Mm.

377
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.091
Van. she's a stranger.

378
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.009
She's the only person who...

379
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.096
Don't you understand?
This is happening.

380
00:25:57.097 --> 00:26:00.015
If you or I die tomorrow.

381
00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:01.892
are we really gonna be
congratulating ourselves

382
00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:05.271
for having played fair
and followed the rules?

383
00:26:05.272 --> 00:26:07.524
I guess not.

384
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.239
Jeff?

385
00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:20.786
Callie?

386
00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.216
<i>We're sorry.</i>

387
00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:36.051
<i>You have reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>

388
00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:38.804
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

389
00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:49.691
Shauna.

390
00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.285
Oh. my God.

391
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.418
Sh-should I...?

392
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:52.754
You can start.

393
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:21.258
Shauna. what...

394
00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:23.302
You don't need to
take any extra risk.

395
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:26.013
You can go back to your spot.

396
00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:28.348
How'd you get into AP Stats?

397
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:30.476
It doesn't change the odds.

398
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:33.605
Besides. I trust
whatever It wills.

399
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.858
Misty. keep going.

400
00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.725
Oh...

401
00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.018
Tough break. Mar.

402
00:30:18.858 --> 00:30:21.069
Take off your cape.

403
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:42.840
One. two...

404
00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:50.264
- You okay?
- Three...

405
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:53.809
four. five.

406
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.144
six...

407
00:30:56.145 --> 00:30:58.063
You deserve everything
that's coming to you!

408
00:30:58.064 --> 00:30:59.898
Eight...

409
00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:01.859
nine...

410
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.610
ten...

411
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:06.030
eleven. twelve...

412
00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:08.740
thirteen...

413
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:10.368
fourteen...

414
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:13.370
...fifteen...

415
00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.163
sixteen...

416
00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:17.082
seventeen...

417
00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:19.001
eighteen...

418
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:20.419
nineteen...

419
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.420
twenty...

420
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:23.714
twenty-one...

421
00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.549
twenty-two...

422
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.343
twenty-three...

423
00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:29.887
twenty-four...

424
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:31.513
twenty-five...

425
00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:33.307
Hey. Hey. hey.

426
00:31:33.308 --> 00:31:35.058
Get the fuck off of me. Travis.

427
00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.560
If you're not
actually gonna hunt.

428
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.103
then don't get in my way.

429
00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.981
Thirty...

430
00:31:41.649 --> 00:31:43.650
None of this is real. you know.

431
00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:45.111
Seriously. Travis.

432
00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:48.823
You want to make it
two-for-two with your brother?

433
00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.578
Don't you ever wonder
whose reality we're in?

434
00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:56.496
Like. I-I'm pretty sure

435
00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:58.257
that some of my thoughts
are Javi's thoughts.

436
00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:02.044
My favorite thoughts
are Jackie's.

437
00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:04.963
The slumber party make
outs? The jealousy?

438
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:06.590
The betrayal?

439
00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.425
- Back the fuck up.
- It's not him.

440
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.760
It's not him.

441
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.220
Go. hunt.

442
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.307
Go. Hunt.

443
00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:59.977
You should know every
corner of this house

444
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:04.106
is video recorded and saved to
a drive at a remote location.

445
00:33:04.107 --> 00:33:07.234
What did you do to my family?

446
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:09.528
- What?
- They're gone.

447
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.071
They checked out of the hotel.

448
00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:14.241
a-and now n-none of their
stuff is in our house.

449
00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:16.410
And Callie's phone
is disconnected.

450
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.620
And I know that neither
of them would ever know

451
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:19.871
how to contact
the phone company.

452
00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.456
Good for them.

453
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:23.137
I wouldn't have thought
Jeff had it in him.

454
00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:26.128
Please don't tell me
you're blaming yourself.

455
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:28.296
The shock of you taking
responsibility for your actions

456
00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:29.965
just might give me a stroke.

457
00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:31.509
What are you talking about?

458
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.472
Out of all of us. you
had the information

459
00:33:37.473 --> 00:33:40.935
that could've solved Lottie's
murder from the get-go.

460
00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:46.356
You knew she gave
Callie the necklace?

461
00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.401
Yes. And?

462
00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:54.741
Wait a second.
Are you saying...?

463
00:33:55.742 --> 00:33:57.242
What are you saying?

464
00:33:57.243 --> 00:33:59.662
Your daughter murdered Lottie.

465
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.831
It explains the DNA evidence

466
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:05.709
and moreover. she
confessed to it. so...

467
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.462
Wait. she confessed?

468
00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:10.338
She... Like. is she in jail?

469
00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:12.632
No. no.

470
00:34:12.633 --> 00:34:15.969
I strongly recommended against
involving law enforcement.

471
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.929
I did tell her to
talk to her dad.

472
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.598
Yikes.

473
00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:21.308
I guess she did. huh?

474
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:23.602
This was none of your business.

475
00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:26.772
Well. she was desperate for
someone to talk to. and...

476
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:30.567
you were busy eating your
ex-girlfriend's arm. so...

477
00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:33.111
Why would Callie even do this?

478
00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:36.114
If anything. it seems like she
wanted to be Lottie's friend.

479
00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:38.742
It's almost as if
she's been lacking

480
00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:41.870
strong examples in the
friendship department.

481
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.956
Oh. like your besties
have fared any better.

482
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:47.375
You are just as
fucked up as I am.

483
00:34:47.376 --> 00:34:49.087
Maybe you're right.

484
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:53.340
Maybe that's why I didn't
believe Walter when...

485
00:34:54.717 --> 00:34:56.468
Walter knows?

486
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:59.554
No. No.

487
00:34:59.555 --> 00:35:01.598
I figured this
all out on my own.

488
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.935
and you should be
fucking glad I did.

489
00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:07.187
You should go now. Shauna.

490
00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:10.524
As dim a view as I have
of the Wiskayok PD.

491
00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:13.986
I am not above calling them
for a restraining order.

492
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:40.262
Tai. Look.

493
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:41.638
Maybe they're trying
to cut her off

494
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.682
thinking she'll
head for the caves.

495
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:44.975
You go that way.
I'll try this way.

496
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.477
No.

497
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:50.815
Something's weird. Stay close.

498
00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:56.821
This way.

499
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:19.677
Come on.

500
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:38.820
She might've doubled back.

501
00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:40.447
These might not
even be her tracks.

502
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.073
Why would you say that?

503
00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:43.951
I don't know. I'm just saying...

504
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:47.829
What is your problem?

505
00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.915
Maybe you're trying
to let her get away.

506
00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:51.041
What?

507
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.084
Who was supposed
to be the queen?

508
00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:55.046
I know you fucked with the draw.

509
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.923
Do not fucking lie to me. Tai.

510
00:36:57.924 --> 00:36:59.591
If you know what's good for you.

511
00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:02.136
you'll back up.

512
00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:15.523
We're losing time.

513
00:37:15.524 --> 00:37:17.068
Let's get going.

514
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:25.344
Who is it?

515
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:28.638
It's me. Tai. you
need to come quick.

516
00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.349
- Van's hurt. down by the ravine.
- What? How?

517
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.852
It's okay. I think
it's a hurt ankle.

518
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:36.313
But with two of us. we could
take her back to the village.

519
00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:37.814
Okay. I'm gonna go. you can...

520
00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.691
- She's lying.
- What?

521
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:41.443
- Why would I lie about...
- Shauna.

522
00:38:41.444 --> 00:38:42.861
It's a trick.

523
00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:44.529
She wants to separate us.

524
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.864
You're being paranoid.

525
00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:47.366
No. I'm not.

526
00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:50.786
Jesus. then come with us.

527
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:54.122
Fine.

528
00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:55.332
Just go.

529
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.541
Go.

530
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.947
Please...

531
00:39:27.948 --> 00:39:30.033
I'm on your side. I swear.

532
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.744
Of course you are. you're
on everyone's side.

533
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:34.996
If I didn't kill Kodi. Shauna
was gonna kill us both.

534
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:37.499
And that's why you're
following me? For Shauna?

535
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.626
No! I-I... I...

536
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.795
I came out here to study frogs.

537
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:44.756
Instead. my boyfriend
got ax-murdered. I-I...

538
00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:47.425
I stabbed our
guide in the brain.

539
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:49.260
I've eaten human flesh.

540
00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:52.056
I am just trying to
survive. the same as you.

541
00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:56.394
All I want is to
get out of here.

542
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.354
You have to believe me.

543
00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:23.771
I can hear it.

544
00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:25.858
I'm not afraid.

545
00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:31.029
Whatever you need. I
will give you freely.

546
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.823
With every breath...

547
00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.912
...till my breath finally stops.

548
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:47.004
I know how much it must've
hurt to do what you did.

549
00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:52.843
If we want to hunt...

550
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:55.595
...I might have an idea.

551
00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:02.269
No!

552
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:06.815
You made me believe
that I could see things.

553
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:10.193
But Travis told me the truth.

554
00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.070
You did see things.

555
00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:13.696
Your visions came true.

556
00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.657
just like mine.
just like Travis's.

557
00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:19.118
Don't you see? We're
all connected to It.

558
00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:21.372
No. I don't believe that.

559
00:42:24.959 --> 00:42:29.420
I think that this
is all your fault.

560
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:31.882
This place is in us now.

561
00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:35.594
Even if we go home...

562
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.645
...It will come with us.

563
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:23.433
<i>It was just up here. I think.</i>

564
00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.769
The ravine is that way.

565
00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:28.980
Right.

566
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:31.232
Yeah. the snow. I-I just
keep getting turned around.

567
00:43:31.233 --> 00:43:33.277
What are you guys doing?

568
00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.616
- Looking for you.
- Why?

569
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.910
Okay. what the hell is going on?

570
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:44.662
Nothing.

571
00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:46.164
Whoa. what did I miss?

572
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:48.833
Mari's my friend.

573
00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:51.795
I'm just trying to give
her a fighting chance.

574
00:43:52.838 --> 00:43:55.465
She might still get away.

575
00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:39.218
Do you see where we are?

576
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.012
You've been here already. Mari.

577
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:46.057
You could let it be different.

578
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:47.685
Oh. my God! Fuck off!

579
00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:39.235
That's the horn.

580
00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.529
It's over.

581
00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.114
Not for me it isn't.

582
00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:16.939
I knew you'd turn
out to be boring.

583
00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.119
Thank you.

584
00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.582
We all agreed when we came back

585
00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:19.962
that we could keep
the past in the past.

586
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:24.423
That we would
protect one another.

587
00:47:24.424 --> 00:47:27.344
As long as we kept our
secrets. all of us.

588
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.930
And what'd she do?

589
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:32.473
She keeps her
journals in a place

590
00:47:32.474 --> 00:47:34.392
where her husband
can find them. she...

591
00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:38.396
murders her lover.
she mutilated her ex.

592
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.818
It's Shauna's fault
that Van is dead.

593
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.320
Really?

594
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.367
It's her fault that
Natalie is dead. too.

595
00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.744
And don't even get me started

596
00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:55.454
on the shit she
pulled out there.

597
00:47:55.455 --> 00:47:57.081
The worst of what
we went through.

598
00:47:57.082 --> 00:47:59.041
she fueled it.

599
00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.043
She thrived on it.

600
00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.964
I forgot that for
the longest time.

601
00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:07.175
But I can't anymore.

602
00:48:09.511 --> 00:48:11.137
If we keep letting this slide.

603
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:13.974
she's gonna end up being
the last one standing.

604
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.852
And I don't want that.

605
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.479
Do you?

606
00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:22.648
No.

607
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:25.068
I definitively do not.

625
00:50:55.802 --> 00:50:57.888
bring me her hair.

<i>what happened out there.</i>

632
00:53:56.441 --> 00:53:58.275
<i>to understand why it seemed</i>

633
00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:01.237
<i>like I couldn't
remember so much of it.</i>

634
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:03.864
<i>Why none of us could.</i>

635
00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:06.784
<i>I'm finally starting to realize.</i>

636
00:54:06.785 --> 00:54:09.453
<i>we can't remember it
because at some point</i>

637
00:54:09.454 --> 00:54:14.333
<i>we became so alive in
that place that we lost</i>

638
00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:16.544

<i>so horrible. but

642
00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:30.975
<i>or won't remember it clearly
because we recognize.</i>

643
00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:36.106
<i>deep down. that we were
having so much fun.</i>

644
00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:40.150
<i>That's the terrible truth
we left out there. buried.</i>

645
00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:42.946
<i>Along with the people
we called our friends.</i>

646
00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:48.368

<i>I let all of it
slip away from me.</i>

656
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:41.171
<i>It's time to start
taking it back.</i>

657
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.899
Hey. Natalie.

658
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.944
I want to believe that
you had nothing to do

659
00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:49.364
with what happened out there.
but I have my suspicions.

660
00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:54.576
Really?

661
00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.663
You're not gonna say anything?

662
00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:00.792

of a confession?

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.587
