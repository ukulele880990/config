2
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.287
That's him.

3
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:04.916
That's my Tyler.

4
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.086
I'll make the arrangements

5
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.671
for his transfer
back to the U.S.. sir.

6
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.802
All right.

7
00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:18.763
He's good.

8
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.310
-Thanks for coming. Abe.
-Of course.

9
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.108
It's Tyler.

10
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.153
I'm sorry. brother.

11
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.490
They think it was fentanyl.

12
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.536
These fucking cartels.

13
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.038
It's not just
the animals in the city.

14
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.748
They're killing our children.

15
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.751
Yeah. I know.

16
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.337
The DEA is not equipped
to deal with this war.

17
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.883
They've been after this evil
for a long time.

18
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.093
not getting anywhere.

19
00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.263
That's right.
Like I said. it's a war.

20
00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.265
You don't win wars
with slogans.

21
00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.143
Not one more of our children.

22
00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.646
Whatever it takes.
Get it done.

23
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.445
You understand. sir.
This is gonna require an...

24
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.199
unconventional approach.

25
00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.200
I'm good with that.

26
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.497
Let me know if you need
anything to get this going.

27
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.373
Okay.

28
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.210
Go be with your family.

29
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.836
I'll take care of everything.

30
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.972
What's the plan?

31
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.390
We need to scorch the earth.

32
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.893
Take me to the State Prison.

33
00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:47.852
You got a snitch?

34
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.230
I got a devil.

35
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.853
Hey.

36
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.419
Look. man. I just wanna sit here
and read my book in peace.

37
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:23.758
I know who you are. man.

38
00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:25.718
Oh. yeah?

39
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:27.470
Yeah.

40
00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.265
I'm pretty sure you don't.

41
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.266
Why's that?

42
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.353
Look. man.

43
00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.397
I think you got me confused
for somebody else. okay?

44
00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:44.779
I know you're
the fucking Diablo Blanco!

45
00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:51.035
They had you
all over the news in San Diego

46
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.954
after you fucked up
all those homies.

47
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:27.113
You're a dead man.

48
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.322
I know.

49
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.666
Whoo!

50
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:12.963
It's Tracy.

51
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.890
Tracy.

52
00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.266
Listen.

53
00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:31.148
Good. Any issues?

54
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.628
Did you find him?

55
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.556
I see that girl
was looking at you.

56
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.266
Oh. please.
Don't get me started. Lopez.

57
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:07.476
Telling you. chief. that girl
was looking at you hard.

58
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.979
Oh. man. These women look
at a man in uniform.

59
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.398
and no matter how ugly
that man might be.

60
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.859
all they see is
that sexy steady paycheck

61
00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:18.070
and dental insurance
for their wild ass kids.

62
00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.824
Speaking of which.

63
00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.784
did your stepson
get his braces yet?

64
00:12:27.037 --> 00:12:28.456
Lighten up. man.

65
00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.207
I'm sure Carole
wasn't like that.

66
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:34.420
Oh. what the hell?

67
00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:35.921
You'd think these idiots
would know better

68
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.757
than to put this shit
on a cop car.

69
00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.431
What the fuck?

70
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.726
-Oh. fuck.
-You okay. chief?

71
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:49.852
Fenta--

72
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:50.770
Fuck!

73
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.778
Commander 1.
officer needs help.

74
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.238
I need an R.A. at my location
for an opioid overdose.

75
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.657
Possible
fentanyl contamination.

76
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.951
Hang on. chief. stay with me.

77
00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.703
I'm here.

78
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.704
All right.

79
00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:10.664
There you go.

80
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.462
There you go.
There you go.

81
00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:21.967
We need to talk.

82
00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:29.433
Let's skip the
hug and get to the point.

83
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.393
I want you to go undercover

84
00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:35.064
As you can see. I'm a little
tied up for the next few years.

85
00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.691
Besides. I'm out of the game.
Been out for a while.

86
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:40.110
Man. you were.
then you weren't.

87
00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.780
Whether you wanna acknowledge it
or not. you're back in the game.

88
00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:43.989
How so?

89
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.783
You took out a whole cartel.

90
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.243
Mr. Diablo Blanco.

91
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:50.079
That was personal.
You know that.

92
00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:52.289
Oh. I get why you did it.

93
00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.291
Truth be told. I'd...

94
00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.628
I don't think I'd keep myself
from doing the same.

95
00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:59.672
I'm sorry for your loss.

96
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:01.590
You brother Mike was a good guy.

97
00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:06.554
Unlike us.

98
00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.848
Unlike us.

99
00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:14.645
Like I said. I'm out. Abe.

100
00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:17.147
Yeah. Well. I wish
I could let it be. but I can't.

101
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.191
Sure you can.

102
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.986
Stand up. you take your friends
here and you walk away.

103
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:24.238
Too late for that.
You fucked up my op.

104
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:26.115
What op?
Fentanyl.

105
00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.158
Since when does Defense
give a shit about that?

106
00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.119
Since they do.

107
00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:33.205
That shit's killing over
70.000 Americans a year.

108
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.292
It's not a drug.
it's a fucking weapon.

109
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.793
And Mexico is the pipeline

110
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.628
for our enemies
to get it into the streets.

111
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.547
and kill our children.

112
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.548
It's not my problem.

113
00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:43.924
You made it your problem

114
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:45.384
when you took out
our inside man.

115
00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:46.635
Carmelo Aguilera.

116
00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:49.346
I don't know.

117
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.307
Best laid plans
Of Mice and Men.

118
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.600
Go with your plan B.

119
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.894
You fucked that up too.
And plan C.

120
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.733
-Fuck.
-Yeah. Fuck.

121
00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:02.610
You created a power vacuum.

122
00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:05.696
And someone you know intimately
stepped up to the task.

123
00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.156
-Who?
-You know who.

124
00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.949
She still blames you
for killing her boy.

125
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.328
I didn't kill him.

126
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.246
Um-hmm. Tell that to her
when you see her.

127
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.581
Why don't you tell her
for me instead?

128
00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:16.790
I can't find her.

129
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.712
Well. from what I remember.
she's not the shy type.

130
00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:23.339
Silver lining.

131
00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.299
All you have to do
is wait for her to pop up.

132
00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:27.968
Yeah. well.
we don't have the time to wait.

133
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.595
Okay. This is time sensitive.

134
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:34.058
The ambassador
lost his son two nights ago.

135
00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:36.060
We gotta
shut these assholes down.

136
00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:38.062
So now. that it's personal
to some bureaucrat.

137
00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.146
the gloves come off.

138
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.192
Give the ambassador
my condolences.

139
00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.361
Yeah.
I'll give him more than that.

140
00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.405
The war didn't end
when a few soldiers die.

141
00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.366
The real fight is coming.

142
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.910
And we're gonna decide
when and where.

143
00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:55.204
And how do I factor in
to your battle plans?

144
00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.083
You know your old...

145
00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.794
officer pal up in Banning?

146
00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:05.965
He got hit with
a fentanyl laced flyer.

147
00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.508
-He okay?
-Yeah.

148
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:08.884
luckily he had
another officer with him

149
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.469
who had NARCAN training.

150
00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:11.971
Good.

151
00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:13.389
But flyer wasn't for him.

152
00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.058
It was for you.

153
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:23.691
Hailey.

154
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.443
Savannah.

155
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.821
Your sister-in-law
and niece are okay.

156
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:31.490
I moved them up to Oregon
with her parents.

157
00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.158
They're under
protective custody.

158
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.036
Can't keep that forever.

159
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:45.337
What's the job?

160
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:46.630
She is.

161
00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:59.018
I hate to bother you. Tracy.
But we have some good news.

162
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.020
What's the bad news
that comes with it?

163
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.817
The ambassador's son
overdosed on fentanyl.

164
00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:09.695
Fuck.

165
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.656
I told you that fentanyl shit
was gonna be trouble.

166
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.533
These dumbfucks
wouldn't listen.

167
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:17.661
Our operations are clear.

168
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.663
They'll put it on us anyways.

169
00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.415
A bust is a bust.

170
00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.043
It doesn't matter
who put it out.

171
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.295
Now what could possibly be
good enough news to offset that?

172
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.424
I found him.

173
00:17:30.507 --> 00:17:31.216
What?

174
00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.720
Where? Where is he?

175
00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.723
He's in a prison
outside of Puerto Vallarta.

176
00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:39.266
No way.
We have people in the prisons.

177
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:40.601
They would have found him.

178
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:42.644
He was under a fake name.
Tracy.

179
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.315
I want that piece of shit

180
00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.901
to curse the whore of a mother
that birthed him.

181
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:56.075
My Tommy died in a filthy
fucking prison because of him.

182
00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.746
I wanna watch him suffer.

183
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:01.914
We need to get to him.

184
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.044
That's gonna be
a little tiny problem.

185
00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:10.380
-Why?
-They're transferring him.

186
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:11.799
I don't give a shit
if they're shoving him

187
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.259
back up his mother's asshole.

188
00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.304
Tracy. we're talking about
a heavily armored convoy.

189
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:20.557
Some serious weapon
and much more people.

190
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.102
I don't give a shit
if they have tanks.

191
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.979
Consider it done.

192
00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.148
I'll reach out to my friend
and get the weapons.

193
00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.775
And you give me the cash.

194
00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:33.529
Whatever it costs.
Don't fuck this up.

195
00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:48.794
Hey. bro!

196
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:19.783
Ay!

197
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.712
Whoo!

198
00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:07.135
Walk with me.

199
00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:09.156
You aren't
the typical transport team.

200
00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:11.450
You aren't
the typical prisoner.

201
00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:36.660
Copy.

202
00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:41.331
Sir.
they're on the move.

203
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.167
Let the games begin.

204
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:48.255
My men's lives are at stake.
This is not a game.

205
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:51.800
Everything is a game.
You either play or get played.

206
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:54.803
Which. uh...

207
00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:57.180
makes me wonder...

208
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.642
are you trying to play me.
commander?

209
00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.310
-What?
-Are you behind

210
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.604
the fentanyl contamination
in the coke supply?

211
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:05.564
Simple question.

212
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:10.777
Seems to me
it's a great idea for you get us

213
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.406
to come down here and.
uh. clean up your problems.

214
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:17.576
We do the dirty work.
you keep your hands clean.

215
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:20.662
Fucking fantastic idea.

216
00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.872
Absolutely not.

217
00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:24.374
All of our intelligence

218
00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:27.586
points to that gringa.
Tracy. and her crew.

219
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:29.462
I had to ask.

220
00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:31.506
I understand.

221
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.925
Have you tried
these chilaquiles?

222
00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:35.218
Fucking fantastic.

223
00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:38.930
-Mm!
-Hm.

224
00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.623
Don't even think about it.

225
00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:07.542
You're not going
anywhere without me.

226
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.419
Been a while
since I've seen fresh air.

227
00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:14.758
Enjoy it.

228
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.635
There's not much
in the dungeon you're going to.

229
00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.096
Why did you do it?

230
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:25.060
They got in the way.

231
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:27.646
Of what?

232
00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:31.483
Someone from the cartel
murdered a police officer

233
00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.360
up in Banning. California.

234
00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:37.155
I came down
to bring him to justice.

235
00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:39.157
You made yourself
a gringo hunter.

236
00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:42.702
That's a lot of killing
for one arrest.

237
00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:51.086
The policeman was my brother.

238
00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.510
Oh. shit!

239
00:28:32.293 --> 00:28:33.294
They're flanking us!

240
00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:44.305
Samuel!

241
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:48.787
Cover!

242
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:43.109
Hey!

243
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:45.737
Hey!

244
00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:02.605
Sir. we just got word
from the prison.

245
00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:05.191
The convoy hasn't checked in.

246
00:33:05.274 --> 00:33:08.111
-How late are they?
-About 15 minutes.

247
00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:10.154
I'll send units
to check on them.

248
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:11.781
I don't know.
I'm sure they're fine.

249
00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:14.200
Probably rolling slow.

250
00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:17.328
Besides. ahem. you don't know
where to send the units.

251
00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:18.663
We know their route.

252
00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:21.499
-I changed it.
-What?

253
00:33:21.582 --> 00:33:23.126
Operational security.

254
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:26.004
I didn't want anybody
to have

255
00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:27.880
the opportunity
to sell the info.

256
00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:31.217
-What if they're in trouble?
-It'd be fine.

257
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.344
Maybe they're on Highway 200.

258
00:33:33.428 --> 00:33:35.430
Taking the back roads
through Boca de Tomatlán.

259
00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:50.319
Don't move.

260
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:53.489
We're on the same side.

261
00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:54.824
No. we're not.

262
00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:55.992
They killed
our whole team.

263
00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:57.493
They did.

264
00:33:57.577 --> 00:33:58.786
I didn't.

265
00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.706
It was because of you.

266
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:03.750
Yeah. Because of me.

267
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.634
There's a village
a few kilometers up river.

268
00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.094
We're gonna hike there.

269
00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:17.722
We'll find a phone
and call for backup.

270
00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:19.557
Give her your hands.

271
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.683
I can help you fight.

272
00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:24.270
You're my prisoner.

273
00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:26.689
We're all in
the same boat.

274
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:29.192
We need to work together.

275
00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:30.693
They're probably
covering the roads

276
00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:33.362
and have a team tracking us.

277
00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:36.074
Look. I was free. I could have
hit the bush and been gone.

278
00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:51.631
Whatever you're gonna
do. do it quick.

279
00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:53.091
We don't got a lot of time.

280
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.638
Fine.

281
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:01.015
But no guns. You take point.

282
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:02.016
Fine.

283
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:05.436
You probably want this.

284
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.447
Any more surprises?

285
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:17.532
Go.

286
00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:13.332
Small fishing village
like this.

287
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:14.500
probably only has
one cell tower.

288
00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:15.293
Be quiet.

289
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:21.966
Best bet is to find a landline.

290
00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:23.592
I said shut the fuck up!

291
00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:24.719
Look. I'm sorry
about your--

292
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:34.687
If we don't work together.
we're all fucking dead.

293
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.272
Andro.

294
00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:37.565
Let him talk.

295
00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:41.152
All right.

296
00:38:41.235 --> 00:38:43.487
So since you think
you have all the answers...

297
00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:46.198
how do we do that?

298
00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:50.786
Just give them
what they want.

299
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:51.787
You?

300
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:55.124
We're all just bait.

301
00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:56.584
I'm the chum in the water.

302
00:38:58.544 --> 00:39:01.005
If you want us to let you
escape. I don't think so.

303
00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:05.301
The people that are hunting us
are after me. not you.

304
00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:07.178
All you have to do
is hand me over.

305
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:08.971
That's not an option.

306
00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:10.681
You are our responsibility.

307
00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.351
You don't have to get
killed because of me.

308
00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:19.148
-Enough people have died.
-Yeah.

309
00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:21.359
We know who you are.
And who you were.

310
00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:24.695
Then you know
I'd never hurt a cop.

311
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:50.971
At least until
we get out of this shit.

312
00:39:52.598 --> 00:39:54.225
If we get out.

313
00:39:54.308 --> 00:39:57.228
The only way out is to find
their boss and end this.

314
00:39:57.311 --> 00:40:00.314
Who is their boss?
How do we find him?

315
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.941
Her.

316
00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:04.068
It's a woman.

317
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:06.779
She's Mexican American.

318
00:40:06.862 --> 00:40:09.115
And how the hell did she know
you were being transferred?

319
00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:12.034
Someone sold us out.

320
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.869
And if that's so.

321
00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:16.414
she probably has every gun
in this state out for us.

322
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:22.002
Looks like fucking Benghazi
out there.

323
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:25.047
The syndicate has roadblocks on
Highway 200 in and out of Boca.

324
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:26.507
They're checking vehicles.

325
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.050
Well. that's good.

326
00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:29.802
That means they haven't
snatched him up yet.

327
00:40:29.885 --> 00:40:31.720
Any word on my men?

328
00:40:36.058 --> 00:40:39.270
You won't see much in the jungle
from up in the air.

329
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:41.063
I got assets on the ground. too.

330
00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:42.940
We'll locate our target
and get your men out.

331
00:40:43.023 --> 00:40:45.860
How can you be so sure?
My men are the best.

332
00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.654
but they were not ready
to get involved in the war.

333
00:40:48.737 --> 00:40:51.031
They got involved in the war
when they took this job.

334
00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.533
So did you.

335
00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.452
I'm curious.

336
00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:57.329
how did you change the route
if I didn't authorize it?

337
00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:00.207
I made a call.

338
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.377
To who?

339
00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:07.756
Hey. listen. commander.

340
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.467
You wanna say something.
you say it. all right?

341
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.343
Don't fuck around.

342
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:13.721
Are you insinuating that I
would somehow put the lives

343
00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.723
of these brave men
in danger?

344
00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:18.642
What I say
is that it is very irregular.

345
00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.148
I'll tell you
what's irregular.

346
00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:27.276
Are you or are you not
the highest ranking member

347
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:28.903
of your agency
in this area of operation?

348
00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:33.574
Well. then
how on God's holy earth

349
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:36.744
could a foreigner give orders
to your people

350
00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:39.955
to change the route
of a prisoner transport?

351
00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.999
You're either in control
of your troops or you're not.

352
00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:42.917
Which is it?

353
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.169
I am.

354
00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:48.172
Good.

355
00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:51.342
I'm glad you understand.
Conversation is over.

356
00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:39.098
Where the fuck is he?

357
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:41.058
We got him surrounded. Tracy.

358
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:47.773
Don't kill him.
I want to see him.

359
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.778
They knocked out
the cell towers

360
00:42:52.861 --> 00:42:54.780
and cut the landlines
to the area.

361
00:42:54.863 --> 00:42:57.825
NORCOM confirms the target.
Facial recognition is a match.

362
00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.744
All right.

363
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:03.205
The drone tracked her
to this location.

364
00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:05.374
Commander.
I need you to call your troops.

365
00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:07.209
Tell them to stage

366
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:10.129
10 kilometers outside
the town of Boca de Tomatlán.

367
00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:12.673
north and south on Highway 200.

368
00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.592
They stay there
until we get there.

369
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:18.679
Activate the ground assets
in that sector.

370
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.103
You.
Check the high ground.

371
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:30.858
I'm gonna look
for a crossing.

372
00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:31.335
Hey. cover us.

373
00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:51.689
-How is she?
-It went through the leg.

374
00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:08.706
There's probably more.
We need to move.

375
00:45:30.477 --> 00:45:31.687
This way. This way.

376
00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:50.456
We're about
to hit town.

377
00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:52.791
Shit.
We're losing daylight.

378
00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:54.251
We got to take shelter
for the night.

379
00:46:02.676 --> 00:46:03.761
What about this cabin?

380
00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:06.764
I like it.

381
00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:10.601
How you doing
on me. soldier?

382
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.811
I'm good. Keep going.

383
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.230
Oh. fuck.

384
00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:13.205
What's this all about?

385
00:47:15.749 --> 00:47:19.336
The ambush. the American spies
changing our route?

386
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:21.839
You know about that?

387
00:47:23.715 --> 00:47:24.842
It's an open secret.

388
00:47:29.721 --> 00:47:30.848
It's about Fentanyl.

389
00:47:33.058 --> 00:47:35.227
Some Ambassador's son
got a batch of coke

390
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.312
loaded with the shit.

391
00:47:37.396 --> 00:47:39.106
Apparently. the crew
that's trying to kill me

392
00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:40.941
is spiking dope.

393
00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.985
These people are
either stupid or greedy?

394
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.196
You can't make any money

395
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.781
if all the people
taking your product are dead.

396
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:50.868
Yeah. Who knows why
people do what they do?

397
00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:56.957
Maybe she just wants Americans
to feel the way she does...

398
00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:03.297
...and feel the pain
of losing their children.

399
00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:08.844
Sometimes criminals
just do stupid shit.

400
00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:11.054
That's funny.

401
00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:16.768
Americans think that
all Mexicans are criminals.

402
00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:22.441
but you have more people in
prison than any other country.

403
00:48:22.524 --> 00:48:25.360
-I didn't put them there.
-No. you put them in the ground.

404
00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.988
All right.

405
00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:29.907
You put that on me
if it makes you feel better.

406
00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:34.703
I just followed orders
when. where I was told.

407
00:48:34.786 --> 00:48:38.332
Your English. You spent
some time in the States?

408
00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:41.335
Yeah. I grew up over there.
But I was born in Mexico.

409
00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.255
After a while.
I figured the only way

410
00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:47.090
to make my country better
was to come back.

411
00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:53.597
Thank you.

412
00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:58.685
For not abandoning her.

413
00:48:58.769 --> 00:48:59.937
Never leave a man behind.

414
00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:03.565
You could have.

415
00:49:04.733 --> 00:49:06.360
She's not your teammate.

416
00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.947
You. your team.
You could have handed me over.

417
00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.241
But you didn't.

418
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:16.536
No. we're cops.
We took an oath.

419
00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.998
Your brother.

420
00:49:20.082 --> 00:49:21.959
would he have turned someone
over to their certain death?

421
00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:24.878
Not a chance.

422
00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:28.966
He knew the oath. Same as we do.

423
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.389
You're a soldier. right?

424
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.517
Yeah. I was.

425
00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:42.813
And you knew the oath once too.

426
00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.191
Yeah. I did.

427
00:49:49.528 --> 00:49:50.654
Why didn't you become
a policeman

428
00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:51.989
like your older brother?

429
00:49:53.198 --> 00:49:54.157
He was younger.

430
00:49:56.952 --> 00:49:59.496
He wanted to be
in the military. like me.

431
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:00.622
Soldier too?

432
00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:06.169
No. I talked him out of it.

433
00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:12.884
I thought
being a cop would be safer.

434
00:50:32.487 --> 00:50:33.947
Shit.

435
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.115
Contact.

436
00:50:42.581 --> 00:50:43.707
Angelica!

437
00:50:52.966 --> 00:50:54.051
I'll cover our six.

438
00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:08.291
You want me?

439
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:11.044
Let him go!

440
00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:13.213
Okay. What a savior.

441
00:52:22.722 --> 00:52:24.349
I'm giving up! Let him go!

442
00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:38.488
-Samuel!
-No!

443
00:56:31.346 --> 00:56:32.389
Cuervo!

444
00:57:58.433 --> 00:58:00.101
"I want him alive!"

445
00:59:17.303 --> 00:59:19.305
Come out to play!

446
00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.598
I'm not in a playful mood.

447
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:23.810
Really? Too bad. man.

448
00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:26.771
Why don't you take your toys
and go home?

449
00:59:26.854 --> 00:59:30.692
Listen.
it's almost dinner time.

450
00:59:30.775 --> 00:59:33.611
Let's just get this over
before my food gets cold.

451
00:59:33.695 --> 00:59:35.947
All right. step out.
Let's dance.

452
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.824
What?

453
00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.201
This is not an American movie.
my friend.

454
00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:42.453
What's wrong with you people?

455
00:59:42.537 --> 00:59:45.748
You always think
the white guy is the good guy?

456
00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:48.459
Well. I'm not an assassin
working for dope dealers.

457
00:59:48.543 --> 00:59:50.295
So I got that going for me.

458
00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.429
Didn't your mommy teach you
not to fuck with the devil?

459
01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:02.223
You know...

460
01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:07.854
I always enjoy a good smoke
after a fuck.

461
01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.815
Sometimes before too.

462
01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:13.276
Do you want a cigarette
before I give it to you?

463
01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:23.620
What a bitch.
You smoke menthols?

464
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:28.124
You know. man.
In a different situation.

465
01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:30.209
I think
we could have been friends.

466
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.421
Yeah. I don't think
your boss would like that.

467
01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:34.881
Nah. Maybe. but who cares?

468
01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.258
And I think
she's ready to retire.

469
01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:41.054
-You thinking of moving up?
-No. no. no.

470
01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:44.140
I'm not the executive type.
Besides. I love my job.

471
01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:46.726
Yeah. I can see that.

472
01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.645
Can't you see
that you've been played?

473
01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.649
Come on man.
Think about it.

474
01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.484
We find you at the same time

475
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:57.820
that somebody starts
spiking the coca with Fenta.

476
01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.239
I think somebody
is playing us both.

477
01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:03.743
Yeah. how so?

478
01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:06.037
Come here and I'll tell you.

479
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.457
Why don't you come here?
I promise not to shoot.

480
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.125
I think...

481
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.753
I think you're out of bullets.

482
01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:16.422
Fucking try me.
I think you're out of men.

483
01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:41.799
Hey!

484
01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:47.930
You good?

485
01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.641
Yeah. we're fan-fucking-tastic.

486
01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:54.103
-How many rounds you got left?
-We're low.

487
01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.730
All right.
we've got about two minutes

488
01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:57.315
to scavenge body armor
and ammo.

489
01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:58.775
We gotta move.

490
01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:41.651
Hey! Hey!

491
01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:44.821
Yeah. that's me.

492
01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.675
Contact?

493
01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:06.843
I'll cover.

494
01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:22.900
How's the
vacation on the beach?

495
01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:27.238
You set me up?

496
01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.408
Come on. Jake.

497
01:04:30.491 --> 01:04:31.951
That's no way to say hello

498
01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.370
to the best friend
you've got right now.

499
01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:35.162
Of course I did.

500
01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:39.333
What's the ask?

501
01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.377
Straight to business.

502
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.462
You never disappoint. Jake.

503
01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.715
The ferryman. the--
The geezer with the boat.

504
01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:47.967
will help you
get your wounded out.

505
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.177
He'll tell you what's next.

506
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.638
He's also got
a bag of goodies for you.

507
01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.348
Should help keep the noise
down for the neighbors.

508
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.146
I'm me. Jake.
I got eyes everywhere.

509
01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:03.190
Oh. yeah. before you go.

510
01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.735
I just wanted
to tell you something.

511
01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:07.111
You're still my favorite.

512
01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:09.947
Yeah. well. fuck you too.

513
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.039
All right. boys. settle in.

514
01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:20.333
And what we'll do now
is wait out till night.

515
01:05:23.544 --> 01:05:26.505
You two dial for backup.
I got something I need to do.

516
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.717
You're not gonna get rid of me.

517
01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:41.938
You'll drop me off
at the target?

518
01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.230
Yes.

519
01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:45.107
And get these two out of here?

520
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.238
I need you to go back.

521
01:07:17.491 --> 01:07:18.826
I'm going in.

522
01:07:18.909 --> 01:07:20.911
You don't understand.

523
01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.873
This road we're on.
I've been down it.

524
01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:25.875
I already threw
my life away.

525
01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:27.877
You don't need to end up
in a cellblock next to me

526
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.045
or in the ground.

527
01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:32.089
They killed
my best friend.

528
01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:36.635
He asked me to be
his son's godfather.

529
01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.179
Would you walk away?

530
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:08.829
-This is a graveyard.
-I fucking knew it.

531
01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:12.958
Come on in. boys. Come on.

532
01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:16.629
That motherfucker
killed my Tommy!

533
01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.964
Will you shut this bitch up?

534
01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:22.092
Listen.

535
01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:23.260
What the fuck?

536
01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:30.434
I told you how many times
to keep that shit on the street.

537
01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.520
And you wouldn't do it.

538
01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:35.397
Now. was that
because of greed

539
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.900
or was that just
a fuck you to me?

540
01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:39.735
Fuck you!

541
01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:40.611
Oh. Lordy.

542
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:51.080
Yeah.
What took you guys so long?

543
01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:55.251
Ahh. I can't believe you
let me beat you to the prize.

544
01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:59.255
I said put your weapons down.
all right?

545
01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.134
Diaz.

546
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.644
Come on. Jake.
Don't look so surprised.

547
01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:17.356
Yeah. I'm a bit confused.
Why'd you kill her?

548
01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:19.650
Uh...

549
01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:22.194
Because she wouldn't
shut the fuck up.

550
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.154
I mean. the venom
that was spewing from her mouth.

551
01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.323
it was just foul. okay?

552
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.325
She kind of reminded me
of my mother.

553
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.369
Yeah. well. I'm sorry to
break up your family reunion.

554
01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.288
but why'd you need us?

555
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:37.251
You were a great distraction
for our flanking maneuver.

556
01:11:37.334 --> 01:11:39.253
So you used us?

557
01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:42.131
Everyone uses everybody.
Calm down.

558
01:11:42.214 --> 01:11:43.966
So what?

559
01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:46.719
You inheriting
this dope racket?

560
01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.387
Well. I gotta
make a few moves first.

561
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:51.140
but uh.
then I'll shut it down.

562
01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:53.767
By what? Selling dope?

563
01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:56.979
See. this bitch here
was trying to keep fentanyl

564
01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:58.439
out of the dope stream.

565
01:11:58.522 --> 01:12:00.399
I thought
that's what you wanted.

566
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.067
Fuck no.

567
01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.362
It's the best thing
since sliced bread.

568
01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.406
Soon as people
started popping off

569
01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.616
from using
fentanyl-laced cocaine.

570
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.786
cocaine use dropped
in America by...

571
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.246
What was it?

572
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.540
-Sixty-two percent. sir.
-Sixty-two percent.

573
01:12:16.623 --> 01:12:19.001
That's fucking outstanding.

574
01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:20.919
Then these dirtbags.

575
01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.881
they kill each other over
whatever market share is left.

576
01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.801
What about legitimate addicts?

577
01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.928
They die.

578
01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.806
One way or another.
they stop buying dope.

579
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.683
And that's how we win the war.

580
01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.977
What will your supervisors
think about that?

581
01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.814
They'll say
I made America great again.

582
01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.153
Clavo.

583
01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:49.365
Pato.

584
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:02.586
Andro. we need one good man
to survive this.

585
01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:08.509
We all good?

586
01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:10.386
-What if we're not good?
-We're-- We're good.

587
01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.763
I'd take his advice.

588
01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:15.849
There's only one way this ends.
and that's my way.

589
01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.727
Let's get the fuck out of here
before the flies set in.

590
01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.860
I promise you.
we'll finish this.

591
01:14:31.383 --> 01:14:32.468
Okay.

592
01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:07.961
You good?

593
01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:09.338
I'm okay.

594
01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:10.589
Oh. come on now. Jake.

595
01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:13.759
You know me.
I'd never hurt a lady.

596
01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.969
You should ask Tracy that.

597
01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.846
I said "lady."

598
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:18.805
Was that the intel?

599
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:24.561
Oh. that's how
it's gonna be. huh?

600
01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:37.282
That's my boy.

601
01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:41.995
Give me that.

602
01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.540
Here's the locations
of our recently acquired labs.

603
01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:47.084
All right.
I'll take care of these.

604
01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:51.338
You know. it's been so damn good
catching up with you. Abe.

605
01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:52.881
-Really?
-I missed you.

606
01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.633
Appreciate that.
I miss you too. sweety.

607
01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:55.759
We'll have to
do it again.

608
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:01.598
What's the line on Nando?

609
01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:03.600
Colombia.

610
01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:06.728
I'll take care
of transportation.

611
01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.065
Nice work
taking out my overwatch.

612
01:16:10.148 --> 01:16:12.067
Very impressive.

613
01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:13.652
Got to stay a step ahead.

614
01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.446
Next time. try four.

615
01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.110
You want to say hello?

616
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.280
Let them know
you're all right?

617
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.657
Uh...

618
01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:02.659
Better if I don't.

619
01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.624
So you pick a new name?

620
01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.628
I like Gustavo.

621
01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.506
Gustavo?

622
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.676
Yeah. yeah.
I can pull off a Gus.

623
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.095
Gus. yes. Gustavo?

624
01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.104
You know I
got your back out there.

625
01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:36.652
Thought your brother might
want you to have one of these.

626
01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:40.989
Saint Michael?

627
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:42.908
Just in case.

628
01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:49.081
You know. all this corruption.
all this killing is...

629
01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.918
you and I.

630
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:56.505
we're in a position now.
maybe we can change it.

631
01:17:56.588 --> 01:17:59.549
But it's probably
gonna get messy.

632
01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.177
I can do messy.

633
01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:10.829
IN LOVING MEMORY OF
JUAN MIGUEL HERNANDEZ DOMINGUEZ
