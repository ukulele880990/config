<i>The easiest way to win a game</i>

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.339
<i>is to make your opponent</i>

3
00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:08.300
think they're playing
a different game entirely.

4
00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.011
The only crime I'm guilty of
is being an embarrassing nepo baby

5
00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.847
- who's trying to do some good.
- Yeah. how's that going?

6
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.100
I wanna prove to everyone
that I'm not a... fuck-up.

7
00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.603
Jay didn't do it.
He's sweeter than I expected.

8
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.356
That lying piece of shit.
This isn't his finger.

9
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.857
Enjoy the remodel.

10
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.859
She's a home decor witch!

11
00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:27.402
What's Mayor Tillman doing here?

12
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:28.987
How is the pod? Right?

13
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.698
I'm... Hey. I'm still avail to guest. FYI.

14
00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.951
I'm collecting signatures
to stop New York City

15
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.953
from opening its first ever casino.

16
00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.579
I got an offer on my place.

17
00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:38.914
It's big.

18
00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:42.000
I. uh. joined a dating service
for sexy seniors.

19
00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:43.502
It's called. uh. Last Gasp.

20
00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.421
Oh! Last Gasp notification.

21
00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:49.049
- Priscilla. she's so funny.
- You told her about the case?

22
00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.968
Just a... a little tidbit.

23
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.344
You're being catfished. Charles.

24
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.347
This glitch is from the same footage
as THĒ and Seth Rogen's.

25
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.725
- Something has been cut out.
- Why is the Last Gasp peach logo

26
00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.019
the same as on the security footage?

27
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.563
That's who's been messaging me?

28
00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:06.567
- And cooked the footage.
- And maybe killed Lester.

29
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.694
What does it say?

30
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.405
<i>You're such a smarty-pants.</i>

31
00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.907
<i>Now I need to come hunt you down.</i>

32
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.831
<i>When you live as a titan of industry</i>

33
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.792
<i>on this planet amid the metropoleis...</i>

34
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.798
<i>nothing means more than getting away.</i>

35
00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:36.305
<i>To think. to play. or just... escape.</i>

36
00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.808
You think he knows
he's goin' to the vet?

37
00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.894
Well. if he didn't. he does now.

38
00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:44.688
Oh.

39
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.483
Ooh. it's one of those "Silver Alerts."
Always so sad

40
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.193
- when an old person goes missing.
- Aw.

41
00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:54.906
It says. "Endangered adult male.
74. 5'7". brunette.

42
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.617
"last seen wearing
southwestern cowboy boots

43
00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.453
- and a purple scarf."
- Oh! Thank God!

44
00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.872
Did it say the boots were turquoise?

45
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.623
Oh. thank God!

46
00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:04.875
Thank God.

47
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.752
You gotta save me.

48
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.129
I'm in danger.

49
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.673
<i>You hear it all the time.</i>

50
00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:14.468
<i>"The bigger the risk.
the bigger the reward."</i>

51
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.263
<i>But when it comes down to it. most people
aren't willing to take the leap.</i>

52
00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:20.557
<i>What the very successful know</i>

53
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.353
<i>is that you have to take bold risks
to strike gold.</i>

54
00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:29.107
<i>So. tell me. are you willing
to go all in for greatness?</i>

55
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.693
<i>- I said. are you willing?</i>
- Yes!

56
00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.822
Sorry.
I know he is our murder suspect.

57
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:39.034
But the "Bash Steed Greatness Academy"
audio tapes

58
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.078
are really inspiring.

59
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.954
That was $18 well spent.

60
00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:47.459
If only he let it slip where to find him.
then <i>I'd</i> be all in.

61
00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.336
Oh. wait a minute.
this might be something.

62
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.420
- What?
- Oh. No.

63
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:54.800
His company website says.
"Bash Steed is a citizen of the universe

64
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.135
"with a home in each of the continents

65
00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.138
- and a bio module on Mars."
- Wow. Wow.

66
00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:03.058
He's also an asshole. pardon my French.

67
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.935
I mean. he did pretend
to be my girlfriend.

68
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.604
Mm. not exactly sure you can call
Priscilla a girlfriend

69
00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:10.607
when you messaged for six hours
and you've never met in person.

70
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.776
Oh. how embarrassing.

71
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.029
Someone doesn't know
the term "situationship."

72
00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:19.282
Okay. will you two Muppets
stop arguing?

73
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.285
We need to prepare
for our interview with the mayor.

74
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.829
Fine. I'm over it anyway.

75
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.414
Although I still don't know
why we're podcasting

76
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.749
if we're not allowed
to talk about our suspects.

77
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:31.044
That's because
we are contractually obligated

78
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:33.463
to make content for Wondify.

79
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.551
- This is so dumb.
- No. no. no. um. I think interviews

80
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.803
are an evolution of our brand.

81
00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.973
And having the mayor
as our first guest is quite the get.

82
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.975
I've already reached out
to Meghan Markle's team

83
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.601
about being guest number two.

84
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.729
Okay. that must be him... Oh!

85
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.398
Did you see the email from Wondify?

86
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.608
They want us to be
more like the Drunken Sluts.

87
00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.570
You know. so they want us to slut it up!

88
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.197
Ho-ho! Ho!

89
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:00.282
Jesus.

90
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.786
- Greetings. Ho-ho!
- Hey!

91
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.621
Mayor Tillman in the house.

92
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.165
How are you. Charles?

93
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.792
Oh. my goodness.

94
00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.961
- Hello. What a pleasure.
- Hello. how are you?

95
00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.880
- Thank you. Thank you.
- A pleasure. Big fan.

96
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:19.176
Thank you.
Oh. I can't believe I'm here. finally.

97
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.179
Wasn't sure how many overtures
I was gonna have to make

98
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.432
before you would finally take the hint
and let me on the pod.

99
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.683
Oh. no. no.

100
00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.934
But fear not. fear not.

101
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.229
I have been working
on my podcast voice for months.

102
00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.564
Check it out.

103
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.150
I am Michael Barbaro.

104
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.568
Uh-huh?

105
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:37.694
Oh. no. that's it.

106
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.029
- Oh!
- Oh.

107
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.240
- That was so good.
- Oh. well. let's just get this started.

108
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:43.325
Alright.

109
00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.744
Okay!

110
00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.622
Oliver and Mabel.
we got a really special edition

111
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.624
of <i>Only Murders</i> podcast today.

112
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.335
We're sitting with
New York City Mayor Beau Tillman!

113
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:55.962
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

114
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.381
Thank you very much. Charles.
Uh. a huge fan.

115
00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.758
- Ohh!
- Yeah.

116
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.927
Uh. you know.
a big part of my platform

117
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.554
is making the streets of this city safer.

118
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.057
so I am excited to chop it up today.

119
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.477
Well. uh. great. So the first
and most obvious. uh. question is...

120
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.062
- Mm-hmm?
- ...what are you gonna do about

121
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.523
the crosswalk button on 86th and Broadway?

122
00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.192
Oh. uh. is... is it broken?

123
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.319
No. but the button gets a little sticky.

124
00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.488
and sometimes it... it's...
it's difficult to tell

125
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.198
if you've pushed it or not.

126
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.536
You said you wanted to make
the streets safer.

127
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.246
Oh. I meant from murder.

128
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.081
- Ha! Of course.
- Yeah. so... yeah.

129
00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.543
'Cause I... I heard your teaser trailer
a while back. then crickets.

130
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.545
So. I have some theories.

131
00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.839
Have we looked into the person

132
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.967
who is running against me this fall?

133
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.760
Right?

134
00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.762
- You guys see?
- Oh! It's a joke.

135
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.306
- Joking.
- No. No. no. no. no.

136
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.809
We cannot podcast about that murder.

137
00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:54.145
- What...?
- Because. well. our prime suspects

138
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.732
bought our network and banned us
from talking about them.

139
00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:01.027
Oh. the Wondify sale. Yeah.

140
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.863
Wait.

141
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.782
Is Bash Steed one of your suspects?

142
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.492
Yeah. you know him?

143
00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.120
Uh. love him.
I... I... I would be shocked

144
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.122
if he was related to your case.

145
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.959
Actually. um. you know. Romy.
I... I could really use a coffee

146
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.253
- from that bodega on 74th.
- Okay.

147
00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.632
Okay. thank you.

148
00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.636
Bash Steed is your murderer.

<i>We have to be quick.</i>

151
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.816
Romy is Bash's niece.

152
00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.820
He had me hire her so he could
keep eyes on me all the time.

153
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.365
And yes. she also happens
to be the best assistant I've ever had.

154
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.700
You should see how fast
she gets coffee.

155
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.160
Like a Road Runner cartoon.

156
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.954
She's already in the courtyard.

157
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:39.417
Well. then. uh. start talking.
What makes you think Bash is our suspect?

158
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.960
Well. I... I don't actually
know that for sure.

159
00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.045
Dammit. Mayor!

160
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.880
But if you are investigating him
for something.

161
00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.508
chances are. he did that something.
Trust me.

162
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.968
This man will do
whatever it takes to get ahead.

163
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.554
He has paid millions into my campaign.

164
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.015
So. why are you trying to out him?

165
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.642
When I was first running for office.

166
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.560
I was up against people
with deep pockets.

167
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.106
I didn't stand a chance.
until Bash opened up his checkbook.

168
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.442
But it turns out. if people
give you money. you owe them later.

169
00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.569
Been there.
One time. I took a small loan

170
00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.488
- from Robert Blake. He was...
- Oliver!

171
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.115
Uh. s... Real quick.

172
00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.243
He made me lie under oath.
Continue. please.

173
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.954
Uh. okay.
Well. uh. it started out small.

174
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.082
Uh. building permits.
diplomatic license plates.

175
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.792
But then the asks kept getting bigger.

176
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.670
Now. I'm spending so much time
doing his bidding.

177
00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.589
I haven't made good
on any of my campaign promises.

178
00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.591
That's why I wanted to do your podcast.

179
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.885
so I could win over the public
and stop simping

180
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.971
for some lunatic billionaire.

181
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:36.349
Why don't you do something about it?
Talk to the chief of police.

182
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.519
Who do you think
is the NYPD's biggest donor?

183
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.521
He's literally above the law.

184
00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.982
I'll bet Bash hired those dirty cops

185
00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.192
I saw over Nicky's body
at the dry cleaners.

186
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.319
Don't doubt it. And meanwhile...

187
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.155
I'm powerless.

188
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.781
Nothing but a puppet.

189
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.117
My ass is sore from having
his hand so far up there.

190
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.660
And not in a fun way.

191
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.371
Great. so if the mayor of New York
has no power.

192
00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.831
what the hell are we supposed to do?

193
00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.499
Investigate.

194
00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.377
I-If you find something.
maybe we can take Bash down together.

195
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.297
Oh. my God. that would be
amazing for my numbers.

196
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.799
City people <i>hate</i> billionaires right now.

197
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.093
We're trying.
but we can't even find him.

198
00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.721
Well. the other day.
I overheard Romy on the phone.

199
00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:18.516
Apparently. he's hosting
some big. secret rich people meeting.

200
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.312
Let me guess.
With Camila White and Jay Pflug?

201
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:26.107
Yep. at his country estate
in the middle of nowhere.

202
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.610
no servants. no service. no witnesses.

203
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.945
I'm not saying
that they're doing blood rituals.

204
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.530
but I have heard rumors
that it's exactly that.

205
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.157
Yes.

206
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.533
Do you have an address?

207
00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.410
Yes. the address.
so we can never go there.

208
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.622
Oliver. maybe by surprising him.

209
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.624
we can find something to take him down.

210
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.585
Yes. and if we end up dead.
the mayor can just get Bash on that.

211
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:46.669
Oh. Smart.

212
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.464
Oh. I mean. as a backup plan.

213
00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.840
What backup plan?

214
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.383
Oh. Romy!

215
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.761
Hey. Yeah. we were. uh.

216
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.721
just talking about. um. birth control.

217
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.848
- Yeah.
- Morning-after pill.

218
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.600
Yeah. I need it.

219
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.102
Feminism.

220
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.646
You know. the...
The right to choose-a-roni.

221
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.231
We should go.

222
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.233
Ribbon cutting
at the New York City Ballet.

223
00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.943
God. snooze.

224
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.611
Sarah Jessica Parker's gonna be there.

225
00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:13.696
- She's friends with my uncle.
- And wide awake!

226
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.657
Let's go. Thank you.

227
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.367
Uh. sorry for the chicken scratch.

228
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.161
If I get reelected. first thing
I'm gonna do is fix the public schools.

229
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:27.043
Do either of you see how insane this is?

230
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.963
We're about to face off
with the most dangerous suspect

231
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.048
we've ever had... in the wilderness.

232
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.093
- Oliver. we're going to Connecticut.
- Yeah. well. Putnams don't do foliage.

233
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.096
In fact. I... I should probably stay home
and text my poor wife

234
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:41.099
who's on hour 18 of her United delay.

235
00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:44.185
She's boarded and deboarded
four separate times

236
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.396
and spent $900 at Hudson News.

237
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:50.191
Well. I for one. am going in
scorched earth. guns blazing.

238
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.235
hell hath no fury like a Savage scorned.

239
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.737
Come on. Oliver. I know
you wanna take those cowboy boots

240
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.739
out for a spin in the country.

241
00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.909
- Didn't you get those from Wonder Woman?
- Linda Lavin.

242
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.202
- Ah.
- Do they come in a men's?

243
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.537
They're unisex!

244
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.664
And a piece of Broadway history.

245
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:07.417
She wore them in
<i>Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.</i>

246
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.254
And in a private viewing.
only the boots.

247
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.882
- Ew.
- But that's beside the point.

248
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.092
This is crazy. and I'm not going.

249
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.052
We have to. for Lester.

250
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.932
And if it gets all <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>
then we can leave.

251
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.145
Alright. I'll go.

252
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.479
For the boots.

253
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.733
And I'm sending my wife
a cute little selfie of me in them.

254
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.985
so she can ID my body!

255
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.740
He's gotta relax.
How scary can a country house be?

256
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.205
Bash's den of lies.

257
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.960
I wonder what room he was in
when he first posed as Priscilla

258
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.922
with the conniving line.
"I really like your profile.

259
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:57.008
If you could add one color
to the rainbow. what would it be?"

260
00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.469
- What'd you answer?
- Brown.

261
00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.890
Well. the landscape is very... lush.

262
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.684
Yeah. that's what happens
when you fertilize with human remains.

263
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.898
Oh. great!
We... We lost service a mile back.

264
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.317
Now. Loretta's gonna think
that I'm in danger.

265
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.986
And newsflash. I am!

266
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.447
Oliver. calm down.

267
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.617
There's nothing to worry about.
Just don't look to your three o'clock.

268
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.206
Do we think he's real.
or are we gonna find out

269
00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.041
he died 50 years ago in a fire?

270
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.629
I like your skin.

271
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:35.713
Ah.

272
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.926
That's the first compliment
that ever made my bowels evacuate.

273
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.803
Hi.

274
00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.097
Uh. i-is your dad home?

275
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.182
Or maybe he's your grandpa?

276
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.517
Or son.

277
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.769
If that's the plot twist
of this horror movie.

278
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:54.065
He's inside with the others.

279
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:58.069
But Daddy says little boys who interrupt
get sent to the cellar.

280
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.655
Okay.

281
00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:02.031
Well. thank you.

282
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.702
And you know. good luck
with your... shiv.

283
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.549
Okay. I... I've seen enough.

284
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.884
How 'bout we beat traffic.
avoid getting hunted.

285
00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.095
- and hung on a wall?
- Shh.

286
00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.974
Listen.

287
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:35.940
First. I'll remove the spleen.

288
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.608
Careful.

289
00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.320
They're harvesting organs
to sell on the black market.

290
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.991
Next. I'll take the kidney.

291
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.249
Dammit!

292
00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:55.585
It's always the wishbone.

293
00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.920
They're playing...

294
00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.213
<i>Operation?</i>

295
00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:03.468
<i>♪ The leg bone's
connected to the hip bone ♪</i>

296
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.970
Well. just three adults
playing a children's game.

297
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.722
Not at all creepy.

298
00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:08.973
I'm good to go.

299
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.937
Hi!

300
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.856
Trespassers.

301
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.693
Naughty. naughty.

302
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.911
You said today would be private.
What are they doing here?

303
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:33.039
Better question.
what are <i>you</i> doing here?

304
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:36.876
Playing board games
in the privacy of my own home.

305
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.169
Oh. please.

306
00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:40.630
We know what happens
when the three of you get together.

307
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.007
Even if it looks like a game of <i>Operation.</i>

308
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.301
we know you're always
playing for something.

309
00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.971
Might as well show them.

310
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.692
Okay. a trophy from Walgreens?

311
00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:05.154
Well. there were only so many times
we could destroy each other's businesses

312
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.989
before it got boring.

313
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.200
so we started having game nights.

314
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.869
Gives us an outlet
for ruthless competition.

315
00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.246
And gossip.

316
00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.623
Warren Buffet shaves his bikini line.

317
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:18.334
- Oh!
- Oh! What?

318
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.877
Okay. fine.

319
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.839
Well. if that's all you guys are doing.

320
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:26.509
I'm sure you wouldn't mind if we stayed
and watched a little. right?

321
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.720
No. no. no. I... I think...
I think we've overstayed our welcome.

322
00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:30.847
Nonsense.

323
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.849
Please stay.

324
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:33.933
I insist.

325
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.404
Yahtzee!

326
00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.906
Well. that wraps up round seven.

327
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.117
Maybe they really are
just playing board games?

328
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.203
No. no. No. no. no.
I'm telling you. these people are killers.

329
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.956
They played <i>Monopoly</i> start to finish
and no one flipped the board over.

330
00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.082
Sociopathic.

331
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.334
Now. please excuse me.

332
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.503
I have business to attend to.

333
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.677
I'll follow him.
Maybe I can get him to talk to me.

334
00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:18.144
Okay. I'm on Pflug duty.
Oliver. you're on Camila.

335
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.188
Whatever happened.
the three of them

336
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:22.315
are clearly in on it together.

337
00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:23.399
Oh. yes.

338
00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:35.536
So. um. how does gaming here
compare to gaming at The Arconia?

339
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.750
How's your apartment. Oliver?

340
00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:45.504
My apartment?
Well. um...

341
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:50.301
I was thinking of selling.
Uh. got an insanely good offer.

342
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.552
Oh.

343
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.182
What. that's all you have
to say to me about it?

344
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.851
Should there be more?

345
00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.229
How about. um. mm-mm...

346
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.481
"Thank you"?

347
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:08.277
I transformed your sad. purple hovel

348
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.446
into a camel-toned fantasy land.

349
00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.032
I said "camel-toned."

350
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:16.244
When I met you. you had
zero tassels on your pillows.

351
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:19.664
And now. look at you.
Tassel King of the Upper West Side.

352
00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:20.873
all because of me.

353
00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.750
The disrespect.

354
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:26.462
I should cut off your balls
and shave them into a potpourri.

355
00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:32.468
Sorry. I downed an entire bottle
of Chablis on the 'copter over.

356
00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.596
You have a question for me?

357
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.223
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. mm.

358
00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:38.307
Okay.

359
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.993
You followed me all the way out here.

360
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.497
Do you have something to say?

361
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.709
I was sort of waiting
till you put down the big blade.

362
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.879
This is a skin tree.

363
00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.967
The bark helps
with my Algernon's digestion.

364
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:15.678
Oh. look.

365
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.347
There's Algie in the pool.

366
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.227
How fun.

367
00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:29.275
I was going to cover the pool up.
but Algie loves to swim.

368
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.697
Now. when my other children were young.

369
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.951
I was too busy building my empire
to be a good daddy.

370
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:43.414
So. with Algie. I promised
to never miss a single bedtime.

371
00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.041
and I never have.

372
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.545
Don't try to be sympathetic. <i>Priscilla.</i>

373
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:52.757
You catfished me.

374
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:57.553
You preyed on a buffed-up.
albeit older. romantic looking for love.

375
00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:01.307
but I guess that behavior
is to be expected from a murderer.

376
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.522
I am not a murderer.

377
00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:09.940
I hate death.

378
00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.486
I lost my papa
when I was very young.

379
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.447
That's what sparked
my fascination with longevity.

380
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.535
You know. the micro-naps.
cryo-chamber. stem-cell shakes.

381
00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.246
Everyone thinks it's born out of vanity.

382
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:31.128
But the truth is. I want my Algie
to keep his papa...

383
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:33.923
...possibly forever.

384
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:39.178
Father. is it time
for my <i>gesunde Leckerei?</i>

385
00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.514
My boy.

386
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.808
He loves his healthy treat.

387
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.267
Now. if you'll excuse me.

388
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.602
Oh. Charles.

389
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.438
I wish you nothing but happiness.

390
00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.620
Looking for something?

391
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:09.667
Or are you joining us
for a game of hide-and-seek?

392
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.045
Sorry. HR won't let me
play games with my boss.

393
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:16.507
which you are. because you bought us
and then shut us down.

394
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.218
Yeah. I... Well. yeah...
I'm sorry about that.

395
00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.722
I couldn't let you talk shit about me
in a murder podcast.

396
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.598
Accusations like that...

397
00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.268
I'm just trying to protect my family.

398
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:30.229
You keep making excuses.
yet I have no evidence

399
00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:32.398
that you're actually a good guy.

400
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:36.277
Well. if you responded to my texts.
I would show you that I am one.

401
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.822
HR also won't let me date bosses.

402
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:43.325
Plus. there's that whole thing
where you're a suspect.

403
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:44.702
Mm. fair.

404
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:47.621
But if I wasn't.
could I take you out to dinner?

405
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.752
I'm not a Bond villain. I promise.

406
00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.628
Although I do have a white cat
and my dad's office

407
00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.714
is located on the side of a mountain.

408
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:04.764
Look. I know my friends are eccentric.

409
00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:09.226
But really. we're just a bunch of bored.
rich people hashing out a bet.

410
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.687
The same one we were trying
to settle the last time

411
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:12.938
we were in that gaming parlor.

412
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.317
Do you mean when Lester died?

413
00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:18.527
Uh...

414
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.362
What do you know?

415
00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.200
Fine. Don't tell me.

416
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.993
I'll find out myself.

417
00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:29.371
Shit.

418
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.290
Alright. cut the shit.

419
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:35.377
Jay admitted this is about
way more than a stupid trophy.

420
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:41.342
So. you don't wanna answer
our questions. fine.

421
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.136
We'll do it your way.

422
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.223
We play you for answers.

423
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:50.559
- Wait. Mabel. are you serious?
- You wanna play games with them?!

424
00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.978
The last time they were doing that.
two whole people died.

425
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.480
If we win...

426
00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:57.233
we wanna know everything.

427
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.984
A ratcheting up of the stakes.

428
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.737
Leaning in. liking.

429
00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.657
What happens if you lose?

430
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.537
We stop investigating you. forever.

431
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:15.668
Fine.

432
00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:18.754
And when we win.

433
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.048
if you don't hold
to your end of the bargain.

434
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:22.258
we'll kill you.

435
00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.305
Kidding.

436
00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:30.933
And that's a wrap on me.

437
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.852
Bye. everybody.
Enjoy your twisted game night.

438
00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:35.104
Oliver. you can't leave.

439
00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.273
What about doing this for Lester?
You're being selfish.

440
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:40.401
Yeah. enough with
"Oliver is selfish" shtick.

441
00:22:40.484 --> 00:22:44.029
And you're not doing this for Lester.
you're just mad you got scammed online.

442
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:47.908
And besides. unlike you two.
I have someone to lose.

443
00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:50.327
I'm sorry. but it's true.

444
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:54.623
So. if you wanna risk your lives
playing a game. go for it.

445
00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:55.791
But I'm out.

446
00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:05.050
Ladies and gentlemen.

447
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.802
the game is <i>Celebrity.</i>

448
00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:09.179
How many famous people
can you guess in a minute?

449
00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:11.390
One round. winner takes all.

450
00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.475
Our team will draw a category first.

451
00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:17.021
"Historical figures."

452
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.023
Do you think they know about history?

453
00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:21.442
No way.
They're too busy with world domination

454
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.027
to read biographies.

455
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.739
Mm-hmm. Okay.

456
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.782
Start the timer... now!

457
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:33.495
He comes to my. um.
uh. my Labor Day party every year

458
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.081
- and bakes a pineapple upside-down cake.
- Vladimir Putin!

459
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.003
Um. um. Jay. he and your granddad
did... did sleepaway camp

460
00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.088
- in the Schwarzwild.
- Uh. Henry Kissinger!

461
00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:46.175
Um. um... Oh. good God.

462
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.802
He will not shut up
about Crumbl Cookies.

463
00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:50.304
Kim Jong Un!

464
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:53.140
What are we gonna do?

465
00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:55.059
Hope for an easier category.

466
00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:56.310
This guy.

467
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:57.478
Bernie Sanders!

468
00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:02.358
Camila. um. he and you.
uh. call each other "Bunny Face."

469
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:03.984
- and I don't know why.
- Xi Jinping.

470
00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:05.402
and the reason is just for us!

471
00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:08.238
Time.

472
00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.992
You got five.

473
00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:14.370
- Oh. Mm. Hmm.
- Yeah.

474
00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:17.957
Bravo. Papa.

475
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.210
Algie. to the cellar.

476
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.299
Your turn.

477
00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:35.975
Don't worry. we got this.

478
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:37.601
We're smart people.
We know things.

479
00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:42.147
Okay. our category is...

480
00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:46.568
"Broadway."

481
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.198
<i>♪ The coffee cup ♪</i>

482
00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:53.367
<i>♪ I think about you ♪</i>

483
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.247
<i>♪ I love you so.
it's like I'm losing my mind ♪</i>

484
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.837
<i>♪ Lions and tigers
and bears. oh. shit! ♪</i>

485
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.214
<i>♪ Lions and tigers and bears ♪</i>
Oh. shit!

486
00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:09.049
How do we not have Oliver for this?

487
00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:10.759
It's okay.
You know Broadway. right?

488
00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:13.262
Yes. I've seen one play once.

489
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.472
and it was the first 15 seconds
of <i>Death Rattle.</i>

490
00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:17.349
before Ben Glenroy dropped dead.

491
00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.685
Just do your best. no pressure.
Well. some pressure.

492
00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:21.895
Our entire investigation depends on it.

493
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.192
Your time starts now.

494
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:28.902
Okay. um...

495
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:30.738
Pass.

496
00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:31.822
Hold on.

497
00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:33.073
No. pass.

498
00:25:33.157 --> 00:25:35.701
- Say something. Mabel.
- I'm trying! Pass.

499
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:37.077
- Pass.
- Anything but "pass"!

500
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.121
Ugh! Where's Oliver when you need him?

501
00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:41.165
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait!
I know this one.

502
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:42.791
The boots!
She was naked in the boots.

503
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.460
Linda Lavin!

504
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:47.046
Okay. Oliver claims
he was an assistant doula

505
00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:48.589
- at her birth.
- Uh. Lea Michele!

506
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:50.841
Oliver says he and this person

507
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.260
took an Ativan and slept through
all of Hurricane Sandy.

508
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:54.511
Hugh Jackman!

509
00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:58.974
Oliver claims he invented both the name
"Adele Dazeem" and her real one.

510
00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:02.394
The wickedly talented Idina Menzel!

511
00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:04.188
Ugh. Oliver's biggest beef is with...?

512
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:06.732
The Jessica...
Angela Lansbury!

513
00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:09.318
Oliver says she stole his haircut.

514
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.986
Cynthia Nixon!

515
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.237
- Time.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah!

516
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.452
You motherfuckers beat us.

517
00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:20.579
We sure did.

518
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:23.874
Now. tell us what you were playing for.

519
00:26:28.629 --> 00:26:29.630
Okay.

520
00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:35.969
The night your doorman died.
we played for a very big contract.

521
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.846
probably the biggest development project

522
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.350
to hit New York City
since... Grand Central.

523
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.477
- The most important...
- Oh. my God!

524
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:47.606
One of you is planning to build
New York City's first casino.

525
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.274
I was ramping up.

526
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:52.361
But yes.

527
00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.072
We all have our proposals.

528
00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:59.451
Tonight's winner
gets to see theirs come to life.

529
00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:01.954
That's a terrible idea.

530
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:04.373
You think a casino
would be good for the city?

531
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:06.667
I think about how much money
it would make.

532
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.627
How much power the owner would wield.

533
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.504
And how it's a chance to make your name

534
00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:12.172
synonymous with New York City history.

535
00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.715
That's Rockefeller shit.

536
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:14.883
How noble.

537
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:19.888
And how do you three
just get to decide that. anyway?

538
00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:22.599
Deals have always been made
in back rooms.

539
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:25.143
Games are just our way of making it fun.

540
00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:28.605
That still doesn't explain why you
edited the footage from that night.

541
00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:33.110
Well. frankly. I don't like anyone
knowing my comings and goings.

542
00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:36.822
Yesterday. I treated Algernon
to a Jamba Juice.

543
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.408
- Ooh.
- Scrubbed that. too.

544
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.410
Mm. And we wouldn't want people

545
00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.204
losing faith in the system.
now. would we?

546
00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:47.040
So. you didn't kill anyone?

547
00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:49.710
This has nothing to do with our doorman?

548
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.008
This is about a casino
and a stupid trophy?

549
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.096
Are you guys good?

550
00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:04.600
We just really like the trophy.
Put the trophy down.

551
00:28:17.613 --> 00:28:20.866
Your prize is our fucking finger.

552
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.294
Come on. you overpriced brick.

553
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.339
Survived a hot bowl of barley soup.
and now you crap out?

554
00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:39.760
Thank Mary Tyler Moore.

555
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:42.554
Oh. dear.

556
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.516
Oh. mother's balls!

557
00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:50.520
You think he knows
he's goin' to the vet?

558
00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:52.564
Well. if he didn't. he does now.

559
00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:57.361
Ooh. it's one of those "Silver Alerts."

560
00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.528
Always so sad

561
00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:00.238
- when an old person goes missing.
- Aw.

562
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:03.325
Oh. thank God! Thank God.

563
00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.118
You gotta save me!

564
00:29:05.202 --> 00:29:08.789
I'm in danger.

565
00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.833
You poor thing.
Anyone we can call for you?

566
00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:14.753
Well. I tried my wife.
and... and no reception.

567
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:18.048
Plus. she's probably halfway
to New Zealand to shoot her TV show.

568
00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:19.549
She's a Hollywood actress.

569
00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:22.886
Of course. she is.

570
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.972
- Uh. should we try the police station?
- Uh...

571
00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:27.391
No. no! No. no. no.
The police are in on it.

572
00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:28.600
Goes all the way to the top.

573
00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:33.271
The mayor told me this morning
when he came over to record my podcast.

574
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:35.899
- I bet he did.
- Yeah.

575
00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:38.944
End of the day is toughest.

576
00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:45.200
- Gotta get the hell outta here.
- We gotta call a car.

577
00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.743
Oh!

578
00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:48.954
So. you're a "good guy." huh?

579
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:51.665
Mabel. you're in more danger
than you think with that finger.

580
00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.917
You have no idea
what they paid to get that.

581
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:56.003
Paid who?

582
00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.464
Wait.

583
00:29:59.548 --> 00:30:03.010
So then. this is your legacy?

584
00:30:03.093 --> 00:30:06.054
Trapping a woman at one
of your game nights to get it back?

585
00:30:07.347 --> 00:30:10.767
- A woman and her friend.
- Is no one going to stop them?

586
00:30:11.601 --> 00:30:12.602
Really?

587
00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:14.646
Okay. go. Now.

588
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.731
Now.

589
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.070
And Zach Galifianakis
is playing me in the movie. so...

590
00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:24.948
- Well. isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah.

591
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:29.327
Alright. let's hop on in.
We can drop off Blaze on the way.

592
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.456
Oh. God. I... Really.
I cannot thank you two enough.

593
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:34.207
I mean...

594
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:37.294
...if I had to walk back
to Manhattan in these boots.

595
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:39.671
Charles and Mabel
would never let me live it down.

596
00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:42.382
Are those your friends?
Um. should we give them a call?

597
00:30:42.466 --> 00:30:45.427
Well. actually they're...
they're at Bash Steed's place.

598
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.970
uh. with no service. so...

599
00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:48.513
- Bash Steed.
- Yeah.

600
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:50.932
They can't be that good of friends then.

601
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:53.894
if they let you wander off
all on your lonesome.

602
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:56.480
Well. actually.
they're... they're great friends.

603
00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:59.816
I mean. if it wasn't for them. who knows
what would have happened to me?

604
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.986
I... I... I wouldn't have a podcast.

605
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.572
I wouldn't have met the love of my life.

606
00:31:05.655 --> 00:31:07.699
And I certainly
wouldn't have reconnected

607
00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:10.285
with my best friend. Ron-Ron Howard.

608
00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:13.997
- I call him Ron-Ron.
- Wow.

609
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.457
Yeah.

610
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.375
- Uh. well. I...
- Meanwhile. I'm the one

611
00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:19.753
who left them alone with a group

612
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:23.673
of deeply unwell rich people.
you know?

613
00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:25.383
I mean. they... they can't even
call an Uber.

614
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.010
They have no way out of there.

615
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.931
Oh. my God.
What have I done?

616
00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:35.060
- I need you to drive me back!
- No can do. hon.

617
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.937
We're gonna take you
somewhere safe. Get in.

618
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.565
No. no. I'm gonna save my friends
from murderous billionaires!

619
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:42.234
And if you won't drive me...

620
00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:46.738
- I'm taking the horse!
- Oh.

621
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:48.824
Oh. oh!
Come on. buddy.

622
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:52.536
I have a strong sense
you're not the best on bareback.

623
00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:55.747
I'll have you know
that I am the first and last director

624
00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:57.624
to ever stage <i>Equus</i> with a live...

625
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.294
Is everything out here demonic?

626
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:04.965
How am I gonna get back to my friends?!

627
00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:07.259
Dammit!
How are we gonna get out of here?

628
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:08.510
Mabel.

629
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.138
Shit.

630
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:13.515
You know. there's something I have to say.
and I have to say it fast

631
00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:16.268
before I get. uh. sent to the cellar
with Algernon.

632
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:17.352
What?

633
00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:20.021
Oliver was right.
I threw myself into this case

634
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:23.733
because I was sad I got catfished.
and I thought I had nothing to lose.

635
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:25.527
But I have a lot to lose.

636
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.487
My family.

637
00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:30.240
- You.
- Oliver.

638
00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:31.616
Yeah. Oliver.

639
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.577
No! Oliver!

640
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.746
Get away from my friends.
you sons of bitches!

641
00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:45.547
You came back for us!

642
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.507
- I should never have left!
- No. you were right.

643
00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:49.426
These people are insane.

644
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:51.094
Mabel. get in!

645
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:53.430
And we got matches!

646
00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:58.185
Oliver. those Linda Lavin boots saved us!

647
00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:01.396
- Where are we going?
- <i>♪ To the Old Town Road ♪</i>

648
00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.773
We're riding all the way to Manhattan!

649
00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:04.941
Ha. ha!

650
00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:07.944
I'm not saying we're gonna
get there quickly.

651
00:33:09.968 --> 00:33:13.383
<i>Subtitle extract by: Dream Ports</i>
insta: @Dream_Ports

652
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:17.287
Can't believe this finger has to do
with the first casino

653
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.206
in New York City.

654
00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:21.708
I can't believe that dead finger
is back in my apartment.

655
00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:25.003
I can't believe Loretta
called in a Silver Alert for me.

656
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.130
And it didn't even mention
any of my credits.

657
00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:31.092
Okay. that must be Williams.

658
00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:33.762
I hope she can identify that thing
before it learns to crawl.

659
00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:35.555
Hmm.

660
00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:37.641
Oh. oh.

661
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.061
Oh. uh. look who. uh...

662
00:33:41.144 --> 00:33:44.147
You'll have to excuse me
for arriving so late.

663
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:46.650
They say don't go to bed mad.
so I thought I'd come

664
00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:48.652
and settle our little tiff.

665
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:51.404
Hm. you mean the fact that you lied
about the casino

666
00:33:51.488 --> 00:33:54.199
having anything to do with our murder?

667
00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:58.453
Like it or not. that finger
decides the casino bid.

668
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:01.748
and New York is only
giving out one permit.

669
00:34:01.831 --> 00:34:04.709
I don't know if you've seen
Jay and Bash's proposals.

670
00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:06.503
but they're grotesque.

671
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:10.131
Jay wants to put his
in the 92nd Street YMCA

672
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:14.261
because. and I quote.
"A pool would be so sick."

673
00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:18.098
And Bash's big idea is a spaceship

674
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:22.394
floating over Times Square
and the M&M's store.

675
00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.854
- A travesty.
- Hmm. Yeah...

676
00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:27.983
My casino will be different. Bespoke.

677
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.820
I am giving the people of New York
what they don't know they need.

678
00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.697
A gambling addiction?

679
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.074
I will make gambling so chic.

680
00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:38.827
Gwyneth Paltrow will shit her capris.

681
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.538
That's really compelling. Camila.

682
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:44.040
- but we're not giving you the finger.
- Mm-mm.

683
00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:46.209
Oh. I worried you might say that. so...

684
00:34:46.293 --> 00:34:48.461
Give me the finger!

685
00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.882
You're bluffing.
and we're not giving you the finger.

686
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:56.803
Willing to risk it?

687
00:34:57.887 --> 00:34:59.931
Give her the finger.
Give her the finger.

688
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:09.983
I can't wait to share with the world
my quiet slots.

689
00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:13.111
It's not... "ding!"
It's... "ding."

690
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.034
I think I'll start renovations with...

691
00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:22.370
Oliver's apartment.

692
00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:25.332
What are you talking about?

693
00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:27.917
That offer on your place
was from me.

694
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:31.087
I'm the one buying up
all the apartments here.

695
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:33.256
so I can finally build.

696
00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:38.261
Exclusive first look.

697
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:44.100
The Camila Club?

698
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.019
Is that...

699
00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:47.520
Our lobby?

700
00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:50.398
Our courtyard?

701
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.986
You're turning The Arconia into a casino?

702
00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:58.865
Well. have a good night.

703
00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:02.035
Hopefully. they'll have murders
in your next building. too.
