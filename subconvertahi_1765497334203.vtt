<i>that everybody is dying
for you to answer.</i>

17
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.598
<i>Where have you been

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:15.633
<i>and made your CFO Vic Mahoney
CEO of King-Tech?</i>

19

<i>After everything
that happened.</i>

20
00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:18.901

21
00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:21.042
<i>that sometimes
you really do have to just</i>

22
00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:22.640

<i>So. uh. I sort of
bought an island.</i>

24
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.075
<i>An island?</i>

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:30.384
<i>No phones. no work.
We grow our own food.</i>

26
00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.020
<i>I wear the same thing
every day.</i>

27
00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:33.386

28
00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:35.216
<i>- Chickens?
- Yeah. I have chickens.</i>

29
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.825
<i>Seems like
you really are a changed man.</i>

30
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.924
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

31
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.497
<i>So. last year you started
the King-Tech Foundation.</i>

32
00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:46.127

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.942

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:15.524
Oh. Sorry.

00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:18.127
The super's
gonna be here soon.

47
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.532
Right. About that...

48
00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.588
- Oh. what did you do?
- It's a surprise for you.

49
00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:23.338
- Oh. boy.
- I love you.

50
00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:25.505
Wait. Do we have any...

51
00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:29.971
Thanks.

52
00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:47.389

- Hmm.
- You're late.

59
00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:14.354
Oh. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.321
I missed
the bus and...

61
00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.588
This is the King-Tech gala.

62
00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.320
the most important event
of the year.

63
00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:21.033
Can we just have a quick talk
about your behavior last year?

64
00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:22.690
- It was a little chatty. so...
- No.

65
00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:25.066
No. no. no. He talked to me.

66
00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:26.278
He told me he liked my nails.

67
00:04:26.302 --> 00:04:27.302
- That's it.
- Anyway...

68
00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:28.733
I just want. this time around.

69
00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.933
you to be a little bit
more invisible. okay?

70
00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.607
Okay.

71
00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:36.486
- Okay? Can you do that?
- Yes. I can do that.

72
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.905
- Okay.
- I can.

73
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:40.107
- And don't forget to smile.
- I won't.

74
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:44.452
I missed my audition

75
00:04:44.587 --> 00:04:45.725
waiting for the super
who never showed up.

76
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:46.914
So we still have black mold

77
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.490
and I guess
we're just gonna die now.

78
00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:49.794
Yo. Jess.
can I get your lighter?

79
00:04:49.818 --> 00:04:51.692
Yes. But I want it back.

80
00:04:51.828 --> 00:04:53.738
I'm gonna have to write
my goddamn name on that thing.

81
00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:55.791
This haircut is so stupid.
Do I look like a boy?

82
00:04:55.927 --> 00:04:58.632
A very cute boy.

83
00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:01.469
I heard you sneaking out
last night at. like. 3:00 a.m.

84
00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:03.833
Where'd you go?

85
00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.439
- Heh.
- What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:08.102
- Don't be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

87
00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:10.940
I just can't magically
erase shit from my brain.

88
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.715
So. when you
get back together.

89
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:17.284
don't expect me to pretend
like I don't want to stab him.

90
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.252
- It's complicated.
- It's not.

91
00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:20.948
Stop giving away your power.

92
00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:22.364
You're not a human
phone charger.

93
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.953
Just have some self-respect.

94
00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:28.964
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:31.191
I love you.

96
00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:33.930
I just don't understand
why you keep going back.

97
00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:36.766
I guess I'm just scared
of being alone.

98
00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:40.468
Aw. You're not alone.
You have me.

99
00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:41.603
Mmm. Yeah.

100
00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.845
Don't forget to smile. ladies.

101
00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:46.912
<i>All right.</i>

102
00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:50.015
<i>Okay. Okay. okay.
let's get serious. people.</i>

103
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.884
<i>We want to thank you all
for being here with us tonight</i>

104
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.017
<i>so that the King Foundation

105
00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:57.124

- I'm so sorry.
<i>- ...Mr. Slater King.</i>

113
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.839
Careful.

114
00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:17.805
You're gonna sprain your neck.

115
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.613
I don't care if I break it.

116
00:06:22.112 --> 00:06:23.710
Ready
for your surprise?

117
00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:25.047
Oh. boy.

118
00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:30.553
- Red or blue?
- Uh...

119
00:06:33.695 --> 00:06:35.396
This is crazy.

120
00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:36.739
I know. right?

121
00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.071
No.
it's. like. crazy-crazy.

122
00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:39.561
We just can't really
afford to...

123
00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:41.201
Jess. don't do that.

124
00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:43.036
No. Whose time is it?

125
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:44.171
Our time.

126
00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.638
You know what my mom
used to say?

127
00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:49.606
- Hmm?
- Success is the best revenge.

128
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:50.940
You think he'll remember me?

129
00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:52.491
Who could forget you?

130
00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:53.556
You know?

131
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.909
- Oh. shit!
- You okay?

132
00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:57.145
Sorry.
Yeah. I just.

133
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.792
I don't know how to walk
in these fucking things.

134
00:06:58.816 --> 00:06:59.859
Okay. do this thing my aunt

135
00:06:59.883 --> 00:07:00.883
- taught me. okay?
- Okay.

136
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.357
East. west. east. west.

137
00:07:04.493 --> 00:07:07.121
East. west. east. west.

138
00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:09.861
- East. west. east. west.
- Hello.

139
00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:13.700
East. east. West. east.
west. east. west...

140
00:07:13.835 --> 00:07:15.635
Oh. shit.
It's Jennifer. Fuck.

141
00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.941
Oh. hold up.

142
00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:23.985
I think it's because
people like me would touch it.

143
00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.082
So it's smarter
for them to do that.

144
00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:26.447
I wouldn't want to ruin it.

145
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:27.944
Ladies.
this is a private area.

146
00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:29.679
Could I have you step
that way. please?

147
00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:31.344
- Oh. okay.
- Yeah. sure.

148
00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:33.159
- Hey. Stan.
- Hey. Cody. how are you doin'?

149
00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:36.684
- Good.
- South. south. south.

150
00:07:40.863 --> 00:07:43.427
Hey. how much you think
that little head costs?

151
00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.798
Like. a million dollars?

152
00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.432
I wonder if that alarm would
go off if you stole...

153
00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:51.367
Frida. Frida.

154
00:07:51.502 --> 00:07:52.706
Frida?

155
00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.047
Shit.

156
00:08:05.982 --> 00:08:07.215
Are you all right?

157
00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:14.424
Here. may I?

158
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.894
Yeah.

159
00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:20.899
Saw it in a movie once.

160
00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:22.642
and I've always
wanted to do it.

161
00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:23.869
Now you're even.

162
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.340
Slater.

163
00:08:27.137 --> 00:08:28.808
- Rich!
- Hey.

164
00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:30.249
the speech turned out great.

165
00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:31.833
Really? Are you sure?
I mean...

166
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.117
How did it feel to be...

167
00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:34.426
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- ...just scared

168
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.580
- to say anything.
- Yes?

169
00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:36.981
I know. I know.

170
00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:38.489
- I totally understand.
- Your hand.

171
00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:40.033
I was very proud of you.
Listen.

172
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:41.349
- you've come a long way.
- Oh.

173
00:08:42.118 --> 00:08:43.956
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.730
Listen. I'm...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

175
00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:47.954
No. no. You're not
interrupting. This is. um...

176
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:51.026
Uh. I actually
haven't asked your name.

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:53.294
Frida. I'm Frida.

178
00:08:54.598 --> 00:08:55.598

179
00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:57.637
Yeah.

180
00:08:57.773 --> 00:09:00.137
Uh. Frida.
this is Dr. Rich Stein.

181
00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:03.205
Um. he's...
He's actually my therapist.

182
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:05.612
- Oh.

183
00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:06.952
I'm just kidding.

184
00:09:06.976 --> 00:09:07.976
Very nice to meet you.

185
00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:09.309
Blink twice if I'm in danger.

186
00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:10.964
- Oh. dear.
- Well. maybe not.

187
00:09:11.048 --> 00:09:12.346
Let's not answer
that one. right?

188
00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.160
Well.
I'll let you get back to it.

213
00:09:56.966 --> 00:09:58.405

You got all that?
It's a bit of a whirlwind.

Do I know you from somewhere?

227
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.796
- Seen you somewhere? No?
- No. I don't think so.

228
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.385

240
00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:16.809
I forgot you own
your own island.

241
00:11:16.945 --> 00:11:18.813
It's casual.

242
00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:21.209
So casual. Yeah.

243
00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:22.982

- Can we go?
- I gotta go.

247
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.428
I need to be in a place
where I can get

248
00:11:30.452 --> 00:11:31.991
- an umbrella in my drink.
- Yeah.

249

Did you see that?

252
00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:46.535
He was like...
to me.

253
00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:50.338
Another chapter
for the memoir. my dear.

254
00:11:50.473 --> 00:11:52.339
- Yeah. totally.
- Did you get his number?

255
00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:53.795
Of course I fucking didn't.
How...

256
00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.146
What are you talking about?

257
00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.926
- How does a dude like that...?
- After all that?

258
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.157
I don't know.

259
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.486

Okay.

337
00:17:00.783 --> 00:17:02.288
So do you think
the human sacrifice

338
00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:05.520

339
00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:07.821

You look so good.

342
00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:17.248
Is it weird that

00:17:17.272 --> 00:17:18.512
I don't know.
It's cute.

344
00:17:18.603 --> 00:17:19.710
How'd they know
our bra size?

345
00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:21.074
They're probably gonna

346
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.250
be dressed exactly
the same too.

I'm learning a lot.

355
00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:43.393
But eventually. I wanna do

356
00:17:43.528 --> 00:17:44.836
my own thing. you know?

357
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.300
I wanna be the Slater King
of crypto.

358
00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:47.162
Hey. Vic.
you want some watermelon?

359
00:17:47.298 --> 00:17:48.431
Thank you.

362
00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:54.073
What? What do you mean
it's a little chewy?

363
00:17:54.209 --> 00:17:55.449
Why do you always
gotta do that?

Two eyes.

367
00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:09.482
three little buttons.

00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:11.220

00:18:36.112 --> 00:18:39.050
Oh. I knew it. You were
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes.</i>

378
00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:40.652
Eight seasons.

379
00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.587
Yo. you went cuckoo for
Cocoa Puffs on that show.

380
00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.589
Well.
they edit a lot of shit out.

381
00:18:47.428 --> 00:18:49.296

388
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.490
Frida. you okay?

389
00:19:27.732 --> 00:19:29.299

Hmm.

Desideria.

394
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.982
It actually only grows here.

395
00:19:49.117 --> 00:19:51.057
- Oh.
- We got a beautiful

396
00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:53.488
little herb garden over here.

397
00:19:53.623 --> 00:19:55.956
Got our chickens.

398
00:19:57.326 --> 00:19:59.332
You know.

399
00:19:59.467 --> 00:20:01.830
it's not what I thought
it was gonna be.

400
00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:03.996
What do you mean?

401
00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:06.599
The legendary parties
of Slater King

402
00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:09.240
with drugs and debauchery.

403
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.451
We still do drugs.

404
00:20:13.877 --> 00:20:15.179
We just do them
with intention.

405
00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:16.744
And we still have fun.

406
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.879
It's just a little
different now.

407
00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:21.414
Therapy changed my life.

408
00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.150
Thanks. guys.

409
00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:26.591
Yeah. we have a bit of
a pest problem at the moment.

410
00:20:27.424 --> 00:20:28.521
It's a lash viper.

411
00:20:28.657 --> 00:20:31.097
I feel bad killing them.

412
00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:32.960
but they're kind of a problem.

413
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:35.329
Are you in therapy?

414
00:20:35.464 --> 00:20:36.833
Oh. no. No.

415
00:20:36.968 --> 00:20:39.833
I think therapy is kind of
self-indulgent bullshit.

416
00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:41.837
You sound exactly
like my sister.

417
00:20:41.972 --> 00:20:43.812
Why should I pay to tell
someone about the time

418
00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:46.041
my mom tried to kill herself
in front of me?

419
00:20:46.343 --> 00:20:48.480
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:48.616 --> 00:20:50.145
It's fine. I survived.
I'm still here.

421
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.484
Yeah.

422
00:20:52.854 --> 00:20:55.584
But I agree with you on
the whole talk therapy thing.

423
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.017
That's not really
what I'm into.

424
00:20:57.152 --> 00:20:59.954
Rich is more of. like.
a trauma therapist.

425
00:21:00.089 --> 00:21:03.529
Uh. you know. specializes
in repressed memory.

426
00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:06.531
What can't you remember?

427
00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:10.167
Uh. pretty much
anything before 10.

428
00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:11.964
So I imagine it was

429
00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:14.636
probably pretty bad?

430
00:21:14.772 --> 00:21:16.877
Why would you
want to remember?

431
00:21:17.012 --> 00:21:18.379
I'd pay to forget.

432
00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:20.476
Maybe you're right.

433
00:21:20.611 --> 00:21:22.281
Maybe forgetting is a gift.

434
00:21:22.416 --> 00:21:23.976
- Oh. God.
- Oh. shit.

435
00:21:24.112 --> 00:21:25.383
Don't even bother.
She's got it.

436
00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:26.625
- No. no.
- Let me help you.

437
00:21:26.649 --> 00:21:28.082
No. no. no. I got it.

438
00:21:28.218 --> 00:21:29.695
She's physically
incapable of accepting help.

439
00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:32.118
Relax. you're on vacation.

440
00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:34.855
Oh. Slater. uh.

441
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:37.295
I had them put the chair
in the new spot.

442
00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:38.659
- Okay.
- So let me know

443
00:21:38.795 --> 00:21:40.399
if it seems less weird there.

444
00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.201
- Okay.
- I think it looks nice.

445
00:21:42.337 --> 00:21:44.735
Uh. also. um. the vape liquid.

446
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.076
- I put in your desk.
- All right.

447
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.703
- And one more.
- Yeah?

448
00:21:47.838 --> 00:21:49.669
The new generator
is not working.

449
00:21:49.804 --> 00:21:51.104
So I had all the candles.

450
00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:52.785
uh. laid out in the...
in the dining room.

451
00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:53.809
- Okay.
- Okay?

452
00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:55.581
Appreciate you. I love you.

453
00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:58.485
I love you too.

454
00:22:01.523 --> 00:22:04.018
Oh. my God.

455
00:22:04.153 --> 00:22:08.159
I haven't
seen you in years.

456
00:22:08.294 --> 00:22:10.030
It's been decades.

457
00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:11.331
Do you come here often?

458
00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:13.430
- Oh. all the time.
- Oh. of course.

459
00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.095
This is where I reside now.

460
00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:17.268
This is my home.

461
00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:19.232
East. west. east...

462
00:22:19.368 --> 00:22:22.609
Friends. tonight
we have zucchini blossoms.

463
00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:26.544
fresh from the organic garden
right here at Chez King.

464
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.674
We have a yuca
mofongo croquetas.

465
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.110
which is deep-fried. uh.

466
00:22:30.245 --> 00:22:31.982
which is a little bit
naughty.

467
00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:35.515
And. of course. we have this
beautifully dry-aged steak.

468
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:37.053
Blessings. Enjoy.

469
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.492
Oh. Wow.

470
00:22:38.627 --> 00:22:40.888
Everybody raise your glasses
for Camilla here.

471
00:22:41.024 --> 00:22:42.762
- No. don't do that.
- Yep.

472
00:22:42.898 --> 00:22:45.165
She just finalized the sale
of her app as of yesterday.

473
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.829
Welcome to King-Tech. girl.

474
00:22:46.964 --> 00:22:49.169
Thank you. Thanks. guys.

475
00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:50.603
What's it... How does it work?

476
00:22:50.738 --> 00:22:52.731
It's an astrology thing.
It's called The Cycle.

477
00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:54.134
Dude. it's awesome.

478
00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:56.476
You put in your birth time
and location.

479
00:22:56.611 --> 00:22:57.985
- Mmm-hmm.
- And it tells you

480
00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.975
that the reason that
your sitcom got canceled

481
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.876
and your wife is sucking
the neighbor's dick

482
00:23:02.012 --> 00:23:03.943
while you're eating eggs
to slim down

483
00:23:04.078 --> 00:23:06.351
so that somebody
will fuck you...

484
00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:07.685
...is because

485
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.052
the planet Saturn
is trying to teach you

486
00:23:10.187 --> 00:23:12.988
how to process your emotions
in a healthier way.

487
00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.930
I'm glad
you're finding it helpful.

488
00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:18.066
It's awesome.

489
00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:20.534
Buddy.

490
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:22.795
Ah. I just love cooking
for my friends.

491
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:24.199
It just hits different.

492
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:25.867
Looks beautiful. Cody.

493
00:23:26.003 --> 00:23:27.667
Yeah.
dig into the steak. guys.

494
00:23:27.803 --> 00:23:29.540
- Mmm.
- Dude.

495
00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:31.176
- Can I have some salt?
- Really?

496
00:23:31.311 --> 00:23:33.272
Yeah. It needs it.

497
00:23:33.407 --> 00:23:35.087
- You want one?
- No. I don't eat red meat.

498
00:23:35.178 --> 00:23:38.080
- Oh. Sorry.
- This place is insane.

499
00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:39.593
- So pretty.
- Give me the pepper too.

500
00:23:39.617 --> 00:23:40.850
Fuck you. Vic.

501
00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:42.292
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

502
00:23:42.316 --> 00:23:44.586
I'm glad you're having
a good... Ooh.

503
00:23:44.722 --> 00:23:46.186
You got. like. a little...

504
00:23:48.492 --> 00:23:49.492
Uh-oh!

505
00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:50.991
Kool-Aid on the cult robe.

506
00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:53.029
- Oh.
- Oopsie-daisy.

507
00:23:53.164 --> 00:23:54.964
Don't worry about it.
It's fine. You're good.

508
00:23:59.942 --> 00:24:02.769
So. uh. Sarah. are...
are you gonna be on <i>All-Stars?</i>

509
00:24:02.904 --> 00:24:04.545
I was gonna be. yeah.

510
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.577
But. after 22 years.
they've just decided

511
00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:09.680
a show about girls in bikinis

512
00:24:09.816 --> 00:24:11.417
fighting for their lives
in the jungle

513
00:24:11.552 --> 00:24:12.792
is exploitative.

514
00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:14.493
- And I'm. like...
- Smell that. babe.

515
00:24:14.517 --> 00:24:15.753
Wow.

516
00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:19.292
Yeah. so two years
of training for nothing.

517
00:24:19.428 --> 00:24:20.625
I'm sure it'll come in handy.

518
00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:26.932
Oh. that's gonna
open up beautifully.

519
00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:29.900
So. uh. Frida. when you're
not staining your clothes.

520
00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.002
what else do you do?

521
00:24:32.138 --> 00:24:36.372
Um... Well.
I'm just... I'm just trying

522
00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:37.870
to figure it out.

523
00:24:38.005 --> 00:24:39.474
Figuring it out. huh?

524
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.610
Yeah.

525
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.142
Let me know how that goes.

526
00:24:42.277 --> 00:24:43.848
Yeah. I guess
I just. you know.

527
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:45.323
don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

528
00:24:45.347 --> 00:24:47.213
You know. Vic here
has a Harvard degree

529
00:24:47.348 --> 00:24:49.047
in not knowing
what the fuck he's doing.

530
00:24:49.183 --> 00:24:50.716
Ask him how he lost his pinky.

531
00:24:50.852 --> 00:24:52.220
Yeah.

532
00:24:52.355 --> 00:24:55.627
No. What's the big deal?
I'm just asking questions.

533
00:24:55.763 --> 00:24:57.497
I like our new friend
Frida here.

534
00:24:57.632 --> 00:24:59.062
I think she's cool
and interesting.

535
00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:00.509
I just want to get to know
her better. that's all.

536
00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:02.163
All right.

537
00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:04.935
Hey. hey. hey!
Sip it. dude. Sip it.

538
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.267
The wine's older than you.

539
00:25:08.606 --> 00:25:10.303
Yeah. s... sorry.

540
00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:15.715
Offerings.
Time for the real dessert.

541
00:25:17.412 --> 00:25:20.851
These beautiful psilocybin
and MDMA droppies

542
00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.356
will introduce you
to your ancestors.

543
00:25:23.491 --> 00:25:24.656
Yeah.

544
00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:26.286
Blessings.
children of the forest.

545
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:28.794
Who's first?

546
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:30.994
Uh...

547
00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:32.495
How many do I do?

548
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.193
Come here.

549
00:25:34.328 --> 00:25:37.396
He's the master.

550
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.269
Uh-uh. Set your intention.

551
00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:51.080
One.

552
00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:53.219
Two.

553
00:25:54.089 --> 00:25:54.781
Three.

554
00:25:54.917 --> 00:25:56.486
I love you so much.

555
00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:58.116
I love you so much.

556
00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:01.392
I fucking love this pineapple.

557
00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:03.129
You're so beautiful.

558
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:06.564
Wow.

559
00:26:16.939 --> 00:26:18.808
Okay. Sleep.

560
00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:21.176
Okay. Okay.

561
00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:28.419
Huh.

562
00:26:31.786 --> 00:26:33.026
Weird.

563
00:26:33.161 --> 00:26:34.161
What?

564
00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:37.159
Nothing.

565
00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:48.474
- John Kennedy was here.
- Yeah.

566
00:26:48.609 --> 00:26:49.873
Blue fin. Belly cut.

567
00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:51.372
- Best in the world.
- Mmm.

568
00:26:51.507 --> 00:26:52.984
Whoa. Cody.
I mean. this is sick.

569
00:26:53.008 --> 00:26:54.581
Very special knife.

570
00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:56.249
Slater got it for me
in Okinawa.

571
00:26:56.385 --> 00:26:57.676
And it's very sharp.

572
00:26:57.812 --> 00:26:59.595
I just don't want you to cut
yourself. all right. dude?

573
00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:01.217
It's an original Hattori.

574
00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:02.960
He decides to throw
himself a birthday party.

575
00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:10.764
Thank you.

576
00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:29.476
There's something weird
going on here.

577
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:32.786
If by weird. you mean
that you're losing. again?

578
00:27:32.921 --> 00:27:35.081
Yeah. shit's getting
pretty fucking weird.

579
00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:37.185
What happened to your pinky?

580
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.452
What's the first rule
of Fight Club?

581
00:27:44.694 --> 00:27:46.095
What?

582
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:49.066
- Never mind. Here we go.
<i>- One.</i>

583
00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:50.535

<i>Four.</i>

Six.

588
00:27:59.412 --> 00:28:01.210
Seven.

589
00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:03.949
Eight.

590
00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:06.083
Nine.

591
00:28:07.421 --> 00:28:08.981
Ten!

592
00:28:13.857 --> 00:28:15.059
No! No. no. no!

593
00:28:18.761 --> 00:28:19.761
Hold it.

594
00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:22.495
I'm not... I'm not prepared...

595
00:28:57.605 --> 00:28:58.999
Having a good time?

596
00:28:59.135 --> 00:29:01.006
We're having a great time.

597
00:29:05.446 --> 00:29:06.506
Babe.

598
00:29:08.144 --> 00:29:10.048
Watermelon?

599
00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:16.083
That is a fat blunt. queen.

600
00:29:16.218 --> 00:29:18.353
Does anyone have a lighter?

601
00:29:24.064 --> 00:29:25.965
Heather. do you have
my lighter?

602
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.530
Sorry.

603
00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:56.990
- Can I try?
- Yeah.

604
00:30:02.102 --> 00:30:03.502
What is that?

605
00:30:03.638 --> 00:30:05.235
Is it. like. strawberry?

606
00:30:07.905 --> 00:30:09.305
Ooh.

607
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:12.274
That smells nice on you.

608
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:15.245
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

609
00:30:25.022 --> 00:30:26.685
How'd you get that scar?

610
00:30:33.128 --> 00:30:34.495
I don't know.

611
00:30:47.582 --> 00:30:49.180
I like your nails.

612
00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:51.413
Thanks.

613
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:54.454
I do them myself.

614
00:30:54.589 --> 00:30:55.615
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:30:57.024 --> 00:30:58.128
All right.
What do we got here?

616
00:30:58.152 --> 00:30:59.458
Blue cats.

617
00:30:59.593 --> 00:31:02.193
Yeah. Anailmals.

618
00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:04.497
What?

619
00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:08.162
It's. um. anailmals.

620
00:31:08.298 --> 00:31:10.366
It's animal nails.

621
00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:13.871
It's kind of my thing.
It's. um...

622
00:31:14.007 --> 00:31:16.006
- It's a play on...
- Oh. oh!

623
00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:17.942
- You get it?
- Fuck! Yes.

624
00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:20.447
- "A-nail-mals."
- Anailmals.

625
00:31:29.118 --> 00:31:30.718
I gotta go to bed.

626
00:31:30.854 --> 00:31:33.184
- I gotta go to bed.
- What?

627
00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.424
Why?

628
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.463
I got therapy in the morning.

629
00:31:37.598 --> 00:31:38.763
Oh. boo.

630
00:31:38.898 --> 00:31:40.264
Oh. boo. you.

631
00:31:41.934 --> 00:31:43.234
Wait. You forgot your...

632
00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:02.621
Ew.

633
00:32:21.872 --> 00:32:23.076
Hello?

634
00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:38.289
Hello?

635
00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:02.007
Frida?

636
00:33:02.143 --> 00:33:03.512
Hi.

637
00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:05.712
Hey.

638
00:33:06.986 --> 00:33:09.151
I. um...

639
00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.854
I thought you might want this.

640
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.587
Thank you. That's sweet.

641
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.589
So...

642
00:33:15.658 --> 00:33:17.294
- Whatcha doin'?
- Oh. man.

643
00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:20.098
Oh. look who it is.

644
00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:22.498
- Frida. this is Rich.
- Hi.

645
00:33:23.033 --> 00:33:24.066
Rich. Frida.

646
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:25.869
Very nice to meet you.

647
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:27.470
I remember you.

648
00:33:28.171 --> 00:33:29.571
From the gala?

649
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.673
"Blink twice
if I'm in danger"?

650
00:33:34.848 --> 00:33:36.182
That's right.

651
00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:37.751
That's right.

652
00:33:38.853 --> 00:33:40.653
Amazing.

653
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:41.813
Yeah. it's amazing.

654
00:33:41.949 --> 00:33:44.557
Hey. Stace?
It still feels weird here.

655
00:33:44.693 --> 00:33:45.693
Okay.

656
00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.390
I think we should try it
someplace else.

657
00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:50.294
Why don't we just
light it on fire?

658
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.426
That might make it
a little less weird.

659
00:33:52.561 --> 00:33:53.892
- Don't do that.
- Hi.

660
00:33:54.028 --> 00:33:56.197
Don't... Don't do that.
You know it bums me out.

661
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:58.505
- All right?
- Ah.

662
00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.799
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:00.942 --> 00:34:02.141
All right. young man.

664
00:34:02.276 --> 00:34:04.307
I'm headed back
to the mountaintop.

665
00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:05.908
- Always enjoy our chats.
- Yes. sir.

666
00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.478
Thank you.

667
00:34:07.614 --> 00:34:11.117
- Oh. and thanks for the gift.
- I'll walk you out.

668
00:34:11.252 --> 00:34:12.812
Hey. hon.
do you have the light?

669
00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:18.521
Where's my knife?
Who has my knife?

670
00:34:19.794 --> 00:34:20.794
What?

671
00:34:20.921 --> 00:34:22.481
My knife.
I can't find my special knife.

672
00:34:22.561 --> 00:34:24.521
Chill. You just
gotta ask somebody. man.

673
00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:25.324
You okay?

674
00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:26.793
Psst.

675
00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.101
Has anyone seen
Cody's special knife?

676
00:34:29.237 --> 00:34:30.863
I just don't know
where it went.

677
00:34:31.498 --> 00:34:33.032
You want this?

678
00:34:33.168 --> 00:34:35.217
No. thanks. Heather.
That weed makes me paranoid.

679
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:37.243
Nobody has your stupid knife.

680
00:34:59.763 --> 00:35:01.861
Something horrible
is about to happen.

681
00:35:05.268 --> 00:35:06.470
What?

682
00:35:08.371 --> 00:35:10.210
When things are good.

683
00:35:11.312 --> 00:35:13.345
that's when
the bad stuff happens.

684
00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:18.482
Why would you
think that?

685
00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:21.221
Life.

686
00:35:25.992 --> 00:35:27.458
What day is it?

687
00:35:30.062 --> 00:35:31.429
I don't know.

688
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.530
When are we leaving?

689
00:35:35.529 --> 00:35:36.869
Whenever you want.

690
00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:38.337
That's not an answer.

691
00:35:39.766 --> 00:35:41.538
Are you having a good time?

692
00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:43.006
Yes.

693
00:35:45.207 --> 00:35:46.411
Good.

694
00:35:48.476 --> 00:35:50.910
Boop.

695
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:14.435
Okay. who has got it?

696
00:36:14.571 --> 00:36:17.469
Who has got it this time. huh?

697
00:36:17.604 --> 00:36:19.741
- Not it.
- Oops.

698
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:23.041
I don't even remember
taking it.

699
00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:26.112
- I know who took it.
- Eh. eh. oh. ah! Oh!

700
00:36:26.247 --> 00:36:28.480
What. do I gotta write my name
on this fucking thing?

701
00:36:28.616 --> 00:36:29.782
Oh. shit.

702
00:36:29.918 --> 00:36:33.418
Pop Rocks in a tangerine
mojito sorbet.

703
00:36:35.457 --> 00:36:36.959
Shut up! Shut up!

704
00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:38.094
I got it.

705
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:39.398
I got it.

706
00:36:40.234 --> 00:36:41.365
I got it.

707
00:36:41.501 --> 00:36:42.229
- Let's go!
- Yes!

708
00:36:44.103 --> 00:36:45.104
Love it!

709
00:36:47.303 --> 00:36:49.072
Yeah!

710

<i>♪ What's the sense in sharing
This one and only life... ♪</i>

711
00:36:53.014 --> 00:36:54.014
That's right!

712
00:36:56.184 --> 00:36:58.549
All of this feels immaculate.

713
00:36:58.685 --> 00:37:00.716
Oh. my goodness. Okay.

Beautiful photo!
Hold it right there.

kid. is "fucking awesome."

746
00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:40.848
What is it?
Is it poisonous?

747
00:38:40.983 --> 00:38:42.543
It's venomous.
but you're not gonna die.

748
00:38:42.622 --> 00:38:43.929
- Oh. my God!
- No. no. no.

749
00:38:43.953 --> 00:38:45.525
- Is it dead?
- Here. Here.

750
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.665
You're okay. You're fine.

751
00:38:46.689 --> 00:38:48.255
Oh. my god!

752
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.065
Should I. like. be going to.
like. a hospital or something?

753
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:52.190
- You'll be fine.
- Besides...

754
00:38:54.128 --> 00:38:56.898
there are no hospitals.

755
00:39:00.836 --> 00:39:02.200
You want
some more water?

756
00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:07.473
How's your hand?

757
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:09.009
I feel weird.

758
00:39:11.513 --> 00:39:12.743
I want my phone.

759
00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:14.146
Okay.

760
00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:17.089
I wanna go home.

761
00:39:17.191 --> 00:39:18.458
Okay. let's not go crazy.

762
00:39:18.593 --> 00:39:21.053
Everybody is. like.
smiling and laughing

763
00:39:21.188 --> 00:39:23.088
like 1960s fucking
flight attendants.

764
00:39:23.223 --> 00:39:24.861
Like. "Are you having
a good time?"

765
00:39:24.997 --> 00:39:26.957
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm having
a great time."

766
00:39:27.662 --> 00:39:30.800
I'm scared. Frida.

767
00:39:30.936 --> 00:39:32.608
I think
you just need some sleep.

768
00:39:32.632 --> 00:39:36.470
Don't. No. no. don't. don't.
don't do that. Don't do that.

769
00:39:38.774 --> 00:39:40.579
Can't you feel it?

770
00:39:42.209 --> 00:39:46.618
There's something wrong
with this place.

771
00:39:49.717 --> 00:39:51.056
What's wrong?

772
00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:56.056
What's wrong?
I seriously want to know.

773
00:39:56.858 --> 00:39:58.861
Is it the amazing food?

774
00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:01.300
Or the tsunami of champagne?

775
00:40:01.435 --> 00:40:03.631
Or is it
the 1.020-thread-count

776
00:40:03.766 --> 00:40:05.237
fucking sheets? What is it?

777
00:40:05.372 --> 00:40:06.935
You're not listening to me.

778
00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:08.607
Please.

779
00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.576
Please.

780
00:40:11.712 --> 00:40:14.547
For the first time
in my life. I'm here.

781
00:40:15.912 --> 00:40:17.114
And
I'm not invisible.

782
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:18.782
So please.

783
00:40:19.515 --> 00:40:20.916
Please.

784
00:40:25.324 --> 00:40:26.526
I'm sorry.

785
00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:30.629
I'm sorry.

786
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.130
Yeah.

787
00:40:32.527 --> 00:40:33.731
Okay.

788
00:40:39.066 --> 00:40:40.667
I'm gonna go lay down.

789
00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:32.652
Hello?

790
00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:41.793
Oh.

791
00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:44.994
Hi.

792
00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:49.565
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just. um...

793
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.901
I was looking for Slater.

794
00:42:51.534 --> 00:42:52.738
Um...

795
00:42:53.767 --> 00:42:54.971
Hey.

796
00:42:56.376 --> 00:42:57.809
What's your name?

797
00:42:58.806 --> 00:43:00.179
Red rabbit.

798
00:43:00.314 --> 00:43:01.813
Red rabbit. right.

799
00:43:04.184 --> 00:43:05.184
Oh.

800
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.452
Oh. Don't worry. I won't tell.

801
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:10.888
I'm not a narc.

802
00:43:13.325 --> 00:43:14.353
Sure.

803
00:43:21.795 --> 00:43:25.804
Oh. my God. what's in that?
That's crazy strong!

804
00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:31.205
Red rabbit.

805
00:43:33.008 --> 00:43:35.809
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

806
00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:39.051
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

807
00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:40.186
Red...

808
00:43:46.891 --> 00:43:48.554
What are you doing over here?

809
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:49.894
I. uh...

810
00:43:51.925 --> 00:43:53.563
I got lost.

811
00:43:53.698 --> 00:43:55.196
You wanna go that way.

812
00:43:57.133 --> 00:43:59.304
Oh. the chickens got out.
Again.

813
00:43:59.439 --> 00:44:00.938
Fucking nightmare.

814
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:10.212
Come here. you little fucker.

815
00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.452
Wait. wait. wait.

816
00:44:19.152 --> 00:44:20.892
Why are we running?

817
00:44:32.566 --> 00:44:34.807
I don't know
why we do that.

818
00:44:37.443 --> 00:44:38.778
Hide this.

819
00:45:23.585 --> 00:45:26.023
All right. who did this?

820
00:45:27.856 --> 00:45:29.356
Seriously.

821
00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:34.394
When did I cut bangs?

822
00:45:39.707 --> 00:45:41.871
What's up?

823
00:45:42.007 --> 00:45:43.605
You've got a dick
on your face.

824
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.242
Yep.

825
00:45:45.378 --> 00:45:47.706

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:55.360
Oh. my God. Fuck. yeah.
There's blueberry muffins?

830
00:45:55.384 --> 00:45:57.016
It's
Slate's mom's recipe.

831
00:45:57.151 --> 00:45:59.387
Mmm. It's spectacular.

832
00:45:59.522 --> 00:46:01.442
- Thanks. bud.
- How'd you sleep?

833
00:46:01.955 --> 00:46:03.022
Amazing.

834
00:46:03.158 --> 00:46:04.396
All right. kids.

835
00:46:04.531 --> 00:46:06.195
Sails up.

836
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:08.764
Who's ready to catch
some beautiful grouper?

837
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.329
Let's do it. Is it cool

838
00:46:10.465 --> 00:46:11.713
if I bring the muffins?

839
00:46:11.737 --> 00:46:12.837
Bring the muffins.

840
00:46:12.972 --> 00:46:14.770
Oh. how do we feel
about less loud?

841
00:46:14.906 --> 00:46:16.472
Sorry. babe.

842
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.815
I don't think I can be on a
boat right now. to be honest.

843
00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:20.317
Come on. it'll be fun.

844
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:22.474
- Big old bucket of worms.
- Oh.

845
00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.214
Maybe we'll just have
some girl time.

846
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:28.886
You guys go
be with the worms.

847
00:46:29.021 --> 00:46:30.885

- Of course.

848
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.287

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:33.904
Tom. is that

850
00:46:33.928 --> 00:46:35.002
- Yep.

851
00:46:35.026 --> 00:46:36.357

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:38.623
Bye. babe!

Oh. I needed this!

854
00:46:42.902 --> 00:46:44.936
- Me the fuck too.

855
00:46:45.071 --> 00:46:47.366

856
00:46:47.502 --> 00:46:49.038

Thank you.

861
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.110
Where's Jess?

862
00:47:00.246 --> 00:47:02.182
What do you mean?

863
00:47:02.318 --> 00:47:04.088
What do you mean.
"What do I mean?"

864
00:47:06.855 --> 00:47:08.191
Jess.

865
00:47:13.192 --> 00:47:15.099
Who is Jess?

866
00:47:20.902 --> 00:47:22.205
You okay?

867
00:47:24.577 --> 00:47:26.341
Is she okay?

868
00:47:27.774 --> 00:47:29.912
You don't look so good.
What's wrong?

869
00:47:30.048 --> 00:47:31.511
Yeah. what's wrong?

870
00:47:34.853 --> 00:47:36.351
Are you fucking with me?

871
00:47:38.386 --> 00:47:40.058
- Where's Jess?
- Huh? What. hon?

872
00:47:40.193 --> 00:47:41.863
My friend that was
in the room next to mine.

873
00:47:41.887 --> 00:47:44.524
Uh. the storage room?

874
00:47:45.759 --> 00:47:47.993
Hey. relax.
You're on vacation.

875
00:47:48.128 --> 00:47:49.430
Oh. Jesus.

876
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.678
Wake up!

877
00:48:08.851 --> 00:48:10.380
Wake up!

878
00:48:10.516 --> 00:48:13.289
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

879
00:48:44.856 --> 00:48:46.321
Jess was here.

880
00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:47.992
- Jess was here!
- Hmm.

881
00:48:48.127 --> 00:48:49.653
And she said...
She said

882
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:51.268
there was something wrong
with this place.

883
00:48:51.292 --> 00:48:52.493
I hear you.

884
00:48:54.433 --> 00:48:57.333
And I don't want to sound
like... like a bitch.

885
00:48:58.534 --> 00:49:01.637
It's just. like.
I feel like I would know

886
00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.704
if there was. like. this whole
other person here. you know?

887
00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:07.209
I know
it doesn't make any sense.

888
00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.981
It doesn't make
any sense. but...

889
00:49:09.116 --> 00:49:10.423
I feel like...
I feel like

890
00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:12.579
we're forgetting.
like. a lot of stuff.

891
00:49:12.715 --> 00:49:16.649
How do we feel about
putting down the knife?

892
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:19.789
Yeah?

893
00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:22.620
Yeah. I'm sorry.

894
00:49:22.756 --> 00:49:25.163
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

895
00:49:26.899 --> 00:49:27.899
It's okay.

896
00:49:27.997 --> 00:49:29.266
I'm sorry.

897
00:49:31.797 --> 00:49:33.237
What day is it?

898
00:49:34.233 --> 00:49:35.437
Huh?

899
00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.638
Do you know what day it is?

900
00:49:40.745 --> 00:49:41.745
No.

901
00:49:43.976 --> 00:49:46.349
But. like. I never know
what day it is.

902
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.620
Right.

903
00:49:50.056 --> 00:49:52.157
I'm having a great time here.

904
00:49:56.797 --> 00:49:58.229
But I also have this

905
00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.627
feeling that I'm. like...

906
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.598
not.

907
00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:09.005
- Does that make sense?
- Yes.

908
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.220
I have dirt under my nails.

909
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.737
and I don't know
how it got there.

910
00:50:12.872 --> 00:50:15.213
I'm sorry.
What is this?

911
00:50:16.112 --> 00:50:17.446
What is that?

912
00:50:17.582 --> 00:50:19.154
They were like...
"Oh. Sarah...

913
00:50:19.178 --> 00:50:21.547
you were climbing up a tree
and you were so wasted.

914
00:50:21.683 --> 00:50:23.118
you fell."
Uh-mmm.

915
00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.519
I didn't last eight seasons

916
00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:26.858
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes</i>
because I fell.

917
00:50:26.994 --> 00:50:28.259
So you don't think I'm crazy?

918
00:50:28.394 --> 00:50:31.129
What's crazy is that
we got onto a plane

919
00:50:31.264 --> 00:50:33.492
with a bunch of dudes
we don't know.

920
00:50:33.627 --> 00:50:35.400
I thought
you all knew each other.

921
00:50:35.536 --> 00:50:36.536
No.

922
00:50:39.834 --> 00:50:42.734
Cody just chatted me up
at a coffee shop.

923
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:45.241
just talking about
how he knew Slater King.

924
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:47.241
But Heather and Camilla.

925
00:50:47.376 --> 00:50:48.543
they know everybody. right?

926
00:50:50.718 --> 00:50:51.843
I don't know.

927
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.388
Oh. my God!

928
00:51:01.524 --> 00:51:02.927
What the fuck
were we thinking?

929
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:04.530
- Oh. fuck!
- I knew it!

930
00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:05.731
I knew it!

931
00:51:05.866 --> 00:51:06.866
I knew it! I knew it!

932
00:51:06.959 --> 00:51:08.397
I knew it was
too good to be true.

933
00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:10.092
Of course they're fucking
with our heads

934
00:51:10.135 --> 00:51:11.534
because that's what they do.

935
00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:14.702
They distract us with
these cute little outfits.

936
00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:18.743
and they shower us with
raspberries and champagne.

937
00:51:18.878 --> 00:51:19.878
But you know what?

938
00:51:19.939 --> 00:51:21.946
We know
what's really going on.

939
00:51:22.082 --> 00:51:24.248
They are trying to control us.

940
00:51:24.383 --> 00:51:27.384
They're trying
to make us look crazy.

941
00:51:33.992 --> 00:51:35.194
And it's working.

942
00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:41.794
So they're making us forget.

943
00:51:42.768 --> 00:51:43.800
Yeah.

944
00:51:43.936 --> 00:51:44.962
Okay. but like...

945
00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:46.903
how?

946
00:51:51.946 --> 00:51:53.476
"Forgetting is a gift."

947
00:51:55.374 --> 00:51:56.577
Huh?

948
00:51:56.712 --> 00:51:59.812
Slater said.
"Forgetting is a gift."

949
00:52:00.786 --> 00:52:01.946
Oh...

950
00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:06.858
I don't get it.

951
00:52:16.464 --> 00:52:17.865
We need to call the cops.

952
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:19.070
Yes.

953
00:52:19.206 --> 00:52:20.732
- We need to call the FBI.
- Yes.

954
00:52:20.868 --> 00:52:23.005
We need to call the cops
and the FBI.

955
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.140
Okay. but wait.

956
00:52:24.176 --> 00:52:26.278
- What?
- Wait. wait.

957
00:52:26.413 --> 00:52:27.921
Say we call the cops
and the FBI. right?

958
00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:29.039
Uh-huh...

959
00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:31.543
And we're. like.
"Hi. Hello. Please send help.

960
00:52:31.678 --> 00:52:32.798
"Slater King and his buddies

961
00:52:32.912 --> 00:52:34.847
are doing
horrible things to us."

962
00:52:34.982 --> 00:52:37.253
They're gonna be like.
"What did they do?"

963
00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:38.983
And we're gonna be like.
"Um...

964
00:52:39.893 --> 00:52:40.985
We don't know."

965
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.831
"'Cause they've been
secretly erasing memories

966
00:52:42.855 --> 00:52:44.855
with perfume. I guess."

967
00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:47.161
And the guys
would be like. "What?"

968
00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:48.564
"We would never do that.

969
00:52:48.699 --> 00:52:50.039
other white guys
we probably play golf with."

970
00:52:50.063 --> 00:52:51.311
And Heather and Camilla
will be like.

971
00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:52.634
"Nothing but good times

972
00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.571
and fat fucking blunts
over here. officer."

973
00:52:54.706 --> 00:52:57.404
And I'll be like.
"Come on. guys. believe women."

974
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.805
"Here is my friend's lighter."

975
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.589
And they'll be like.
"Sure thing. Of course."

976
00:53:00.613 --> 00:53:02.875
"You crazy fucking bitch."

977
00:53:04.478 --> 00:53:06.084
Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.383
- Look at me.
- Okay.

979
00:53:07.519 --> 00:53:08.758
- Let's get on the same page.
- Okay.

980
00:53:08.782 --> 00:53:10.317
Your friend. you remember her?

981
00:53:10.452 --> 00:53:11.688
Yes.

982
00:53:12.391 --> 00:53:14.656
- But I don't remember her.
- No.

983
00:53:15.989 --> 00:53:18.330
What's up with that?

984
00:53:21.299 --> 00:53:22.664
She got bit by a snake.

985
00:53:24.338 --> 00:53:26.371
Okay?

986
00:53:27.875 --> 00:53:29.033
And I drank this.

987
00:53:30.008 --> 00:53:31.473
What's in there?

988
00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:32.905
I'm pretty sure
it's snake venom.

989
00:53:34.339 --> 00:53:37.107
You think snake venom's
gonna make us remember?

990
00:53:37.476 --> 00:53:38.680
Yeah.

991
00:53:40.479 --> 00:53:41.683
Fuck it.

992
00:53:46.125 --> 00:53:47.689
- Yeah.
- Oh. God!

993
00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.459
- It's really bad.
- Oh. that's... That's venom?

994
00:53:50.595 --> 00:53:52.394
- Yeah. dude.
- Why didn't you warn me?

995
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:54.192
- I did.
- That is disgusting.

996
00:53:54.328 --> 00:53:56.933
How are we gonna get Heather
and Camilla to drink that?

997
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:58.865
Oh. man.

998
00:53:59.905 --> 00:54:00.905
Tequila?

999
00:54:02.438 --> 00:54:04.875
Shots. bitches!

1000
00:54:14.949 --> 00:54:17.587
- Holy shit!
- What's in these?

1001
00:54:18.353 --> 00:54:19.523
Snake venom?

1002
00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.863
Slam it. girlfriends.

1003
00:54:31.499 --> 00:54:32.998
I used to slam it.

1004
00:54:40.211 --> 00:54:41.345
Fuck! No way.

1005
00:54:41.481 --> 00:54:42.961
that was fucking crazy!

1006
00:54:43.082 --> 00:54:44.742
Tangy.

1007
00:54:44.877 --> 00:54:46.584
Fuck!

1008
00:54:46.719 --> 00:54:50.819
Stan. uh. radioed. by the way.
on the. um. thingy

1009
00:54:50.955 --> 00:54:54.284
that the boys are gonna be
back soon from fishing.

1010
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.093
which means that I had
better...

1011
00:54:57.229 --> 00:54:58.395
Okay.

1012
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:01.493
- Goodbye. ladies.
- Bye. Stace.

1013
00:55:01.628 --> 00:55:02.862
Oh. yes!

1014
00:55:02.998 --> 00:55:04.313
I'm going for the phones.
Keep a lookout.

1015
00:55:04.337 --> 00:55:05.468
- Okay. Wait. wait.
- Okay.

1016
00:55:05.604 --> 00:55:07.138
What do I do
when the boys come back?

1017
00:55:07.274 --> 00:55:09.571
I don't know. Fucking yell...

1018
00:55:09.707 --> 00:55:11.739
"fat blunts"
as loud as you can.

1019
00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.504
- Okay.
- Don't forget to smile.

1020
00:55:13.639 --> 00:55:15.011
Fat blunts.

1021
00:55:15.146 --> 00:55:16.146
More shots?

1022
00:55:17.444 --> 00:55:18.945
Yeah.

1023
00:55:47.172 --> 00:55:48.579
Wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1024
00:55:55.122 --> 00:55:55.913
Fuck!

1025
00:55:56.048 --> 00:55:57.588
Bad bitches for life.

1026
00:55:57.724 --> 00:55:59.334
- Bad bitches for life.
- Wait. No. wait.

1027
00:55:59.358 --> 00:56:00.723
- Oh!
- You dropped it!

1028
00:56:02.923 --> 00:56:04.892
Oh. God!

1029
00:56:08.902 --> 00:56:09.902
Oh. fuck.

1030
00:56:10.629 --> 00:56:11.800
Wait.

1031
00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:13.571
Sarah?

1032
00:56:13.707 --> 00:56:16.101
Dude. you... what happened
to your nose. man?

1033
00:56:20.806 --> 00:56:22.207
Hey. girls...

1034
00:56:22.342 --> 00:56:25.343
maybe we should
cool it on the shots.

1035
00:56:25.478 --> 00:56:28.051
Just trust me. I think...
I think they're really strong.

1036
00:56:29.248 --> 00:56:31.220
I'm. like.
really hardcore. so...

1037
00:56:31.356 --> 00:56:32.554
Just give it to me.

1038
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:34.020
- No. Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Give it.

1039
00:56:34.156 --> 00:56:36.191
Come on. <i>mami.</i>
Just worry about yourself.

1040
00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.326
We got this.

1041
00:56:42.668 --> 00:56:44.569
Oh. look. look. look.

1042
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:54.445
- Fuck!
- Oh. fuck!

1043
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.680
What the fuck. babe?
It's just me!

1044
00:57:02.718 --> 00:57:03.838
I'm sorry.

1045
00:57:03.919 --> 00:57:05.188
I just don't like
to be tickled.

1046
00:57:05.324 --> 00:57:06.617
Ooh. bro!

1047
00:57:06.752 --> 00:57:08.219
Fuck! Fuck!

1048
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:11.563
Come on. Come on.

1049
00:57:15.197 --> 00:57:18.668
When I was. like. four.
my sister. she pushed me.

1050
00:57:18.803 --> 00:57:20.366
Um. accidentally.
She's not a sociopath.

1051
00:57:20.501 --> 00:57:24.136
And my two front teeth just
shot right back up into their.

1052
00:57:24.805 --> 00:57:26.341
uh. the tooth holes.

1053
00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:27.777
It was disgusting.

1054
00:57:27.912 --> 00:57:30.314
But they were baby teeth.
so they grew back.

1055
00:57:30.449 --> 00:57:31.558
Are you all right?

1056
00:57:31.582 --> 00:57:32.782
Sorry. how's your nose?

1057
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:37.981
Where's Frida?

1058
00:57:38.117 --> 00:57:39.958
Uh. she's just freshening up.

1059
00:57:41.387 --> 00:57:44.060
All right.
I'll see y'all in a minute.

1060
00:57:44.195 --> 00:57:45.195
Wait!

1061
00:57:45.658 --> 00:57:46.862
Hmm?

1062
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.795
We're just gonna

1063
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:52.637
smoke a... fat blunt!

1064
00:57:53.739 --> 00:57:55.166
Go off. queen!

1065
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:58.709
Yep! We're gonna smoke
a big. fat blunt!

1066
00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:04.346
Okay.

1067
00:58:05.484 --> 00:58:06.484
Okay.

1068
00:58:06.615 --> 00:58:08.550
Let's fucking go!

1069
00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.215
Oh. I can't wait!

1070
00:58:17.563 --> 00:58:19.322
We've got ourselves

1071
00:58:19.458 --> 00:58:22.293
a sticky situation.

1072
00:58:25.302 --> 00:58:26.605
Yeah.

1073
00:58:29.735 --> 00:58:30.939
Come on.

1074
00:58:31.803 --> 00:58:32.976
Fuck!

1075
00:58:37.683 --> 00:58:38.923
What's up. guys?

1076
00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:40.019
Yo.

1077
00:58:42.481 --> 00:58:44.320
Does anyone
have a lighter?

1078
00:58:44.456 --> 00:58:45.855
Are you okay. babe?

1079
00:58:47.093 --> 00:58:48.191
Yeah.

1080
00:58:48.327 --> 00:58:49.519
Yeah. I'm just

1081
00:58:49.654 --> 00:58:53.258
really excited about this...
fat blunt.

1082
00:59:01.406 --> 00:59:02.740
Me too.

1083
00:59:07.776 --> 00:59:09.208
Fuck! Shit!

1084
01:00:54.647 --> 01:00:57.888
What are we
gonna do about you?

1085
01:00:58.587 --> 01:00:59.791
Hmm?

1086
01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:05.291
What are we gonna do?

1087
01:01:09.797 --> 01:01:11.000
It's...

1088
01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:14.503
weird here.

1089
01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:15.638
Doesn't work here.

1090
01:01:15.707 --> 01:01:16.769
- Stace...
- Huh?

1091
01:01:16.905 --> 01:01:18.404
...is it weird here?

1092
01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.339
No. I. uh. I like it there.
I like it right there.

1093
01:01:22.475 --> 01:01:24.541
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Stan?

1094
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:27.913
- It's a little weird.
- Right?

1095
01:01:29.383 --> 01:01:32.087
I concur.
Bitches be trippin'.

1096
01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:33.735
Does anyone
want any champagne?

1097
01:01:33.759 --> 01:01:34.833
But then. let's love 'em.

1098
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.362
Wait. You didn't get any.

1099
01:01:37.497 --> 01:01:39.391
Go again. girl. Here.

1100
01:01:40.534 --> 01:01:41.998
Crazy times. man.

1101
01:01:47.707 --> 01:01:50.370
That's what I'm talking about.

1102
01:01:50.505 --> 01:01:52.877
It's comfy.
but it just... I don't know.

1103
01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:57.646
Is it too red? I feel like
it's a little too red.

1104
01:02:12.257 --> 01:02:13.798
You could help.

1105
01:02:13.934 --> 01:02:15.793
I'm fucking eating here.

1106
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.341
Somebody's getting a dick
drawn on his forehead tonight.

1107
01:02:19.365 --> 01:02:20.805
- What?
- Nothing.

1108
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.970
Stop moving. babe.

1109
01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:25.170
stop moving!

1110
01:02:25.305 --> 01:02:26.585
Are we doing this.
or what?

1111
01:02:26.672 --> 01:02:28.343
Damn it.
this is so fucked up!

1112
01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:30.714
Shut up. She got bit.
She remembers everything.

1113
01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:32.547
- No. no.
- No. no. no!

1114
01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:42.056
Yeah. Okay.

1115
01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.824
Let's. uh.
let's get rid of it.

1116
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.526
You want it? Stace?

1117
01:02:46.661 --> 01:02:48.570
- Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.
- How about you take it?

1118
01:02:48.594 --> 01:02:50.935
Oh. I'm an idiot!
Stan. give me a hand.

1119
01:02:52.172 --> 01:02:54.267
I can't believe that
I didn't think of this before.

1120
01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.018
It was sitting right there
the entire time.

1121
01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:57.642
right in front of my face.

1122
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:00.611
Okay.

1123
01:03:05.077 --> 01:03:07.182
Wait. Okay.

1124
01:03:08.516 --> 01:03:10.618
Now. why didn't we
just do here first?

1125
01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:20.195
Frida!

1126
01:03:21.295 --> 01:03:22.962
Hey. Frida!

Oh!

01:03:32.741 --> 01:03:34.204
Yeah!

1133
01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.776

1134
01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.281

Okay.

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.687
So how did the phones go?

1140
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.064
Bad.

1141
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.632
It went very bad.

1142
01:03:58.767 --> 01:04:00.066
Okay.

1143
01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:01.937
Has your venom kicked in yet?

1144
01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.068
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:04:04.204 --> 01:04:05.504
Heather and Camilla?

1146
01:04:05.639 --> 01:04:07.743
Those bitches are
a ticking fucking time bomb.

1147

What?

1151
01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:15.119
We saw what they did to Jess.

1152
01:04:15.254 --> 01:04:17.059

- Yeah.

1154
01:04:20.688 --> 01:04:23.258
They killed her
'cause she wasn't forgetting.

1155
01:04:26.393 --> 01:04:28.296
This one is for you.

1156
01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:31.128

Hi... you.

1161
01:04:45.411 --> 01:04:47.447

1162
01:04:48.521 --> 01:04:49.614

1163
01:04:49.749 --> 01:04:51.495
Aw. I missed you too.

1164

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:40.883
"Oh. word?
Say less. Send the addy."

1253
01:08:40.914 --> 01:08:42.728
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause I'm from Dyckman.

1254
01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:46.257
And I lead with so much
love...

1255
01:08:46.392 --> 01:08:48.290
But I'm quick to fuck
a motherfucker up.

1256
01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:49.989

1260
01:09:00.299 --> 01:09:01.435

1261
01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:02.783

1264
01:09:12.451 --> 01:09:16.052
It's been great. Yeah. Yeah.

1265
01:09:16.188 --> 01:09:17.550
It's just always been

1266
01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:19.355
hard for me
to make girlfriends.

1267
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:21.424
- so it's been nice.
- Hmm. Oh.

1268

Yeah.

1270
01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.365

1271
01:09:29.901 --> 01:09:31.196
Yeah. babe.

1272
01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:32.534
Um...

1273
01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.272
Well...

1274
01:09:35.268 --> 01:09:36.968
Women

1275
01:09:37.103 --> 01:09:39.141
have been taught to
compete against each other.

1276
01:09:39.277 --> 01:09:40.937
- Right?
- Hmm.

1277
01:09:41.072 --> 01:09:43.077
When really
we should be helping...

1278
01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.745
I mean. supporting

1279
01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.417
each other. So. I don't know.

1280
01:09:48.552 --> 01:09:50.317
I've just
been thinking

1281
01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:53.851
that maybe when I get home.

1282
01:09:53.987 --> 01:09:55.233
that it would be nice
to start. like.

1283
01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.558
this program thing

1284
01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.825
where I. like.
teach women survival skills.

1285
01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:02.662
And I know that show was
stupid and totally degrading.

1286
01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:05.632
but I learned some
really useful shit.

1287
01:10:05.767 --> 01:10:07.241
And the truth is.
is that you never know

1288
01:10:07.265 --> 01:10:09.011
when you're gonna be stuck
in the middle of nowhere

1289
01:10:09.035 --> 01:10:11.138
in. like. a totally
terrifying situation

1290
01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:12.472
with no one to save you.

1291
01:10:12.607 --> 01:10:14.274
no one to even
hear you scream.

1292
01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:15.642
and you need to fight

1293
01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:17.338
for your fucking life!

1294
01:10:24.122 --> 01:10:25.818
'Cause it's scary...

1295
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.723
out there.

1296
01:10:39.367 --> 01:10:40.569
Yeah.

1297
01:10:41.532 --> 01:10:42.532
It so is.

1298
01:10:44.069 --> 01:10:45.838
It is terrifying.

1299
01:10:46.672 --> 01:10:48.373
I just got so excited.

1300
01:10:48.509 --> 01:10:50.007
No. I do the same thing.

1301
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:55.648
Yeah. it really is.

1302
01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:57.224
You know.
my cousin's wife got mugged

1303
01:10:57.255 --> 01:10:58.648

1304
01:10:58.784 --> 01:11:00.190
- Oh. my God!
- You see?

1305
01:11:00.325 --> 01:11:02.059
- Is she okay?
- No.

1306
01:11:02.195 --> 01:11:03.889
You know what's great. though?

1307
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.193
Just women.

1308
01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:07.626
when they band together.

1309
01:11:07.762 --> 01:11:09.664

1310
01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:14.933

1318
01:11:43.528 --> 01:11:44.732
No.

1319
01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:51.301
All right.

1320
01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:53.441

01:20:07.438 --> 01:20:08.569
Guys?

1431
01:20:10.735 --> 01:20:13.438
Guys. we need the hospital.

1432
01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.906
Oh. fuck. I need a hospital.

1433
01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:17.176
Fuck!

1434
01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.277
Oh. my God!

1435
01:20:19.413 --> 01:20:20.893
They know. dude.
They know everything.

1436
01:20:21.018 --> 01:20:22.258
We're gonna go to hell
for this.

1437
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:23.457
What do you mean?
We're such nice guys.

1438
01:20:23.481 --> 01:20:25.322
- Drink this.
- Oh. my God!

1439
01:20:25.457 --> 01:20:26.935
- You got perfumed. dude.
- What does that mean?

1440
01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:28.366
That's why
you don't remember.

1441
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.663
- What does that mean?
- Guys?

1442
01:20:29.687 --> 01:20:31.092
Will someone
please tell me

1443
01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:32.472
what the fuck's going on?

1444
01:20:35.533 --> 01:20:36.533
Guys?

1445
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:40.531
Guys?

1446
01:21:11.602 --> 01:21:12.602
Red rabbit.

1447
01:21:16.534 --> 01:21:18.039
I don't understand.

1448
01:21:18.175 --> 01:21:19.575
I am not...
You go out there.

1449
01:21:19.606 --> 01:21:21.543
Okay. stop!
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1450
01:21:21.678 --> 01:21:22.678
You can do this.

1451
01:21:22.706 --> 01:21:23.943
I don't like
this game anymore.

1452
01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.119
Hey. Come here. Come here.

1453
01:21:25.177 --> 01:21:26.344
Just go outside

1454
01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.414
- and go get the girls.
- All right.

1455
01:21:30.016 --> 01:21:31.016
Fuck.

1456
01:21:31.116 --> 01:21:32.319
It's okay.

1457
01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:35.256
You're just...

1458
01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:38.094
remembering.

1459
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:42.197
But I... I didn't...

1460
01:21:43.861 --> 01:21:46.463
I didn't want to remember!

1461
01:21:46.599 --> 01:21:49.364
They're gonna do
what they're gonna do.

1462
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.333
You child.

1463
01:21:51.469 --> 01:21:54.242
Forgetting is a gift. hon.

1464
01:22:05.657 --> 01:22:07.651
Help me. Help me.

1465
01:22:08.352 --> 01:22:09.752
Bitch. I tried.

1466
01:22:19.197 --> 01:22:20.400
Who's there?

1467
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.337
It's just me. babe.

1468
01:22:28.845 --> 01:22:30.047
Here.

1469
01:22:37.689 --> 01:22:39.287
What did I do?

1470
01:22:44.463 --> 01:22:45.491
Nothing.

1471
01:22:46.259 --> 01:22:47.458
Thank God!

1472
01:22:47.594 --> 01:22:49.231
No. no. no.
I meant. you did...

1473
01:22:50.327 --> 01:22:51.530
you did nothing.

1474
01:22:52.905 --> 01:22:54.566
You did nothing for yourself.

1475
01:22:56.269 --> 01:22:57.833
You did nothing for them.

1476
01:23:02.781 --> 01:23:04.443
And. in my opinion.

1477
01:23:04.578 --> 01:23:06.711
there's a real special place
in hell

1478
01:23:06.846 --> 01:23:10.120
reserved for people that
just choose to do nothing.

1479
01:23:13.752 --> 01:23:15.653
Why do you think
you chose to do nothing?

1480
01:23:33.811 --> 01:23:35.343
What the fuck?

1481
01:23:39.445 --> 01:23:40.565
This is impossible unless...

1482
01:23:40.612 --> 01:23:42.350
I've been here before.

1483
01:23:50.795 --> 01:23:51.854
What do we do?

1484
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:55.495

01:24:30.167 --> 01:24:31.331
Oh. is he gonna do something?

1501
01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:32.874
I don't know
what's happening.

1502
01:24:32.898 --> 01:24:34.864
Everyone's fucking crazy
out here. Please help me!

1503
01:24:34.999 --> 01:24:36.412
Are you gonna do something.

1504
01:24:36.436 --> 01:24:38.505
Slater. I'm scared!

1505
01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.208
Don't open the door.

1506
01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:42.644
Don't open the door. Okay.

1507
01:24:52.089 --> 01:24:53.619
Shit!

1508
01:24:57.389 --> 01:24:58.793
I'm really sorry.

1509
01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:01.963
Look at you.

1510
01:25:03.068 --> 01:25:05.165
- Please!
- You're beautiful.

1511
01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.465
Come here. Come here. Stop.

1512
01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.832
Stop. stop.
It's okay. All right?

1513
01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:13.309
Hi.

1514
01:25:19.046 --> 01:25:20.079
Hi.

1515
01:25:26.419 --> 01:25:28.890
Yeah. It's good there.

1516
01:26:02.489 --> 01:26:04.261
I like your nails.

1517
01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.958
That's gonna scar.

1518
01:26:16.734 --> 01:26:17.901
You havin' a good time?

1519
01:26:20.374 --> 01:26:21.374
I'm having a great...

1520
01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:25.414
Hi.

1521
01:26:27.512 --> 01:26:29.011
Welcome back.

1522
01:26:32.352 --> 01:26:33.856
Fucking bitch.

1523
01:26:33.991 --> 01:26:35.892
Ah... Fuck him.

1524
01:26:36.027 --> 01:26:37.327
Don't worry about him.

1525
01:26:37.462 --> 01:26:39.102
He's just still mad
about the pinky thing.

1526
01:26:40.864 --> 01:26:41.864
Fuck!

1527
01:26:41.927 --> 01:26:43.462
I thought last year
was intense.

1528
01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.197
but you've really
outdone yourself.

1529
01:26:51.809 --> 01:26:52.837
So...

1530
01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.741
everybody's dead.

1531
01:26:57.749 --> 01:26:59.210
What now?

1532
01:26:59.345 --> 01:27:00.879
I'm just saying.

1533
01:27:01.014 --> 01:27:03.986
there is a version of this
where we're all just

1534
01:27:04.121 --> 01:27:05.718
still havin' a good time.

1535
01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:09.524
And sipping mimosas
and green juices.

1536
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:13.059
And laughing at brunch.

1537
01:27:14.598 --> 01:27:16.427
'Cause brunch.
brunch is real.

1538
01:27:16.563 --> 01:27:18.797
Brunch is so fucking real.

1539
01:27:21.206 --> 01:27:23.065
You want to know
what's not real?

1540
01:27:30.277 --> 01:27:31.539
Forgiveness.

1541
01:27:31.675 --> 01:27:33.179
I'll show you.

1542
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:36.622
I. Slater King. would like
to formally apologize

1543
01:27:36.646 --> 01:27:37.915
for my behavior.

1544
01:27:38.584 --> 01:27:40.051
I've sought therapy.

1545
01:27:40.186 --> 01:27:41.799
and I'm gonna take a leave
of absence from my company

1546
01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:44.988
while I face these issues
head-on. I'm sorry.

1547
01:27:48.867 --> 01:27:49.993
I'm sorry.

1548
01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:52.963
I'm sorry.

1549
01:27:55.974 --> 01:27:57.407
I'm sorry. I'm...

1550
01:27:58.977 --> 01:28:01.037
I'm... I'm sorry.

1551
01:28:01.979 --> 01:28:03.512
I'm sorry.

1552
01:28:08.381 --> 01:28:09.782
I'm sorry.

1553
01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:13.020
I'm sorry!

1554
01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:14.483
I'm sorry!

1555
01:28:14.618 --> 01:28:16.089
I'm sorry!

1556
01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:17.486
I'm sorry!

1557
01:28:17.621 --> 01:28:18.993
I'm sorry!

1558
01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:20.324
I'm sorry!

1559
01:28:20.459 --> 01:28:21.765
I'm sorry!

1560
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:22.900
I'm sorry!

1561
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I'm sorry!

1562
01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:25.133
I'm sorry!

1563
01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.264
I'm sorry!

1564
01:28:26.399 --> 01:28:27.399
I'm sorry!

1565
01:28:27.466 --> 01:28:28.497
I'm sorry!

1566
01:28:28.632 --> 01:28:30.099
I'm sorry!

1567
01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:36.843
So. we good?

1568
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:40.081
No?

1569
01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:42.782
That's right.

1570
01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:49.426
There is no forgiveness.

1571
01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:53.126
There's just

1572
01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:55.063
forgetting.

1573
01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:56.730
There's just forgetting.

1574
01:28:59.297 --> 01:29:01.733
Which. by the way.
you are fucking incredible at.

1575
01:29:01.869 --> 01:29:04.237
You forgot about
the entire goddamn place.

1576
01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.372
That's amazing.

1577
01:29:05.441 --> 01:29:06.561
Imagine what humans could be

1578
01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:09.975
capable of if we could
free them

1579
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:13.582
from the suffering
and the pain of their trauma.

1580
01:29:13.718 --> 01:29:16.886
Oh. my God. my sister.
my sister would be...

1581
01:29:17.022 --> 01:29:18.081
she'd be free.

1582
01:29:18.216 --> 01:29:20.015
She'd be free
'cause she's so fucked up.

1583
01:29:20.151 --> 01:29:21.756
because she remembers
everything.

1584
01:29:21.891 --> 01:29:24.186
She remembers every
single thing. She's. like...

1585
01:29:24.322 --> 01:29:26.662
"How could you go and
play tennis with that man

1586
01:29:26.797 --> 01:29:28.557
after what he did to us
when we were little?"

1587
01:29:28.692 --> 01:29:30.667
And I'm. like...

1588
01:29:30.802 --> 01:29:33.496
I'm over here just.
like. "What did he do?"

1589
01:29:33.632 --> 01:29:35.104
"What did he do?"

1590
01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:36.898
"What the fuck did he do?"

1591
01:29:37.033 --> 01:29:38.772
"I don't know what he did."

1592
01:29:47.813 --> 01:29:49.415
This is gonna be great.

1593
01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:54.387
We can forget
all of this.

1594
01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:57.124
Come on. Me and you both.

1595
01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:58.594
Let's just...

1596
01:30:00.924 --> 01:30:02.862
Just a quick spritz.

1597
01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:06.528
What do you think?

1598
01:30:06.664 --> 01:30:07.867
Well...

1599
01:30:10.067 --> 01:30:11.567
I feel...

1600
01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:15.304
Fuck!

1601
01:30:15.439 --> 01:30:17.322
- I feel like...
- Okay. um...

1602
01:30:17.346 --> 01:30:19.142
Hold that thought.

1603
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:21.650
I'm gonna be right back.

1604
01:30:22.785 --> 01:30:24.286
I want to hear
what you want to say.

1605
01:30:24.422 --> 01:30:25.622
I'm gonna be right back. okay?

1606
01:31:02.922 --> 01:31:04.202
Hey.

1607
01:31:04.656 --> 01:31:05.991

You're right.
There is no forgiveness.

1643
01:33:02.345 --> 01:33:03.438
Only forgetting.

1644
01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:18.728
Fucking...

You sure you know

1650
01:35:06.766 --> 01:35:08.435

Not here.
