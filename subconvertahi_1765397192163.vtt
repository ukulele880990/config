00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:17.434
Hey.

3
00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.771
I know you're scared.
and I know you're angry.

4
00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.274
but I promise you.
we are here to help you.

5
00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.818
Hey. Derek. Derek.

6
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.279
If you keep doing that.
you're gonna hurt yourself.

7
00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.782
Just calm down so we can talk. okay?

8
00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.119
Do you know who I am?

9
00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.829
An evil child kidnapper.

10
00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.875
Okay. I understand
why you would think that.

11
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.002
but I'm not evil.

12
00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.505
I'm just a mom. a regular mom.

13
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.758
That's my son. Will.

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.384
Zombie boy.

15
00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.303
You know why they call him that?

16
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.555
Because he died and came back to life.

17
00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:59.225
But what people don't know is
that when he went missing.

18
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.229
he was taken by a terrible. scary monster.

19
00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.566
And now. that scary monster is after you.

20
00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.278
Yeah. I know. Mr. Whatsit told me.
which is why you need to let me go.

21
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.823
No. no. Mr. Whatsit is not
who he says he is. okay?

22
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.202
He is lying to you.
All these monsters. they work for him.

23
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.706
That's why we took you here to this barn.
We thought this barn was safe.

24
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.790
but he's found us.

25
00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.584
So we have to move you again.
somewhere he can't find you.

26
00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:28.630
So if I untie you.
will you cooperate and come with us?

27
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.299
Please?

28
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.468
Okay. great.

29
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.597
You're a very brave kid. Derek.
I want you to know that.

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.099
Very...

31
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.567
-Let me go! Get off of me!
-Derek. Please!

32
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.528
-The door! Get the door!
-Help me!

33
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.279
Let me go! Get off me!

34
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.949
-Stay down!
-Get away!

35
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.827
Somebody help! I'm being kidnapped!

36
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.037
Get away from me! Let me go!

37
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.133
Mom. the rope! I need the rope!

38
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.626
-Let me go! Eat dirt!
-Ah!

39
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.172
Come try us. dipshit!

40
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.215
Shit!

41
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.687
Dude! She's not lying to you. okay?

42
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.190
Mr. Whatsit is a very bad guy.
He sent the monsters after you.

43
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.817
Suck my fat one!

44
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.110
Jesus! What?

45
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.445
You just signed
your death warrant. dipshit!

46
00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.406
You're a psycho. and you're going to jail!

47
00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.992
-There is a monster coming!
-We're trying to help you.

48
00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.827
-La. la. la. la.
-Derek. please!

49
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.120
You gotta come down.

50
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.205
I'm not listening. La. la. la. la.

51
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.855
Stay back!

52
00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.367
You want him.
you're gonna have to come through me!

53
00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.229
Yeah. we got him! We got him!

54
00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.332
It flipped! It's headed back towards us!

55
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.501
Come on. What are you doing. man?
We gotta turn around!

56
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.545
Wait. Gates are like
Peanut Butter Boppers. right?

57
00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.506
-What?
-The outside is. like. crunchy and tough.

58
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.134
But bite down on it.
it gives way to a gooey. creamy core.

59
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.011
Dude. what the hell are you talking about?

60
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.638
I drive fast enough.
the beamer can punch a hole into the gate.

61
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:26.933
and then we can track the Demo
on its home turf in the Upside Down.

62
00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:29.060
-Follow it back home.
-We're losing the signal!

63
00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:31.062
We won't be able to follow anything
if we crash!

64
00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.772
We won't crash if it's like a Bopper!

65
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:33.773
It's almost gone!

66
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.610
Do it.

67
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.825
-Oh my God! Oh my God!
-Jesus.

68
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.054
-Oh my God! Oh my God!
-I got it! I got it!

69
00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.620
Oh God. no!

70
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.539
-It's not gonna work.
-We're not gonna make it!

71
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.583
-It's not a Bopper. Stop!
-Slow down! Jesus Christ!

72
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.836
-Shit! Oh my God!
-Hang on!

73
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.554
We did it! Woo!

74
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.974
Signal?

75
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.102
-Strong!
-Oh my God!

76
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.896
We got you. son of a bitch! We got you!

77
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.456
Will!? Will!

78
00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.168
I'm right here. Will.

79
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.794
It's okay.

80
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.963
I got you. I got you.

81
00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:43.801
I got you. sweetie.

82
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.368
{\an8}<i>Uh. hockety-pockety?</i>

83
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.745
<i>Oh. yes. yes. that's right.</i>

84
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.914
<i>♪ Hockety-pockety wockety wack
Odds and ends and bric-a-brac ♪</i>

85
00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.833
<i>-I'll be with you in just a minute. son.
-What?</i>

86
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.334
<i>Packing's almost done!</i>

87
00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:02.922
Shush!

88
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.425
Jelly!

89
00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:12.932
Alan Miller?

90
00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:15.226
I'm sorry.
what is this about?

91
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:17.854
It's your daughter. sir.

92
00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.179
Our boy's taking us on a shortcut
through Roane Cemetery.

93
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.807
-That's almost at the county line.
-Doesn't this thing get tired?

94
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.185
Unfortunately. it looks like the opposite.
I think he's speeding up.

95
00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.936
-What?
-I'm losing the signal.

96
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.230
You've gotta be shitting me!

97
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.874
-Can you go faster?
-Let's see.

98
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.820
Henderson. you've gotta talk to me.
What do you got?

99
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.031
-Henderson. what...
-I'm picking up interference.

100
00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:12.492
-How is that important?
-It means I can't hear the signal.

101
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.160
-Listen harder.
-What do you mean?

102
00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:15.995
-You wanna put these on?
-I'm driving!

103
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.956
You do the driving. I do the navigating.

104
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.124
-What is that?
-I don't know.

105
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.459
Steve. slow down.

106
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.128
Is he ahead of us or not?

107
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.713
-Steve!
-Steve. watch out!

108
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:27.632
-Steve. watch out!
-Shit!

109
00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:36.557
<i>Jonathan.
it's Mom. Answer me. please. Over.</i>

110
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.976
<i>Jonathan. please answer.</i>

111
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:44.815
Jonathan. Nancy. Dustin. it's Joyce.
Please answer me.

112
00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.442
Hey.

113
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.693
Any luck?

114
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.698
Well. on the plus side.
I guess that means they made it through.

115
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.636
Do you wanna see where they're headed?

116
00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:26.315
What is it?

117
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.733
I don't know.

118
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:32.738
but I could feel it's important to him.

119
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.908
To Mr... Whatsit?

120
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.535
His real name is Henry.

121
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:38.578
AKA Vecna.

122
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:39.745
AKA One.

123
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.372
That's too many names.

124
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:44.166
Why won't you just zip it
and listen. dipshit?

125
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.128
I had this feeling
he didn't want me there.

126
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.631
I wasn't supposed to see it.

127
00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:54.010
You've never been this close
to the hive mind before.

128
00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.887
I mean. that thing was. like. feet away.

129
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.934
Sometimes at The Squawk.
when a signal comes in too strong.

130
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.853
it overloads the whole system.

131
00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:06.480
I think that's what this was. an overload.

132
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.983
You didn't just tap into the hive mind.

133
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:12.403
You jacked right in
to the goddamn control center.

134
00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.697
And Holly. Where was Holly?

135
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.658
Holly. Holly. she was...

136
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:21.120
She was attached to this... this spire.

137
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:26.667
And she became a part of it somehow.
like it was doing something to her.

138
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.834
And... And there were others.

139
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.590
There were three others.

140
00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:37.845
I thought
Vecna was just coming for dipshit.

141
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:41.294
So did I. But I only knew about Derek
because he walked right past me.

142
00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:45.061
Serendipitous timing.

143
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.939
-You hear that? Serendipitous.
-I don't know what that means.

144
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:51.233
I'm really not loving
all of these extra spires.

145
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.862
I mean. night one. Vecna kidnaps Holly.
Night two. he takes three more.

146
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:57.406
He's escalating. And he's coming for more.

147
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.743
Eight more. if this is accurate.
which brings him to a total of 12.

148
00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.996
What does he want with them? And why kids?

149
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.164
-And why 12?
-I don't know.

150
00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:07.250
But we have to stop him
before he takes any more

151
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.253
and buy Dustin and the others time
to find this place. to find Holly.

152
00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:14.048
If we can pinpoint his exact targets.
we could get them out of Hawkins.

153
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:15.383
And out of Vecna's reach.

154
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:16.759
Did you forget we're quarantined?

155
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.011
-That's not all.
-There's another problem.

156
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.722
On the way here.
we saw soldiers load Debbie Miller

157
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.683
onto a bus with a bunch more kids.

158
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.769
We followed them for two blocks more.
and they loaded more kids onto it.

159
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.897
I don't think
they were taking them to school.

160
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.224
Vecna's not the only one
that wants these kids.

161
00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:42.159
Eleven was at the Wheeler house
the same night Holly was taken.

162
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.454
Twenty-four hours later.
we've got three more missing kids.

163
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:49.583
There's 73 children in Hawkins
between the age of nine and ten.

164
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:53.379
If the pattern holds.
our next target will be from this group.

165
00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:57.216
And you believe
Eleven has taken these kids?

166
00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:58.467
For what purpose?

167
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:02.012
Killing them. protecting them.
The reason doesn't matter.

168
00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.765
These children? Where are they now?

169
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:07.226
Arriving at the MAC-Z any moment.
which is where I want you.

170
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.979
I should be looking for Lt. Akers.
I find Akers. I find...

171
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.106
You'll find a dead man.

172
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:14.942
Report to the MAC-Z. Colonel.
That's an order.

173
00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:23.242
Major General.

174
00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:28.247
With all due respect.
these kids are in danger.

175
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.541
To use them as bait seems...

176
00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:34.420
Seems what. Sergeant?

177
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.339
Reckless.

178
00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:43.471
It's only reckless
if you fail to protect them.

179
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:47.516
Are you telling me
you can't protect them. Sergeant?

180
00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:49.059
No. ma'am.

181
00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:52.563
Good.

182
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.995
I'm sorry for scaring you.

183
00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:13.417
I haven't seen anyone
in... a really long time. so...

184
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.545
I guess I got excited.

185
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.758
Good news is it doesn't look that deep.

186
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.301
Not enough for stitches.

187
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.221
I bet it stings though. huh?

188
00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.558
You can talk to me. you know.

189
00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:31.894
I won't bite.

190
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.565
You do remember me. right?

191
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.485
I've been to your house.

192
00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:40.778
Like. a lot.

193
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.617
You're Max. Max Mayfield.

194
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.036
You skateboard
and never take off your Walkman.

195
00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.205
-That's me.
-But...

196
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.922
How am I in here
when I'm in a coma in Hawkins General?

197
00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:58.087
That's a very reasonable question.

198
00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:02.388
We should get going.
It's not safe here. Come on.

199
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.052
Where are we going?

200
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:05.970
My home.

201
00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:08.222
Well. I can't go far.
I came here to meet Henry.

202
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:10.099
-Do you know Henry?
-You could say that.

203
00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:13.978
He left me this note. See? And he told me
to meet him right here at the X.

204
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.730
I think he's in trouble with the monsters.

205
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.524
Henry is a lot of things. but in trouble
with the monsters is not one of them.

206
00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:20.693
-But the note says...
-I know what the note says.

207
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.904
How do you know he's not in trouble?
He said hurry!

208
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:26.199
Holly. I know what the note says
because Henry didn't write it. I did.

209
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:30.870
I don't...
I don't understand.

210
00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:33.163
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:38.669
I didn't want to lie. I... I just...
I had to make sure that you came here.

212
00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:41.307
You're one of them. aren't you?

213
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.341
-One of what?
-The monsters.

214
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:46.302
-Do I look like a monster?
-I don't know. Maybe you're in disguise.

215
00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.512
You're dressed weird.
and you're in a coma.

216
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.763
Okay.

217
00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:53.767
Well. would a monster know
that your brother tried to get a mohawk

218
00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.477
until your sister stopped him.

219
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:58.522
saving him from possibly
the greatest social humiliation

220
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.143
that a freshman has ever experienced
at Hawkins High?

221
00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.861
What color was this mohawk?

222
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:05.446
Hot orange.

223
00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:09.575
And personally. I think the use
of the word "hot" is a bit ironic. but...

224
00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:11.243
People say I'm too negative.

225
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.745
I just think I'm honest.

226
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:36.852
Come on.

227
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.987
Welcome.

228
00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.173
Hey.

229
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.175
It even comes with a view.

230
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.491
Where are we?

231
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.785
In a memory.

232
00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:39.623
Which exists inside a world
of 1.000 memories.

233
00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:41.250
I know it might look nice.

234
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.293
but it's not.

235
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.755
This place. this world...

236
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.216
It's a prison.

237
00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.849
Henry's prison.

238
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.835
It's okay. sweetie.

239
00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:28.464
These are the good guys.
They're going to keep everyone safe.

240
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:32.384
Just try and think of this
as a field trip.

241
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.137
Mm-hmm. A learning expedition.

242
00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:53.030
Cargo has arrived.
I repeat. cargo has arrived.

243
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.619
They're taking them into a barracks
second from the library.

244
00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.669
Tunnels.

245
00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:17.596
Yeah. See? The north tunnel of the MAC-Z
runs right underneath the barracks.

246
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.890
-Lucky break.
-Bound to happen one of these days.

247
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.684
Gonna need more luck
if we want this plan to work.

248
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.603
If we're right. the military is trying
to protect these kids.

249
00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:26.480
So this barracks
is gonna be heavily guarded.

250
00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:28.982
We have to dig up
into the barracks. unnoticed.

251
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.277
grab the kids. get them to Murray.
smuggle them out of Hawkins.

252
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.487
All before anyone notices they're gone.

253
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.239
-Dick.
-What?

254
00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.366
What? Oh.

255
00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.995
Sorry. Did I say that out loud?
I thought I was talking in my head.

256
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.288
But you guys know
Tom. Dick. and Harry. right?

257
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:47.626
Seriously? None of you have seen
<i>The Great Escape?</i>

258
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:51.297
Basically. it's about these POWs. right?

259
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.299
And they're stuck
in a barracks just like this one.

260
00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.177
They need to escape.
so they dig these tunnels.

261
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.679
and they call their tunnels
Tom. Dick. and Harry.

262
00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:00.598
They have to hide the tunnels
from the Nazis.

263
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.934
So they put Tom in this dark corner.
and they put Harry under the stove.

264
00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:08.147
and they put Dick in the washroom.
And personally. for us. I like Dick.

265
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:15.863
Oh. um... Sorry. The washroom.
I actually don't even... Never mind.

266
00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:17.739
Okay. say we go with Dick.

267
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.117
How do we find the washroom?

268
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.744
And how do we get the kids to it?

269
00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.246
How do we know
which kids are being targeted by Vecna?

270
00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.833
We use an inside man.
someone who could get into the barracks.

271
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:31.087
measure the distance to the washroom.
find out which kids have seen Mr. Whatsit.

272
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.754
and somehow avoid the military.

273
00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:36.008
Well. that's a lovely plan.
but isn't it a tad...

274
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.217
<i>Mission Impossible-y.</i>

275
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:40.596
Yeah. I mean. Mike.
who are you gonna get to do this?

276
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.763
Bond? Magnum?

277
00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.807
No. no. we don't want a super spy.

278
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.720
We want the opposite.
We want someone no one would suspect.

279
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:49.605
Someone that could just walk in.
no questions asked.

280
00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:52.065
The one kid
the military failed to wrangle.

281
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.073
What?

282
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:34.441
Two grunts in the tower by the west gate.

283
00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:36.902
One more in the tower by the east gate.

284
00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:39.112
One. two. three. four on the ground.

285
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:42.574
I hope to God you're right.
and Vecna is in there.

286
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.826
because we might just die
trying to break in.

287
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.953
I am right.

288
00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:49.540
You can't be right about everything.
Your theories aren't exactly lining up.

289
00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.708
-Why not?
-You heard kryptonite.

290
00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.669
If Vecna's in there.
he doesn't have his powers.

291
00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:54.879
If he doesn't have his powers.

292
00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:57.131
how could he have anything to do
with Holly's kidnapping?

293
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.882
You can ask him before I kill him.

294
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.343
How high is that fence?

295
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.012
Hey. you're not jumping that.

296
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.389
Why not?

297
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:09.726
Because this is not training.
This is a real-world situation.

298
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.104
And that roof is metal.

299
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:15.482
You hit that on a jump.
you're gonna alert the whole damn base.

300
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:17.026
Not if I time it with the thunder.

301
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.694
Yeah.

302
00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:20.237
It's seven seconds.

303
00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:30.991
One. two. three. four. five. six...

304
00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:35.419
Seven.

305
00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:36.962
Okay. You got lucky.

306
00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.341
-<i>Hopper. do you copy?</i>
-Dustin!

307
00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:41.925
<i>Over. This is Dustin.</i>

308
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:44.511
<i>Hopper. do you copy? This is Dustin.</i>

309
00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:47.055
Hey. hey. it's Hop. I copy.

310
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.891
Holy shit! Okay. They're alive!

311
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.059
El! Ask about El.

312
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.353
El. Is El with you? Over.

313
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.271
Yes. I'm here. Over.

314
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:56.356
Okay. Yay. Terrific.

315
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.109
I don't know if you're caught up
in something important. but...

316
00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:00.194
-Dustin. Come on.
-Meet us!

317
00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.654
Meet us at Roane Cemetery church. please.

318
00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:05.741
Roane Cemetery. How the hell
are you contacting us from there?

319
00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.785
Right. You don't know.
We're in the Upside Down.

320
00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:09.828
What?

321
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:12.957
Long story short. we're here to track
a Demogorgon using our telemetry tracker.

322
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.960
only to then hit a wall. Literally.
Now. Steve's beamer is stuck.

323
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.128
so we need El to come and pry it loose
using her powers

324
00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:20.005
so we can resume the search
for said Demogorgon

325
00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:23.259
which will. in theory. lead us to Holly.
Does any of this make sense?

326
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:26.762
Do you need additional details?
Questions? Concerns? Over.

327
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.013
You hit a wall?

328
00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.766
What kind of wall. exactly?

329
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.271
Uh... it's a bit... hard to describe.

330
00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:38.982
-Sort of...
-Huge?

331
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.402
Disgusting.

332
00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.570
Smells like Henderson's armpit.

333
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.615
We hit the same thing.
but not at the Roane Cemetery.

334
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.527
We hit it a quarter mile southeast
of the old Hagen Bridge.

335
00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:52.162
That's the opposite side of town.

336
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.498
Fascinating.

337
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.792
We don't know what it is.
but we think Holly's behind it.

338
00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.586
Don't bother trying to break through.
You can't.

339
00:23:00.128 --> 00:23:01.494
We're working on a solution.

340
00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:04.925
-Nancy.
-Solution? What kind of solution?

341
00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:08.678
<i>Wait. what kind of solution? Hopper!</i>

342
00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:11.473
Listen. we gotta keep the airwaves clear.
all right?

343
00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.850
We'll come get you. Just stay put.

344
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.146
You think they're safe?

345
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.939
I mean. compared to us? Yeah.

346
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.941
Okay.

347
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.028
Let's go see
if that training has paid off.

348
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.904
You're gonna let me jump?

349
00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.324
Let's go before I change my mind.

350
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.041
<i>Vecna's curse.</i>

351
00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:40.752
<i>it never goes away.</i>

352
00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:42.629
<i>Never leaves you.</i>

353
00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:46.383
With each victim that he took.
he created a new gate.

354
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:48.510
A gate to the Upside Down?

355
00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:53.557
When he took me.
he opened the fourth. final gate.

356
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.860
splitting Hawkins in two.

357
00:23:56.893 --> 00:24:03.608
Wait. but if Mr. Whatsit...
I mean Henry. took you. how are you here?

358
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.193
You mean. shouldn't I be dead?

359
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.864
It's okay. It's a fair question.

360
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:10.866
I definitely should be.

361
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:13.535
And for a moment...

362
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:15.912
I was.

363
00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:21.085
<i>I don't know how long I was gone.</i>

364
00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:25.589
<i>But then I felt
something... calling to me.</i>

365
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:19.309
<i>♪ Life could be dream ♪</i>

366
00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:22.270

367
00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.690

368
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:28.193

Tickets are only 50 cents.

369
00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:30.487
That's two quarters for you poindexters.

370
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:35.158
-Joyce! This that stupid play of yours?
-I better see you there. Harrington.

371
00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:37.410
Friday night? You wish.

372
00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.330
<i>♪ Life could be dream ♪</i>

373
00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:41.915

<i>♪ If only all my precious plans

375
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:48.713
<i>Somehow. I was in another time.</i>

00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:50.131
<i>Hawkins.</i>

377
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:52.968
<i>Thirty years ago.</i>

378
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.177
Time travel.

379
00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:57.931
Only. I wasn't actually there.

380
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.350
Not really. I was just...

381
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:02.686
an observer.

382
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.024
<i>And that's when I understood.</i>

383
00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:12.028
I was trapped inside Henry's mind.
his memories.

384
00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:15.073
Like a nightmare prison world

385
00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:19.119
ruled by an evil.
psychopathic piece of shit.

386
00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:21.162
Like Camazotz.

387
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.206
Cama... What?

388
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.542
Camazotz. From <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i>

389
00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:27.544
-Never read it.
-You should. It's amazing.

390
00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:30.589
Camazotz is like this dark planet
that's under the control of IT.

391
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.841
which is this giant.
disembodied. evil brain.

392
00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:34.927
Anyways. Meg's dad...
Meg's the main character.

393
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.470
...he gets taken prisoner there.

394
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:39.723
So. Henry's kinda like IT.
and you're kinda like Meg's dad.

395
00:26:39.806 --> 00:26:40.974
Okay. Well...

396
00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:44.853
I don't know if Meg's dad would agree.
but the way I see it.

397
00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:48.732
when you're a prisoner
in a messed up prison world.

398
00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:50.961
you really only have
a few doors open to you.

399
00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.738
Door one. you take your own life.

400
00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:58.700
Door two. accept your fate.

401
00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:01.161
-Or door three...
-You escape.

402
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:04.414
-I chose door three.
-That seems like the best door.

403
00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:07.584
So. I kept moving.

404
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:10.629
From memory to memory.

405
00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:13.840
Only. this place is a maze.

406
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:19.012
I became lost. turned around.
I got so turned around.

407
00:27:19.095 --> 00:27:21.931
I actually ended up
right back at the beginning.

408
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.735
<i>And that's when I heard her.</i>

409
00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.988
["Running up that Hill"

410
00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.573
I heard Kate Bush.

411
00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.533
Is she one of your friends?

412
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.453
You could say that.

413
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:46.665

415
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:55.882
Lucas had used it before. to reach me.
to guide me out of Vecna's mind.

416
00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:57.425
back to the light.

417
00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:02.806

<i>♪ Be runnin' up that road ♪</i>

420
00:28:08.144 --> 00:28:13.316
So. this music was coming from Lucas.
from the real world?

421
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:19.948
Even after all this time.

422
00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.826
he hadn't given up on me.

423
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.662
If you follow this music.

424
00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:27.580
then what?

425
00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:30.625
Then it would lead me out of here.

426
00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:33.586
Back home.

427
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.757
At least. that's what I thought.

428
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.553
But then...

429
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.308
everything went wrong.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.844
Right. I see that. officer.

435
00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:25.513
It's just... my school is missing.

436
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.408
Let's go.

437
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.574
Move it.

438
00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:52.707
Holy shit! Are those laser blasters?

439
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.083
Might just be.

440
00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:56.628
And they'll blast you
if you don't keep it moving.

441
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:02.884
-Boys.
-Can't get me!

442
00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:03.968

443
00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.348
All right. Absolutely not.

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

445
00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:14.521
This is Private Chapman.
You do exactly as he says.

446
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:17.273
You got any questions. direct them to him.

447
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:20.235
Where might I relieve myself?

448
00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:24.197
Breaking bar.

449
00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.115
Shovel.

450
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.369

456
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.597
Foam padding?

457
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.934
Don't want to break any eggs en route.
now do we?

You're...

464
00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:13.079
Delightful Derek.

465
00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:28.928
Okay. once you get
that gate open. and I'm inside...

466
00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.972
-You lead.
-That's right.

467
00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.056

477
00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:25.962

478
00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:28.589
Thank you.

479
00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:30.049
For what?

480
00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:31.759
For teaching me.

481
00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.887
And trusting me.

482
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.348
Always.

483
00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:46.441
<i>The day of reckoning has arrived.</i>

484
00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.818
With this in mind.
I've been sent by Mr. Whatsit

485
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:50.153
to gather the chosen ones.

486
00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:52.822
If you've been visited by Mr. Whatsit.
speak now.

487
00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:55.408
And when night falls.
follow me to the latrine.

488
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.703
and I will lead you
to our savior. to safety.

489
00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.706
Derek's gone mental.

490
00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:06.294
The monsters are coming.
and you're all gonna die.

491
00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:09.255
Derek?

492
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.175
Were you talking about Henry?

493
00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:25.354
Any word from Derek yet?

494
00:34:25.438 --> 00:34:26.773
Not yet.

495
00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:29.400
Just give him time.
It hasn't been that long.

496
00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:31.736
I just can't get over the fact

497
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:36.282
that the fate of the world rests
on Derek freakin' Turnbow.

498
00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:39.536
When you look in the mirror. do you see
a Navy SEAL looking back at you?

499
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:42.622
Sometimes people need
someone to believe in them.

500
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.209
And then they can do amazing things.

501
00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:49.087
Your mom and Robin
are getting along better.

502
00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:52.924
Well. it didn't hurt
that Mom scared off that Demo.

503
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:55.885
Saved Robin's life. everybody's life.

504
00:34:59.013 --> 00:35:02.642
So. when your mom. when she had her axe.

505
00:35:02.725 --> 00:35:04.018
you could see her?

506
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:06.020
-Like. through the Demo's eyes?
-Yeah.

507
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.481
And I was so close to the hive.

508
00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:13.111
it's like I could feel
what it was feeling. like this anger.

509
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:15.571
That I was still in there too.

510
00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:17.949
And I was afraid. I was afraid for my mom.

511
00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:21.661
-You wanted to protect her.
-Yeah. But I... I just couldn't.

512
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:25.039
It was like this scary movie
you just can't turn off.

513
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.795
Open sesame.

514
00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:35.258
Oh. Well. have fun.

515
00:35:36.008 --> 00:35:37.051
Thanks.

516
00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:40.388
-Are you positive you didn't?
-Didn't what?

517
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.556
Turn off the scary movie.

518
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.308
Protect your mom.
not the other way around.

519
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:46.061
No offense. I know she's badass
and everything. but you know.

520
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.687
-Yeah. she's 5'3".
-Yeah!

521
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.940
And Vecna likes to control the hive mind
like a puppet master.

522
00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:53.985
So maybe when you tap into the hive.
you can pull the strings too.

523
00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:56.154
Except I'm not Vecna.

524
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.238
You sorta are.

525
00:35:57.947 --> 00:36:01.034
You're trying to say that I'm evil
and hell-bent on destroying the world?

526
00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:02.076
Totally.

527
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.580
No. I'm just saying that. you know.
you're like a wizard like him.

528
00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:07.623
In D&D. Mike. not real life.

529
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:10.084
True. In real life.
you're more like a sorcerer.

530
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.004
because your powers don't come
from a book of spells. They're innate.

531
00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:17.175
Listen. as far as crazy theories go.
I've had crazier.

532
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:20.624
And with Eleven in the Upside Down.
we really need some magic up here.

533
00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:00.551
Working on a solution?

534
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:04.722
I mean. if Hopper has a solution
to get through this and to get to Holly.

535
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:06.432
he should... he should share it with us!

536
00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:08.142
I just say we ignore the old man.

537
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.853
We keep moving.
Look for a door or something.

538
00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:13.481
Yeah. and just curious.

539
00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:16.359
This door of yours.
it's soft like a Peanut Butter Bopper?

540
00:37:16.442 --> 00:37:18.528
You got something to say. Byers.
why don't you say it?

541
00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:21.239
I'm just saying maybe you shouldn't be
making the calls from now on.

542
00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:24.992
It was not just his call.
It was mine because it's my sister.

543
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:26.953
And...

544
00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:30.373
I agree with Steve.
Okay. we can't just sit here.

545
00:37:30.456 --> 00:37:34.377
I don't know about a door.
but this wall can't go on forever.

546
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.254
There has to be a way around it.

547
00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:37.380
There isn't.

548
00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:40.508
This wall is a circle.

549
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:43.177
A circle completely surrounding
the Upside Down.

550
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.679
Oh yeah? How do you figure that?

551
00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:47.431
Because unlike you.
I didn't sleep through Algebra 1.

552
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.854
My telemetry tracker picked up
a weird frequency coming from the wall.

553
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:57.233
and it took me a bit to place.
but I've heard it before.

554
00:37:57.316 --> 00:37:59.861
Rather. we have.
Remember when we were out looking for Hop.

555
00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.613
and you heard that sound
off of Irwin Road?

556
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:04.156
-Yeah. You said it was interference.
-It was.

557
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.952
But this interference. it wasn't coming
from a military broadcast or an EMI.

558
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:10.788
It was coming from this wall.
which is important.

559
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:13.374
because that gives us
three known locations.

560
00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.959
So. I connected the dots.

561
00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:17.670
measured the midpoints.
drew the perpendicular bisectors...

562
00:38:17.753 --> 00:38:21.090
All right! Yeah. we're not your teachers.
We don't need to see your work.

563
00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:23.259
We get it.
You think it's all a big circle.

564
00:38:23.342 --> 00:38:26.638
I don't think. I know. I triple checked.
and my calculations are correct.

565
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.849
Whatever! I still don't see
how this gets us closer to finding Holly.

566
00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:33.144
Because it's not about the circle.
It's about the center.

567
00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:37.773
The DOE. The Department of Energy.

568
00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:40.359
-That's...
-Hawkins Lab.

569
00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.196
What are the chances
that the center of this wall

570
00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:45.657
happens to be in the place
where all of this started.

571
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.658
where the Upside Down was created?

572
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:49.327
So. the lab created the wall?

573
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.663
No idea. But I think we should find out.

574
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.248
Don't you?

575
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.716
<i>The music.
it led me to a new memory.</i>

576
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.011
<i>Only. something was different
about this memory.</i>

577
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.852
<i>I was there.</i>

578
00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:12.767
<i>It was the day that Henry cursed me.</i>

579
00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.227
It was his first memory of me.

580
00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:19.940
I know. as if this goddamn place
wasn't heady enough. right?

581
00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:23.319
But I still had the music to guide me.

582
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.696
So I followed it.

583
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:30.826
And it led me through new memories.

584
00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.710
Terrible memories.

585
00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:42.088
-Let go!
-Follow me into death.

586
00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:59.105
And it felt like they would never end.

587
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.778
But then eventually. they did.

588
00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.032
<i>It was the night that Vecna killed me.</i>

589
00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:12.744
["Running up that Hill"

590
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:14.583
<i>The night he took me prisoner.</i>

591
00:40:15.704 --> 00:40:17.456
<i>♪ Yeah. yeah. yo ♪</i>

592
00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.167

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.836

594
00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:25.714
<i>♪ Do you wanna hear

595
00:40:27.007 --> 00:40:28.551

<i>♪ It's you and me ♪</i>

597

599
00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:49.321

00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:55.619
<i>So close
that I could feel his hand on mine.</i>

601
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.207
<i>And it was like I was there.</i>

602
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.086

No.

607
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.831
Lucas!

608
00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:45.878
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

609
00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:50.508
Hello. Max.

610
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.763
I ran.

611
00:41:58.641 --> 00:41:59.850
And I kept running.

612
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.635
<i>I'll never forget
the look on his face that day.</i>

613
00:42:36.512 --> 00:42:38.472
<i>He was scared.</i>

614
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:42.184
<i>More than scared. he was terrified.</i>

615
00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:44.603
There's something about this cave...

616
00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.064
this memory.

617
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:50.901
He won't come in.

618
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:53.696
In here.

619
00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:55.823
I'm safe.

620
00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.868
So I turned it into my sanctuary.

621
00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:04.540
My home.

622
00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.627
I took door two.

623
00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:11.755
Shitty door two.

624
00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:15.593
Accept your fate.

625
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:17.678
That was.

626
00:43:18.804 --> 00:43:20.222
until you showed up.

627
00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:23.267
And now door three is back.

628
00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:25.853
Escape.

629
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.231
I have a plan.
a plan to get us out of here.

630
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.277
And it's gonna take time.
more time than we have now.

631
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.487
Henry will return to his house soon.

632
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.407
And when he does.
he cannot know that you're gone.

633
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.284
You want me to go back there?

634
00:43:41.243 --> 00:43:42.828
Back to him? Back to Henry? No. I...

635
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:44.872
I know. It's scary.

636
00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:50.085
But if you wanna get out of here.
if you wanna escape Camazotz.

637
00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:52.087
this is the only way.

638
00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.049
It's the only way.

639
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:02.097
Tell me what I need to do.

640
00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:21.909
Hey. wh...

641
00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.243
-Hey.
-Hi.

642
00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:30.042
Do you. um. by any chance.
remember Tammy Thompson?

643
00:44:30.125 --> 00:44:32.836
Yeah. Isn't she that terrible singer?

644
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.588
Yeah.

645
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.090
But in the ninth grade.

646
00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:39.802
I thought that she sounded
like Whitney goddamn Houston.

647
00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:45.391
I mean. the first time I saw her.
oh my God. like. time slowed down.

648
00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:47.976
It was like a scene
from some lame-o movie.

649
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:52.064
You know. her hair blew in the wind.
and she just looked perfect.

650
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.274
So goddamn perfect.

651
00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:57.861
And. uh. it was right then and there
that I knew she was the one.

652
00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:02.908
That with Tammy. I would finally be able
to be myself. you know. all of myself.

653
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:08.414
Because there was always this part of me
that kind of scared me. you know?

654
00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:12.418
But I thought
that if Tammy loved me. all of me.

655
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:15.879
you know. I wouldn't be so scared anymore.

656
00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:19.383
And then he showed up.
Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

657
00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:20.926
Oh God.

658
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:22.678
You probably can guess the rest.

659
00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:25.472
Tammy fell for him hard.

660
00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:31.437
And my entire fantasy life with her.
along with the rest of my life.

661
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.272
pretty much imploded before my eyes.

662
00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:35.524
I mean. my grades plummeted.
I got grounded.

663
00:45:35.607 --> 00:45:37.693
I had to stay home every weekend
doing chores.

664
00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:41.030
But then one day. I was cleaning bat shit
out of my parents' garage.

665
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:43.574
and I found this 8-millimeter film reel.
You know?

666
00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:46.952
And it was just from this silly movie
that I made in fourth grade.

667
00:45:47.035 --> 00:45:48.871
but I got it up on the projector.

668
00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:53.792
and all of a sudden. I was looking
at this little version of myself.

669
00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:57.254
And that little me.
I could hardly recognize her.

670
00:45:57.337 --> 00:46:00.591
You know. she was so carefree

671
00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:04.011
and. like. fearless.

672
00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:06.555
She just loved every part of herself.

673
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.158
And that's when it hit me.

674
00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:12.352
It was never about Tone-deaf Tammy.

675
00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.815
It was always just about me.

676
00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:19.914
I was looking for answers
in somebody else. but...

677
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.822
I had all the answers.

678
00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:27.534
I just needed to stop being
so goddamn scared.

679
00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:31.914
Scared of... who I really was.

680
00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:34.958
Once I did that. oh.

681
00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.795
I felt so free.

682
00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:42.090
It's like I could fly. you know?
Like. I could finally be...

683
00:46:42.174 --> 00:46:43.550
Rockin' Robin.

684
00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:47.137
Yeah. Rockin' Robin.

685
00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:49.890
Hey. guys!

686
00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.433
Take your time. will ya?

687
00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.023
Did you finally hit Dick?

688
00:46:58.106 --> 00:46:59.608
-Hit the Dick.
-Yep.

689
00:46:59.691 --> 00:47:01.693
Let's just hope it's not too hard.

690
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:02.861
If it is.

691
00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:04.947
I'll soften it.

692
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.537
Hey!

693
00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:13.831
Hey!

694
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:16.458
Hey!

695
00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:19.920
Take me to Kay.

696
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.859
Damn it! Damn it!

697
00:47:46.405 --> 00:47:49.658
Make a sound. it'll be your last.
Nod if you understand.

698
00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:55.247
Move! Move it! Come on. let's go!

699
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:57.082
Come on!

700
00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:00.252
It's not working.

701
00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:03.339
-How do we get through?
-I don't have clearance.

702
00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:06.592
I didn't ask if you have clearance.
I asked. how do we get through?

703
00:48:06.675 --> 00:48:07.801
You can't.

704
00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:11.388
Dr. Kay. your boss. she got clearance?

705
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:12.514
I don't know.

706
00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:14.349
You don't know.

707
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.935
Thanks for your help.

708
00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:18.604
Plan B.

709
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:45.130
-Stop! Stop!
-El!

710
00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:48.133
-El!
-Stop!

711
00:49:26.254 --> 00:49:27.547
We're through.

712
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:37.599
Oh. shit.

713
00:49:58.412 --> 00:49:59.371
Oh. shit.

714
00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:09.589
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

715
00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.925
Breathe in and out.

716
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.011
As you continue breathing.

717
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:16.888
I want you to picture yourself on a beach.

718
00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:20.434
The water is blue. Blue as a Smurf.

719
00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:26.064
You listen to it lap the sandy shore.
like a dog slurping from his bowl.

720
00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:35.198
It's called visualization.

721
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:37.200
Mom does it when she's out of Valium.

722
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:50.797
Go.

723
00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.177
Howdy.

724
00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:47.646
Feel the sand under your butt.
It feels cool and soft.

725
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:49.898
...time. There you go.

726
00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.901
Good job. good job. All right.

727
00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:56.696
Hey. sweetie. Um. what's your name?

728
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.198
Debbie.

729
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:00.033
Do you work for Mr. Whatsit?

730
00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:01.243
Mr. Whatsit.

731
00:52:01.326 --> 00:52:04.704
Oh. Um. yes. Of course.
I'm one of his elves.

732
00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:07.582
You know. like a... a magic elf.

733
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:27.394
Right here. A couple more steps.

734
00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:29.563
All right. Yes. okay.

735
00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:32.774
All right. Great job. Step by step.

736
00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:49.958
Shit.

737
00:53:27.078 --> 00:53:27.913
Eleven.

738
00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:33.293
I have been looking for you
for a very long time.

739
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.171
My name is...

740
00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:37.339
Dr. Kay.

741
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.259
I know who you are.

742
00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:45.347
I know who you've taken.

743
00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:51.102
And I also know...

744
00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:55.232
that you and your men...

745
00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.110
are going to die.

746
00:54:29.307 --> 00:54:30.600
What the hell?

747
00:55:35.582 --> 00:55:37.667
It's best not to struggle.

748
00:55:38.877 --> 00:55:43.340
The greater the perceived threat.
the more aggressive its response.

749
00:55:49.262 --> 00:55:51.139
Miss Robin. what about the others?

750
00:55:51.222 --> 00:55:53.600
Uh. just Robin. And don't worry.
They're right behind us.

751
00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.936
-Something's wrong. isn't it?
-No. No. siree.

752
00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:58.214
Everything is going
exactly according to plan.

753
00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:01.691
-Airlock... Wrap it with your jacket.
-I got it.

754
00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:03.735
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

755
00:56:03.818 --> 00:56:05.362
Here. Try it...

756
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.283
Hey. Sorry.
Bit of a plumbing problem here.

757
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:12.416
Are you by chance looking for Mr. Whatsit?

758
00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.330
-Right through there.
-Right there.

759
00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.413
There's a little breeze
in the air telling you a secret.

760
00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:32.597
You look up at the sky.
searching for clouds. but all you...

761
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.408
Mr. Whatsit?

762
00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.205
Shit!

763
00:56:57.288 --> 00:56:58.581
Officer! Officer!

764
00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:00.208
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Hey. calm down.

765
00:57:00.291 --> 00:57:01.418
-What's going on?
-Shitballs.

766
00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:02.335
Good job. man.

767
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:04.963
-Lucas! We've been spotted!
-No. no!

768
00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:06.256
Get 'em out of here. Go.

769
00:57:06.339 --> 00:57:08.383
-What about the others?
-Just go! Go. go. go!

770
00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:09.881
Damn it! Okay. come on. guys.

771
00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:18.435
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

772
00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:19.894
Hey. stop right there!

773
00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:22.021
Ashley Klein is a snitch!

774
00:57:24.023 --> 00:57:24.941
Hey!

775
00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.574
Open the door! Open the goddamn door!

776
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:41.458
So you're the reason.

777
00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:45.670
The reason she's been so hard to track.

778
00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:49.883
The thorn in my side.

779
00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:58.176
And after all that effort to hide her.
you bring her here. of all places?

780
00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:00.727
Why?

781
00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:04.898
Why risk her life for the other?

782
00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:08.902
What do you know that I don't?

783
00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:19.120
It's actually holding back.
if you can believe it.

784
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:21.664
That heat you feel...

785
00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:24.584
weakens it.

786
00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:32.509
But in the cold. it thrives.

787
00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:38.640
I can stop it.

788
00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:41.142
But you're gonna have to start talking.

789
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:01.079
Go to hell.

790
00:59:15.802 --> 00:59:18.888
In your current state.
I'm afraid that won't work.

791
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:31.317
Not the sharpest. are we?

792
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.965
You're too late. Cavalry's on its way.

793
00:59:54.048 --> 00:59:55.466
That's all right.

794
00:59:56.634 --> 00:59:57.719
I'll be quick.

795
01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:11.524
Grocery delivery.

796
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.026
Where's everyone else?

797
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.277
Coming.

798
01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:20.908
Come on. sweetie. Come on down. Come on.

799
01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:24.120
You get down here right now.
or a monster's gonna eat you.

800
01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.498
Open the door!

801
01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.875
You little shit!

802
01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.251
Get out of the way!

803
01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:31.961
About goddamn time!

804
01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.390
I got you.
That's good. Good. good.

805
01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.851
Hey there.
Where do you think you're going?

806
01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:01.658
What are you doing?

807
01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.995
Hey. you gotta go. You gotta go. Come on.

808
01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:11.459
We're gonna get to the woods.

809
01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:14.003
The kryptonite shit can't get you there.

810
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.673
Hop. we can't. We can't leave.
We came for Henry.

811
01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.967
Hey. You take this compass.
You're gonna follow it northeast.

812
01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:23.346
That'll take you to the graveyard.
You're gonna find Nancy and the others.

813
01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:25.473
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Hey. hey. hey. Hey.

814
01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:26.474
What is that?

815
01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.434
It's just a failsafe. okay?

816
01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.019
-It's a failsafe.
-No.

817
01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.813
I gotta make sure he goes down with me.

818
01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:34.524
-No. No. Hop.
-It's the only way. It's the only way.

819
01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.693
I'm not gonna risk losing you.

820
01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:37.902
I will not risk it.

821
01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.780
-Hopper. No.
-Listen. I want you to know something.

822
01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.365
From here on out.

823
01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:44.992
I want you to know how proud I am of you.

824
01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:48.371
I am so proud of you.
I am so proud of what you've overcome.

825
01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.041
I'm proud of who you are.

826
01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.918
No.

827
01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:57.714
No. No. Hop. Hopper!

828
01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.467
-I love you. Jane.
-Hopper! No! Hopper!

829
01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:09.642
Hop!

830
01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:11.978
Hopper!

831
01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.398
Hopper!

832
01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:16.941
Hop!

833
01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:19.068
Hopper!

834
01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.242
Hopper!

835
01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:29.162
Hopper! Hopper!

836
01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:31.706
Hopper!

837
01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.296
Pulse ox is falling.

838
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.924
Flatlining!

839
01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.033
All right. kids. Come on.
Find a seat in the back.

840
01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:12.246
Hi.

841
01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:14.582
All right.

842
01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:17.835
Okay. let's have some fun. huh?
This is gonna be great. huh?

843
01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.796
Okay. Let's get our seat belts on. hmm?

844
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.673
Safety first. Come on. Time's a-wastin'.

845
01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:23.633
Pretty comfy. huh?

846
01:03:23.716 --> 01:03:25.092
Not really.

847
01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.886
Oh. sorry.

848
01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.889
<i>Robin. Lucas. do you copy? Over.</i>

849
01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:30.890
Copy. It's Robin.

850
01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:32.058
Lucas. I copy.

851
01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.145
We've got a problem here at the MAC.

852
01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.395
What kind of problem?

853
01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.564
Let go of me. you asshole!

854
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.694
You want to explain to me
what in God's name is going on here?

855
01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:43.945
Get the hell off me.

856
01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:46.781
-We've got five missing kids. sir.
-You've lost five kids?

857
01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:48.199
-How is that possible?
-This woman...

858
01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:49.367
Joyce Byers.

859
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.744
She broke into the barracks.

860
01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.496
She's been helping them escape
through some kind of tunnel.

861
01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:55.414
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

862
01:03:55.498 --> 01:04:00.086
Listen. These kids. they are not safe.

870
01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:25.653
Is that all the military does? Hit kids?

Stay away from him! You stay away!

921
01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:13.717
Can you see them...

922
01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.094
William?

923
01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.099
Can you see the children?

924
01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.519
<i>Do you know why?</i>

925
01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:30.776
<i>Why I chose them to reshape the world?</i>

926
01:15:35.405 --> 01:15:38.408
<i>It's because they are weak.</i>

927
01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:47.459
Weak in body and mind.

928
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.091
Please!

929
01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.593
<i>Easily broken.</i>

930
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.138
<i>Easily reshaped.</i>

931
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.016
<i>Controlled.</i>

932
01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:08.313
<i>The perfect vessels.</i>

933
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.900
<i>And you...</i>

934
01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:13.986
Will.

935
01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.947
You were the first.

936
01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:24.871
And you broke so easily.

937
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:35.757
You showed me what was possible.

938
01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:38.135
what I could achieve.

939
01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:43.140
Some minds. it turns out.

940
01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:47.060
simply do not belong in this world.

941
01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:57.029
They belong in mine.

942
01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:49.164
<i>I was looking for the answers
in somebody else. but</i>...

943
01:17:49.247 --> 01:17:51.667
<i>I had all the answers.</i>

944
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.306
Do you wanna be friends?

945
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.104
<i>I just...</i>

946
01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:16.983
<i>needed to stop being so goddamn scared.</i>

947
01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:26.993
<i>Scared of who I really was.</i>

948
01:18:31.289 --> 01:18:33.583
Wow! It's so good!

949
01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:00.652
<i>And once I did that.</i>

950
01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:02.654
<i>I was so free.</i>

951
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.407
<i>It's like I could fly.</i>
