00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:29.066
Should I stay or should I go now?

3
00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:34.113
Should I stay or should I go now?

4
00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:38.576
If I go. there will be trouble

5
00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.079
And if I stay. it will be double

6
00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:49.170
So. come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

7
00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:51.518
At long last.

8
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.188
we can begin.

9
00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:23.842
You and I.

10
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.558
we are going to do
such beautiful things together. William.

11
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.609
Such beautiful things.

12
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.042
Holly.

13
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.211
Holly!

14
00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:20.839
Holly!

15
00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:22.508
I've been calling you.

16
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.675
I'm sorry.

17
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.260
Could you round up the troops?

18
00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:29.973
Breakfast!

19
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.517
Coming!

20
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:33.394
Nance. come on.

21
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.231
Let me in.
or I'm gonna whiz on the floor right here.

22
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:39.733
Sorry. Mrs. Byers.

23
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:41.110
Whiz away.

24
00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:42.945
Wow.

25
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.031
Shit.

26
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:48.909
Breakfast!

27
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.413
Shit. dude. we overslept.

28
00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:55.082
-I thought you were setting an alarm.
-I thought you were.

29
00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.675
-It's not always Jonathan's fault.
-It's always Jonathan's…

30
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.844
It wasn't my fault. I told you…

31
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.763
Holly. can you pass the bacon?

32
00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:12.349
Holly! Bacon!

33
00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.938
-You need to just drop it.
-Whatever you want.

34
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.232
You don't need it. You're crazy. huh?

35
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.778
Karen. do you have any Midol upstairs?

36
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.034
Nancy. dishes in the sink.

37
00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:34.413
Be back at 5:00 or 6:00. Let me know
if you need me to pick up anything.

38
00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.873
-Boogie!
-Come on. Hurry up.

39
00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.791
-I'm coming.
-Holly. your jacket.

40
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.460
-Here. Don't forget it.
-Thank you.

41
00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:40.419
Hug.

42
00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:41.336
-Bye.
-Bye.

43
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.089
I'm sorry. I can't help clean up.
I'm running late.

44
00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:46.800
It's okay. Joyce. really. I understand.

45
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:49.219
How much longer?

46
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:53.724
What do you want me to do. Ted. huh?
Kick 'em to the street?

47
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.893
Is that an option?

48
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.567
Hey. wait up! Wait up!

49
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.110
Come on. we gotta go!

50
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.992
The Morning Squawk. Mike.
we're gonna miss it!

51
00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.913
Good morning. Hawkins!
This is WSQK The Squawk!

52
00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:17.581
That's a new one.

53
00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.750
It's looking like a regular day
in Hawkins.

54
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.002
Fifty-five degrees. low chance of rain.

55
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.714
medium chance of arrest.
high chance of helicopters.

56
00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:29.593
But general banality aside.
it's an exciting day for me.

57
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.262
your friend. entertainer. and DJ.
Robin Buckley…

58
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:35.224
Nice to meet you! …AKA Rockin' Robin.

59
00:08:35.307 --> 00:08:37.559
And why is it a big day for me. you ask?

60
00:08:37.643 --> 00:08:40.229
Well. it's my 500th broadcast.

61
00:08:40.312 --> 00:08:43.649
Yeah. you heard that right. folks.
Five-double-O!

62
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.234
Which means it's been even longer

63
00:08:45.317 --> 00:08:48.153
since you've heard the sultry voice
of Jimmy "Fast Hands" Lee.

64
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:53.075
But while Jimmy was fleeing Hawkins
even faster than he moves those hands.

65
00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:57.246
yours truly was watching slack-jawed
as the earth split open beneath her feet

66
00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:00.457
and coughed up that tsunami
of mysterious dandruff.

67
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:04.503
And now. I'm stuck here with you.
my fellow quarantine compatriots.

68
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:08.507
And if I can be brutally honest.
I couldn't be happier.

69
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:13.595
Because when you really think about it.
why would you want to live anywhere else?

70
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.265
I mean. what town on Earth can match

71
00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:20.060
our very impressive
military-to-civilian ratio?

72
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:24.314
And those free.
mandatory medical checkups?

73
00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:25.816
I mean. very cool.

74
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.193
'Cause after we inhaled
those springtime snowflakes.

75
00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:29.528
who knows what's wrong with us?

76
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.239
Maybe we're fine. maybe not.

77
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.740
No one knows for sure.

78
00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:39.037
After all. this was a "natural phenomenon
never before seen by man."

79
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:45.127
A phenomenon now covered up
by a giant metal Band-Aid.

80
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.714
Quite the eyesore.
but hey. great for sledding.

81
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:53.093
Though seriously. kids. stop sledding
on the giant steel Band-Aid.

82
00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.637
You are going to kill yourselves.
Also. the men with guns.

83
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:58.974
-Go. go. go. go. go!
-They don't like it. not one bit.

84
00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:02.894
While we're on the subject
of things not to do.

85
00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:06.315
please steer clear
of the Military Access Control Zone.

86
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:10.569
aka the MAC-Z.
or as I like to call it. the Big Mac.

87
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.363
I have no idea what's going on in there.

88
00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.490
but I have a gut feeling

89
00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:19.661
there's a pretty good reason
they'd like you to stay away.

90
00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:23.040
But hey. the rest of Hawkins
is still there for you to enjoy.

91
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.542
Someday soon.
they're gonna let us out of here.

92
00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:27.461
In the meantime.
be thankful this is your home.

93
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:31.048
study for that test.
enjoy that TV dinner. and go on that date.

94
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.427
Which. by the way. is exactly
what yours truly is doing tonight.

95
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.014
That's right. Rockin' Robin has a date.
ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:44.269
And now. who is this lucky someone?

97
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:46.647
Well. don't be so nosy. kids.

98
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:49.066
They know who they are.

99
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:53.320
That is. if you're listening.
which I hope you are.

100
00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:56.907
Because this next one. it's for you. babe.

101
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.166
What the hell?

102
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:12.923
Whoa. What's going on?
What the hell? What the hell?

103
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.052
I told you to stop thumbing your nose
at the military.

104
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:20.389
I was reiterating their goddamn rules.
encouraging compliance.

105
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.141
-Right. No sarcasm there.
-Said the dingus with the rubber chicken.

106
00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:27.312
-These are very serious people. Robin.
-Shit. shit. shit. shit. shit!

107
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.067
Henderson. you copy? Henderson?

108
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.527
Yeah. I copy.

109
00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:37.030
God. you sound swell.
Let me take a wild guess.

110
00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:38.907
You're not calling
to wish me good morning.

111
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.327
It's not exactly a good morning.
We've got a situation at the Squawk.

112
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:44.496
The signal. it's… it's gone all wonky.

113
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.373
I think Robin finally pissed 'em off.

114
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.625
Doubtful. She was encouraging compliance.

115
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:49.710
Told you!

116
00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:51.920
The remote radio head's
the more likely culprit.

117
00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.089
-The remote what?
-Just read the manual. Steve.

118
00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.841
That thing might as well be in Greek.

119
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:56.800
Then learn Greek!

120
00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.678
I can't always be there
to solve your problems for you. Steve.

121
00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:01.471
Henderson?

122
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.099
God!

123
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.643
"Learn Greek." You heard that tone.

124
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.104
You heard that. right?

125
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.823
Watch it.

126
00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.833
What'd I tell you about that shirt. freak?

127
00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:33.587
Andy asked you a question. freak.
You deaf or what?

128
00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:38.633
For his sake. I hope he is.
because I thought I was pretty damn clear

129
00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.677
when I said
I didn't wanna see you in that shirt.

130
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.387
You also told me
to stop screwing your mom.

131
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:43.930
and that didn't stop me. did it?

132
00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:48.477
-Something funny. Henderson?
-Let go.

133
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.812
Hellfire is over. you hear me?

134
00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:52.606
Let go.

135
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.941
Or what? What are you gonna do?

136
00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.445
Stop! Andy! Stop!

137
00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.404
Hey!

138
00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:06.745
Well. well.

139
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:08.997
If it isn't the traitor.

140
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.754
Remember that time
my sister kicked your balls so hard.

141
00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:17.214
you limped for a week?

142
00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:19.925
Yeah. if you touch Dustin again.

143
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:23.011
I'll kick 'em so hard
they'll pop like water balloons.

144
00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.638
I say kick away.

145
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.264
Stop this meathead from reproducing

146
00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:29.309
and further infecting the world
with his unique brand of idiocy.

147
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:38.360
Hope you brought a change of clothes.
No one wants to see that shit.

148
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.248
You've gotta stop provoking them. man.

149
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.124
Oh. so this is my fault?

150
00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:56.086
-For what? Wearing a T-shirt?
-You know it's more than a T-shirt.

151
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.046
I can't be like you
and turn the other cheek

152
00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.882
while they spread their bullshit
about Hellfire. about Eddie.

153
00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:02.092
Eddie never gave a rat's ass

154
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.469
about what those mouth breathers
were saying about him.

155
00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:07.222
What he would care about
is finding and killing Vecna.

156
00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.351
Do you seriously think
I don't care about that. Mike? Really?

157
00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.937
I think you're fighting two battles.
You need to be fighting one.

158
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.815
Mike's right. Dustin.
What if you get seriously hurt?

159
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.191
You're drawing attention.

160
00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:21.778
Remember what Hop said.
We need to keep our heads down.

161
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.614
-Follow the rules. Blend in.
-Stay focused on our next crawl.

162
00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.449
Do you even hear yourselves right now?

163
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:30.036
Blend in? Follow the rules?
That's not what we've ever done.

164
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.414
-Jesus Christ.
-We stay true to ourselves.

165
00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.457
We're supposed to stay true
to our friends.

166
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.586
We stand up for what's right.
no matter the cost.

167
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:38.879
You're not listening to us.

168
00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.131
No. you're not.

169
00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.591
Dustin!

170
00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.719
-Unbelievable.
-Let him go.

171
00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:16.833
Come on.

172
00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:17.834
Move. move!

173
00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.394
You're a fast little shit. huh?

174
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.277
It's not her.

175
00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.030
Another goddamn burnout. sir.

176
00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.533
Get her out of here.

177
00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.247
Shit!

178
00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.034
Twelve minutes. 33 seconds.

179
00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.327
It's a new record.

180
00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:40.583
So? How are we feeling?

181
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:41.543
Okay.

182
00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.044
Okay?

183
00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.964
Come on. that was 12:33!

184
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.424
It's four seconds too slow.

185
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.718
I lost one second on the climb.
two seconds at the log.

186
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.137
-Hey.
-I can make my bus jump sooner.

187
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.306
That'll save me two more seconds.
That gets me under 12:30.

188
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.018
El. you have to take it easy on yourself.

189
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.437
-You think Henry's going easy?
-You know what I think?

190
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.816
I think we still have
some more of that waffle mix.

191
00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:09.738
And I think we should celebrate
this record time with a stack of those.

192
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:14.659
And then maybe we could watch
a Miami Vice marathon.

193
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.455
I can beat the time. Reset it.

194
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.499
If you're tired.
you're gonna injure yourself.

195
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.417
Reset it!

196
00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:42.937
Heads up!

197
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.742
Hey. hey. How you doing?

198
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:59.788
Austin Millbarge. ID 4528-niner.

199
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.998
That's me.

200
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:21.101
I swear to God.
this stupid thing does not exist.

201
00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.520
-Can someone try Dustin again?
-He turned off his walkie.

202
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.647
-What's up with him lately?
-Don't get me started.

203
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.898
Yeah. please don't.

204
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.149
-Hey!
-Huh?

205
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.026
Got it.

206
00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.200
Wait. wait. wait. There it is. yeah.

207
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.701
Remote radio head. yeah.

208
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:44.040
And. uh. where exactly are we gonna find
this remote thingamajig?

209
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.173
I don't see it.

210
00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.759
It's up there somewhere.

211
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:55.927
It's gotta be.

212
00:18:56.469 --> 00:19:01.558
So. I guess somebody's gotta climb
to the tippy top of this bad boy and…

213
00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:06.354
Without a harness or anything.
it seems kind of dangerous.

214
00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:10.066
AKA job for good old Steve Harrington.

215
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.985
-No third person. please.
-All right.

216
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.444
I. uh…

217
00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:16.739
I actually think this might be
a better job for Jonathan Byers.

218
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:21.202
I'm like one quarter monkey. dude.
I got this. Byers. Don't sweat it.

219
00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.206
Uh. voltage!

220
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.916
Unless you wanna fry.

221
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.001
Yeah. I know.

222
00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:30.295
I'm not an idiot.

223
00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.392
Whoa. dude. what are you doing?

224
00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:47.353
I got this. dude. Don't sweat it.

225
00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:48.813
Son of a…

226
00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:03.578
What is it about your presence
that brings out their inner Neanderthal?

227
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.583
I thought grocery delivery
wasn't till tomorrow.

228
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.418
Me too.

229
00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.632
Ah. come on. Come on.

230
00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:36.778
Shit.

231
00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.824
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

232
00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:48.623
Found ya.

233
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:54.462
Never fails.

234
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.298
-I fixed it!
-I fixed it!

235
00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:07.600
All right.

236
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.772
Santa's brought a full sack today.

237
00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:20.405
A fresh telemetry tag.
Scarcer than hen's teeth. these things.

238
00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.244
Enough bullets and shells
for Hop to start a small war.

239
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.538
if he should so choose.

240
00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.416
Anyone order a salad?

241
00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.127
Grenade salad?

242
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.463
I hid the grenades under the. uh. lettuce.

243
00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:39.257
Okay.

244
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.468
Gatorade for El's battery.

245
00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:43.803
Did someone say Gatorade?

246
00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.264
-Let me get one. Thanks.
-Sure.

247
00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:49.017
But I don't think
it's gonna go too well with…

248
00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:51.811
peanut butter!

249
00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:54.605
Boppers! God. I missed these things.

250
00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:55.648
Thanks.

251
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.900
Don't worry. Mr. Byers.
I got you a present too.

252
00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.403
I know you're allergic to jazz.

253
00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:04.365
but just give it a whirl.
I think you'll find it quite engaging.

254
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.955
And for the station manager.
the reason for my premature delivery.

255
00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:19.172
A burn? Tonight? But that's--

256
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.298
Too soon. I know.

257
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:24.927
Whatever they're doing in the Upside Down
evidently needs serious resources.

258
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:26.471
That's a lot of cargo.

259
00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:31.017
I figure a supply drop this big
takes two hours. minimum.

260
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.561
Which gives Hopper
plenty of time for a crawl.

261
00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:38.983
Maybe tonight's the night
we finally find that bastard and end this.

262
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:10.014
Hey there. Jake.

263
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:13.309
You up for a little field trip?

264
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:19.273
I'm telling you. he's lost his mind.

265
00:23:19.357 --> 00:23:21.567
He told me
he wanted to start Hellfire again.

266
00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:23.319
What? When did he say that?

267
00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:27.156
This weekend. He was talking
about finding the lost sheep.

268
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.117
And we thought the shirt was bad.

269
00:23:29.617 --> 00:23:31.828
I'm telling you. he's lost his damn mind.

270
00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:34.330
Who's lost his damn mind?

271
00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.624
-Uh. the--
-Andy!

272
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:37.583
-Andy!
-Andy.

273
00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.127
-Andy lost his mind.
-Yeah.

274
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.962
Like when he came at you this morning.

275
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.630
-Yeah. that was--
-Messed up.

276
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:43.631
Yeah.

277
00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:45.341
It's rude.

278
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:51.431
Hey there. friends. this is Rockin' Robin.

279
00:23:51.514 --> 00:23:54.225
Sorry about the abrupt departure.
I hope you survived without me.

280
00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:57.353
We had some annoying
technical difficulties.

281
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.108
But to make it up to you.
we have a very special treat

282
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:05.361
that's sure to turn your day upside down…

283
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.322
-Holy shit.
-Already?

284
00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:09.490
Paper! Give me paper!

285
00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:12.994
Come on! Will. hurry up!

286
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:15.621
You're giving love instinctively

287
00:24:15.705 --> 00:24:19.375
Before you start bumping.
here's a few fun facts about the Boss.

288
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:22.378
She was born Diane
in the North End of Detroit.

289
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:26.674
Berry Gordy. that's Gordy with a G.
signed her to Motown in 1961.

290
00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:28.676
And one is the key number.

291
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:30.678
because between 1964 and '67.

292
00:24:30.761 --> 00:24:33.431
the Supremes had ten songs
hit the top of the charts.

293
00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.974
That's right. ten.

294
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:38.144
Then in '78. she tried to make it big
in the movies with The Wiz.

295
00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:40.354
which was a colossal flop-a-roonie.

296
00:24:40.438 --> 00:24:43.149
But. in my personal opinion.
I still dig it.

297
00:24:43.232 --> 00:24:44.984
Michael Jackson as a scarecrow?

298
00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:46.444
Give it a chance.

299
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:48.446
But make sure you bring
your super-sized popcorn.

300
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:51.991
because this movie has a run time
of over two hours.

301
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:53.743
All right. class dismissed.

302
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.704
I hope you were taking notes.
There will be a test later.

303
00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:57.788
Take it away. Diane.

304
00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.000
Upside down

305
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:03.211
Crawl tonight.

306
00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:04.295
Come on.

307
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:05.755
Inside out

308
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:08.090
'Round and 'round

309
00:25:08.174 --> 00:25:10.176
Upside down

310
00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:14.514
Boy. you turn me inside out

311
00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:16.807
And 'round and 'round

312
00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:20.394
I know you got charm and appeal

313
00:25:20.478 --> 00:25:22.063
You always play the field

314
00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:25.274
I'm crazy to think you're all mine

315
00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:30.446
As long as the sun continues to shine

316
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.658
There's a place in my heart for you
That's the bottom line

317
00:25:54.554 --> 00:25:55.680
All right.

318
00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:58.766
So. assuming Murray's intel is correct.

319
00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:02.311
the supply convoy is set
to reach Hawkins at 10:00 sharp.

320
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:04.730
Meaning I want Hopper in the tunnels

321
00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:07.525
and en route to MAC-Z no later than 9:00.

322
00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:09.819
Lucas. we'll take
our usual observation post.

323
00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:11.821
Barring unusual traffic.

324
00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:14.407
I expect the convoy
to reach MAC-Z at 10:15.

325
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.450
Once the burn starts
and there's sufficient cover.

326
00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:18.160
we'll signal Hopper. who'll make his move.

327
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.247
And now the crawl begins.

328
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.624
Hop is now in the Upside Down.

329
00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:26.752
traveling at what I hope to be
a gentle 30 miles an hour.

330
00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:27.670
which will allow…

331
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:30.047
…you and Harrington to follow along
in the Rightside Up.

332
00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:32.675
Just remember.
try and keep the telemetry signal within…

333
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.803
Negative 60 and negative 70 dB.
Easy-peasy.

334
00:26:35.886 --> 00:26:38.389
I expect the convoy
to take the same route as last month.

335
00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.558
Main to Cornwallis. one turn.

336
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:42.351
But if you guys hit any red lights…

337
00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:44.604
-I'll blow through.
-Only if there's no MPs around.

338
00:26:44.687 --> 00:26:48.733
Remember. if you guys get pulled over.
we lose Hop. we're toast.

339
00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:49.900
I got it.

340
00:26:49.984 --> 00:26:53.112
You're gonna travel up Cornwallis
for about six miles.

341
00:26:53.613 --> 00:26:56.157
And as the convoy reaches
this Shell station here…

342
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.867
We radio Hop to disembark.

343
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.119
Which will drop the old man
at the border of G1.

344
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:05.541
Where he'll have two whole hours
to search for Vecna. which is ample time.

345
00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:07.877
He's cleared zones much faster.

346
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.548
So. all in all.
signs point to another successful crawl.

347
00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:15.885
Is there a problem?

348
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.137
Um…

349
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:22.058
No. No. I mean. I think it's good.

350
00:27:22.642 --> 00:27:25.019
Yeah. yeah. it's good. It's really good.

351
00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:26.103
It's just. um…

352
00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:30.107
Zone G1 is not that exciting or Vecna-y.

353
00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:32.985
What does it have?
A Circuit City. a couple of houses. and a…

354
00:27:33.069 --> 00:27:37.073
Big Buy? What are the chances
Vecna's shopping for Lucky Charms?

355
00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:38.908
It doesn't matter. We stick to the plan.

356
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:41.786
We break into the Upside Down
the only way we can.

357
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:44.121
through the MAC-Z gate.
under the cover of a burn.

358
00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:47.083
Once inside. we search
one zone at a time. methodically.

359
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:49.085
until we figure out
where he's been hiding.

360
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:50.670
Unless…

361
00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.089
he's already dead.

362
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:55.424
Again. your plan is great. It's just…

363
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.344
This is crawl what? Are we in the 30s now?

364
00:27:58.427 --> 00:27:59.929
And not a single baddie in sight?

365
00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:02.139
El can't find him in her bath.

366
00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:04.809
and Will hasn't had his goosies
since the shake 'n' quake.

367
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:06.644
-Goosies?
-And last we saw Vecna.

368
00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:08.854
he was roasting like a turkey
and pumped full of lead.

369
00:28:08.938 --> 00:28:10.606
That was before he fell three stories.

370
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.983
So you ever think
we're scouring a battlefield

371
00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:15.736
that we already. like. won?

372
00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.864
Have you forgotten what he showed Nancy?
Hawkins on fire.

373
00:28:18.948 --> 00:28:21.200
-Karen. Holly. everyone dead.
-Yeah. man.

374
00:28:21.283 --> 00:28:24.453
He also showed Max her brother
walking around with a hole in his chest.

375
00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:27.039
That's what he does. He gets in your head
and tries to scare you.

376
00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:30.793
He did a good job because I am scared.
And you should be scared too.

377
00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:34.046
Because if he's still out there.
he's planning to end our world. so…

378
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.675
We don't stop looking.
Even if it takes 100 more crawls. 1.000.

379
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:39.635
We don't stop until we're goddamn sure

380
00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:44.682
that wrinkled. noseless. rotting bastard
is dead and gone and never coming back.

381
00:28:46.142 --> 00:28:47.184
Everyone in?

382
00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:57.403
I want to see Vecna's heart on a platter.

383
00:28:58.237 --> 00:28:59.655
Just wish I could do it myself.

384
00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:01.907
For Eddie.

385
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:03.200
-For Eddie.
-For Eddie.

386
00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:06.495
On three. "kill Vecna." One. two. three.

387
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:07.580
Kill Vecna!

388
00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:11.125
Oh no!

389
00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:16.297
-Military man.
-Wanted to see if you had my back.

390
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.467
Yeah. I have your back.

391
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:55.961
-Will!
-Will!

392
00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:57.046
Will!

393
00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:59.965
-Hey. are you okay?
-Yeah. it's okay. I'm fine.

394
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:01.801
Was it him? Was it Vecna?

395
00:30:01.884 --> 00:30:04.053
I don't know.
I just had this crazy feeling.

396
00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:06.347
and then the sky was spinning. and…

397
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:10.059
I don't know.
I guess maybe it's nothing. right?

398
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.686
I don't know.

399
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:16.315
Maybe I just get nervous sometimes
before crawls.

400
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:18.192
Yeah. I… I get nervous too.

401
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:20.903
But the sky doesn't spin for me.

402
00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:22.780
It ever spin for you?

403
00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:24.907
Maybe he's close.

404
00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:31.664
Okay. Squawk. six o'clock.
not a second later. right?

405
00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:32.832
-Six o'clock.
-Are you okay?

406
00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:33.833
-Yeah.
-You sure?

407
00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:35.793
-Take it slow.
-Okay. yeah.

408
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:46.595
I'm just trying to get it started.
Ready? Here we go. Come on.

409
00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:51.350
I just gotta get this going.
and then we're gonna have lots of fun.

410
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:53.060
Blast off!

411
00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:54.687
Derek. stop! Come on! Get off!

412
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.605
-Derek. stop!
-Hold on tight!

413
00:30:56.689 --> 00:30:59.149
-Go away! Derek!
-Try not to puke!

414
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:00.317
Stop!

415
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:03.320
-Jerk face!
-Bite me.

416
00:31:03.404 --> 00:31:04.738
You okay? Come here.

417
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:06.615
Let's get you off.

418
00:31:06.699 --> 00:31:08.576
Oh my… Careful. careful!

419
00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:10.035
You okay?

420
00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:12.872
All right. my dears. playtime's over.

421
00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:14.999
Come on.

422
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:17.918
What is with that grumpy face?

423
00:31:18.002 --> 00:31:23.966
Come on. we have books to read.
art to create. wisdom to unlock.

424
00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:28.345
Holly?

425
00:31:31.974 --> 00:31:32.933
Hi.

426
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.854
And she can tell Derek to go away too.

427
00:31:36.937 --> 00:31:38.981
He is a jerk face.

428
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.984
Oh yeah. Miss Harris gave me…

429
00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:48.032
But she also said
it wasn't really my fault.

430
00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:23.400
Are you just
going to stand there. Sergeant Ramirez.

431
00:32:23.484 --> 00:32:25.903
or did you have something to report?

432
00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.237
Sorry. Dr. Kay.

433
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:29.615
Yes. Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan.

434
00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:31.784
he tracked down
that lead we spoke about. and--

435
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:34.328
It was a tremendous success.

436
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:36.080
No. unfortunately.

437
00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:39.625
I see
they don't teach sarcasm in the ROTC.

438
00:32:42.795 --> 00:32:46.131
If it was good news.
Sullivan would be here himself.

439
00:32:46.215 --> 00:32:49.468
with trumpets and confetti.
I have no doubt.

440
00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:53.430
Don't worry. It doesn't bite.

441
00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:56.266
It does. on occasion. strangle.

442
00:32:58.352 --> 00:32:59.728
Was there anything else?

443
00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:03.565
A new lead. perhaps.
to offer more false hope?

444
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:04.942
Not yet. Doctor.

445
00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:09.780
Sergeant.

446
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:16.078
Please tell your commander
that I am running into a wall here.

447
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:19.039
People are dying. innocent people.

448
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:22.668
I need the girl.

449
00:33:49.403 --> 00:33:50.988
The last run. what was my time?

450
00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:55.284
I'm not sure. I didn't see.
I was distracted by Diana Ross.

451
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:56.994
I saved four seconds.

452
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:58.454
Highly doubt that.

453
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:00.247
No. no. it was very fast.

454
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.125
One second on the climb.
one with the log. two on the bus.

455
00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:05.335
Great. You did that today.
You can do it again tomorrow.

456
00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:09.214
The crawl is tonight. Hop.
If I'm under 12:30. I can come with you.

457
00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:12.760
-That is what you promised.
-Yeah. I promised that. I promised it.

458
00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:14.636
But I didn't see it.

459
00:34:15.888 --> 00:34:17.765
So blame Diana.

460
00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:34.448
You didn't think
I could make the time. did you?

461
00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:37.618
I think you can. but no. not today.
I don't think you made that time.

462
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.203
Are you saying that I lie?

463
00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:41.038
No. I'm saying you're mistaken.

464
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:42.623
I'm not mistaken.

465
00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:45.375
Okay. so you're on your sixth run.

466
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.795
you're totally drained.

467
00:34:47.878 --> 00:34:52.549
and you just happen to break
your second record of the day.

468
00:34:52.633 --> 00:34:54.218
right before a crawl.

469
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:55.427
I don't think so. kid.

470
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:59.515
You saw the time. I saw you look down.
You have to let me go with you.

471
00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:01.517
You want to find Henry so bad. don't you?

472
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.518
So bad.

473
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:04.561
Do it. Do it from the tub.

474
00:35:05.062 --> 00:35:06.438
Do it remotely.

475
00:35:06.939 --> 00:35:09.858
You're not coming with me. Not today.

476
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:11.652
End of story.

477
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.458
Why are you being so hard on her?

478
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:28.585
I'm not being hard on her.

479
00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:32.172
She's just trying to help.

480
00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:33.715
It'd be great if Will could help.

481
00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:36.260
but you keep that kid
wrapped in bubble wrap.

482
00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:38.303
Come on. That's different.

483
00:35:38.387 --> 00:35:39.763
I mean. El…

484
00:35:39.847 --> 00:35:43.058
Look at her. She's… She's ready.

485
00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:45.853
Thirty-seven crawls.

486
00:35:45.936 --> 00:35:49.189
The only thing I found
down in that damn place are soldiers.

487
00:35:49.273 --> 00:35:50.190
lots of them.

488
00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:52.609
And they're all looking
for one person. El.

489
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:56.321
So there's no reason to put her life
on the line and bring her down there.

490
00:35:56.405 --> 00:35:59.408
especially not for some recon mission.

491
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:03.662
Well. if it's just some recon mission.
then what's with all the guns?

492
00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:05.956
It's in case I run into trouble.

493
00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:08.167
-Yeah. or in case you run into him.
-No.

494
00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:12.171
I run into that psychic freak.
I'm tucking tail and running.

495
00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:17.050
I'm nuts. I'm nuts. But I'm not that nuts.

496
00:36:22.598 --> 00:36:26.435
I'm gonna need El.
I know that. I know that.

497
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:30.939
Which is precisely why
there's no point in risking her life

498
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.193
over some stupid recon crap.

499
00:36:36.987 --> 00:36:41.283
I want her primed. but I want her safe.
Safe until the very last minute. okay?

500
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.536
Yeah. okay.

501
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:49.291
But her time on that last run.

502
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:50.792
did she make it?

503
00:36:52.586 --> 00:36:54.129
With a second to spare.

504
00:37:34.962 --> 00:37:36.713
See what Donna was wearing?

505
00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:38.674
She's gone up like two sizes
since last year.

506
00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:40.884
-Yeah. right.
-Jesus Christ!

507
00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:43.011
Oh my God.

508
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:47.516
It's just a corn snake. dude.
Guys. it's just a corn snake.

509
00:37:49.017 --> 00:37:50.560
You're a pussy. dude.

510
00:37:50.644 --> 00:37:53.272
-Did you piss your pants?
-It's just a snake.

511
00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:56.024
Hey. Andy. is that your new pet?

512
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:57.859
Don't scare him.

513
00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:18.463
Holly!

514
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:20.882
Holly!

515
00:38:29.725 --> 00:38:30.851
Holly.

516
00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:34.563
What are you doing?
Come on. I have to get going.

517
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.023
Sorry.

518
00:38:37.607 --> 00:38:39.067
They told me to wait.

519
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:55.917
Is this about your mystery friend again?

520
00:38:56.001 --> 00:38:57.544
Mr. Whatsit?

521
00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:01.882
He's only trying to help.

522
00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:04.343
Help? How?

523
00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:06.511
By protecting me.

524
00:39:06.595 --> 00:39:10.932
He says that there are
monsters in Hawkins.

525
00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:14.978
and… they like to eat kids like me.

526
00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:17.689
Monsters aren't real. Holly.

527
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:20.359
I don't believe you.

528
00:39:22.778 --> 00:39:25.197
I know you're scared
because of everything that's happened.

529
00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:30.035
With the crazy stories people tell.
I mean. I get scared sometimes too.

530
00:39:30.118 --> 00:39:31.161
No. you don't.

531
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:32.371
Are you kidding?

532
00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:34.456
Everyone in Hawkins is scared shitless.

533
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:36.291
Anyone who says they aren't
are full of it.

534
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:39.586
Like that mouth breather in your class…
What's his name again?

535
00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:41.588
-Derek?
-Yeah. Derek.

536
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:44.174
He probably wets his bed every night.

537
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:49.054
Know who I turn to when I get scared?

538
00:39:58.897 --> 00:39:59.731
Mike the Brave.

539
00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:02.609
He goes on adventures
called dungeon crawls.

540
00:40:02.692 --> 00:40:04.277
What's a dungeon crawl?

541
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:06.905
Basically. he explores
these underground worlds.

542
00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:10.700
where he fights monsters.
evil wizards. sorcerers and stuff.

543
00:40:10.784 --> 00:40:13.328
But Mike the Brave is never scared.

544
00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:17.374
So whenever I'm feeling
frightened or nervous.

545
00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:19.334
I just imagine that he's at my side.

546
00:40:19.418 --> 00:40:20.419
and I feel better.

547
00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:25.048
So maybe the next time you get scared.
you don't need this Mr. Whatsit.

548
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:28.802
Maybe you just need Holly the Heroic.

549
00:40:29.678 --> 00:40:31.263
Holly the Heroic?

550
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:34.808
I was gonna to wait a few more years. but…

551
00:40:44.693 --> 00:40:47.779
She's a cleric.
which means she has divine powers.

552
00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:50.365
She can cast spells of protection
to ward against evil spirits.

553
00:40:50.449 --> 00:40:53.743
and even cooler.
she can cast a dimension door.

554
00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:56.079
which can teleport you
to anywhere you visualize.

555
00:40:57.747 --> 00:40:58.707
I mean. come on.

556
00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.042
Can this lame-o Mr. Whatsit
do any of this?

557
00:41:01.126 --> 00:41:03.044
No.

558
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:07.966
She'll keep you safe. I promise.

559
00:41:12.721 --> 00:41:14.681
It was this weird feeling.

560
00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:18.351
Like something
I really haven't felt before.

561
00:41:18.852 --> 00:41:21.980
Mike thinks it could mean
that maybe Vecna's close.

562
00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:24.858
that he's finally re-emerged.

563
00:41:25.358 --> 00:41:29.029
And if he has.
maybe we'll find him tonight.

564
00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:33.617
What do you think. Lucas?

565
00:41:36.036 --> 00:41:38.914
Yeah. I think
we'll find him this time for sure.

566
00:41:42.042 --> 00:41:43.293
You wanna play the tape?

567
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:45.879
I'm gonna go grab a Coke
or something caffeinated.

568
00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:48.131
because it's gonna be a long night.

569
00:41:48.215 --> 00:41:49.382
You want one?

570
00:41:49.883 --> 00:41:51.801
No. I'm good. Thanks.

571
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:34.427
Robin!

572
00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:37.013
Rockin' Robin!

573
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.479
Okay. So I have good news.
and I have bad news.

574
00:42:44.563 --> 00:42:45.772
What are you doing here?

575
00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:48.358
A good friend once said.
"Bad news first. always."

576
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:50.819
So I have to cancel our date tonight.

577
00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.654
Of course.

578
00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:56.366
But the good news is
I made us a reservation.

579
00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.369
8:00 p.m. tomorrow night at Enzo's.

580
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:05.333
Enzo's? Okay. how exactly
are we gonna be able to afford that?

581
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:07.544
You mean how am I going to afford it?

582
00:43:07.627 --> 00:43:09.546
Because you. my dear.
are paying for nothing.

583
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.381
Double how. then?

584
00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:13.842
I stole money off the dead guy
they just wheeled out.

585
00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:15.677
That's not funny.
His name was Mr. Pentergast.

586
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.720
and he was very nice.

587
00:43:16.803 --> 00:43:18.054
And very rich.

588
00:43:18.138 --> 00:43:21.850
-Robin…
-Look. dinner's on me. okay?

589
00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:26.646
But. uh. maybe for dessert.
I could… I could see you in this hat.

590
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.024
and. like. only this hat.

591
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:32.485
I hate you. I…

592
00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:43.163
Was that on purpose?

593
00:43:43.747 --> 00:43:45.582
-Totally.
-That's so sexy.

594
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:50.420
So. there any chance
I could get you to wear this outfit?

595
00:43:50.503 --> 00:43:51.463
But that's…

596
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:03.266
Who is that?

597
00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:04.726
Shit.

598
00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:33.213
Don't worry. Eddie.
Eventually they'll get bored.

599
00:45:11.376 --> 00:45:13.795
You should really keep a better eye
on your pets. Henderson.

600
00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:17.757
It's dangerous out there.
They shouldn't be left alone like that.

601
00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:20.552
Hey there. freak. Long time no see.

602
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:21.636
Hiya.

603
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:31.521
Something funny. Henderson?

604
00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:34.065
No. I… I was just thinking.

605
00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:36.234
In Eddie's last campaign.

606
00:45:37.736 --> 00:45:40.989
I defeated Vecna's lead acolyte
by casting Prismatic Spray.

607
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.159
One D8 turned up a 7.

608
00:45:44.868 --> 00:45:45.785
Violet.

609
00:45:46.369 --> 00:45:48.705
Is that supposed to be English. freak?

610
00:45:49.456 --> 00:45:53.960
Well. violet Prismatic Spray
is the deadliest. You know why?

611
00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:57.464
It causes blindness.

612
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:01.092
Hey!

613
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.289
Hellfire dies with you. Henderson.

614
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:33.041
And it dies tonight.

615
00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:50.391
Dustin. this is Lucas. Do you copy? Over.

616
00:46:50.475 --> 00:46:53.061
Dustin. do you copy? Over.

617
00:46:54.187 --> 00:46:57.398
Dustin. you're an hour late. man.
You're making us nervous.

618
00:46:57.482 --> 00:46:59.192
We need you here at the Squawk.

619
00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:02.445
Dustin. if you can hear us.
please respond. Over.

620
00:47:02.529 --> 00:47:04.864
I got off the phone with his mom.
She hasn't heard from him.

621
00:47:04.948 --> 00:47:07.617
-Christ. Henderson.
-He'll show. He always shows.

622
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.618
Try him again.

623
00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:11.746
Come in. Dustin. Are you there?
Earth to Dustin.

624
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.998
This is serious. man. Quit playing.
We can't wait around.

625
00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:19.337
Get your ass to the Squawk.

626
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.548
We can't wait around.
We need you here now.

627
00:47:21.631 --> 00:47:23.299
This is not funny. Are you there?

628
00:47:24.384 --> 00:47:26.177
Dustin. is everything okay?

629
00:47:26.803 --> 00:47:29.681
-Do you think Dustin is okay?
-Dustin!

630
00:47:30.598 --> 00:47:31.599
I hope so.

631
00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:34.477
He was acting weird today.

632
00:47:35.395 --> 00:47:37.146
Weird how?

633
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:42.151
Just angry. scared. reckless. Not himself.

634
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:44.821
Hopper's the same.

635
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:46.698
Not himself.

636
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:52.620
Maybe it's just getting to us. you know?

637
00:47:52.704 --> 00:47:56.833
Being… Being stuck in here.
not knowing where Vecna is.

638
00:47:56.916 --> 00:47:58.042
no end in sight.

639
00:47:58.126 --> 00:48:00.837
I mean. we're really starting to lose it.

640
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.798
I mean. we really need to catch a break.

641
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:08.136
And maybe we will.
Because earlier. Will had a feeling.

642
00:48:08.887 --> 00:48:11.389
-If Will has a feeling--
-Then it means something.

643
00:48:11.472 --> 00:48:13.641
So… So. maybe tonight's our break.

644
00:48:13.725 --> 00:48:15.143
Maybe even our last crawl.

645
00:48:15.894 --> 00:48:18.855
We find Vecna.
and we end this once and for all.

646
00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:23.902
And then what happens?

647
00:48:23.985 --> 00:48:26.905
You mean after you totally demolish Vecna?

648
00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:32.285
In my campaigns. if the party wins.
then they all live happily ever after.

649
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:34.954
Happily how?

650
00:48:35.622 --> 00:48:40.793
Well. usually what happens is the party
doesn't return to their local village.

651
00:48:40.877 --> 00:48:42.754
because too much has happened.

652
00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:44.881
They've seen too much.

653
00:48:44.964 --> 00:48:48.217
So they travel to a faraway land.
a… a peaceful land.

654
00:48:48.301 --> 00:48:52.138
somewhere beautiful.
with like three waterfalls or something.

655
00:48:52.847 --> 00:48:55.558
and they all start again. together.

656
00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:01.189
Do you think that could be real for us?

657
00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:03.691
Yeah. of course.

658
00:49:04.943 --> 00:49:09.822
I mean. not the three waterfalls part.
But the other stuff. yeah. of course.

659
00:49:10.949 --> 00:49:14.452
If Vecna's gone. then what's stopping us?

660
00:49:16.746 --> 00:49:19.374
Hey. lovebirds! Chief's almost ready.

661
00:49:19.457 --> 00:49:21.626
Let's do this. Come on.

662
00:49:35.515 --> 00:49:36.516
Thank you.

663
00:49:39.644 --> 00:49:40.645
Here.

664
00:49:40.728 --> 00:49:41.729
Good luck.

665
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:45.441
-Tag's active.
-Copy.

666
00:49:47.735 --> 00:49:50.029
Harrington. you getting any signal?
Tag is active.

667
00:49:51.239 --> 00:49:52.699
Yeah. just give me a second.

668
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:04.043
Hey. anybody know
how Henderson's wheelie thing works?

669
00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:05.920
Uh. any ideas?

670
00:50:06.004 --> 00:50:08.840
There's a safety lock.
Look for a small switch under the wheel.

671
00:50:08.923 --> 00:50:11.718
There should be
a safety lock under the wheel.

672
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:14.262
Safety lock. real necessary.

673
00:50:24.313 --> 00:50:25.314
Okay.

674
00:50:29.402 --> 00:50:30.987
Okay. getting a signal.

675
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:33.239
It's pretty quiet. though.

676
00:50:42.915 --> 00:50:45.501
Okay. signal's holding a steady 90 dB.

677
00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:49.172
But how am I supposed to monitor this
and drive without Henderson?

678
00:50:49.756 --> 00:50:52.091
Uh. hear anything from Inspector Gadget?

679
00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:53.176
Nothing.

680
00:50:53.259 --> 00:50:55.470
I can do it. I… I can monitor.

681
00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:56.846
No. You're staying here.

682
00:50:56.929 --> 00:50:59.599
Mom. I helped Dustin set up the antenna.
I know how to work it.

683
00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:02.185
Out of the question.
It… It's just a wheel.

684
00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.394
It's not just a wheel.

685
00:51:03.478 --> 00:51:05.396
Jonathan. you… you can work it. right?

686
00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:09.984
Yeah. yeah. I mean. I think so.

687
00:51:10.068 --> 00:51:12.278
You better not think. You better know.

688
00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:14.155
You lose me out there.
I'm not coming home.

689
00:51:15.031 --> 00:51:15.990
I can handle it.

690
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.300
You comfortable back there. Byers?

691
00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:37.220
Or you want me to get you a pillow?

692
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:39.722
Just focus on driving.

693
00:52:05.206 --> 00:52:07.834
Try to get back to me in one piece. okay?

694
00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:14.257
What?

695
00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:16.425
Sorry. I'm just looking at you.

696
00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:18.553
You get more beautiful every day.

697
00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:22.682
How is that fair?

698
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:25.184
You didn't answer my question.

699
00:52:25.268 --> 00:52:26.477
I know.

700
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:28.729
You didn't answer mine.

701
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.730
Look. she was standing
at the fence. talking into thin air.

702
00:53:10.813 --> 00:53:12.481
She probably was talking to herself.

703
00:53:12.565 --> 00:53:14.233
…standing there talking to nobody.

704
00:53:14.317 --> 00:53:18.279
Well. she's hardly the first child
to have an imaginary friend. Karen.

705
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:20.656
I wouldn't be so worried
if she was five years old.

706
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.200
but she's not five anymore. is she?

707
00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:25.286
In fact. do you even know
how old your daughter is?

708
00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:27.663
-Oh. you don't even know how old she is!
-You're ridiculous.

709
00:53:27.747 --> 00:53:29.790
I'm not talking to you
when you're like this.

710
00:53:29.874 --> 00:53:32.126
First one tonight.
or already onto number two?

711
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:33.586
Does it matter?

712
00:54:53.582 --> 00:54:56.585
Squawk to Crow's Nest. anything? Over.

713
00:54:56.669 --> 00:54:58.546
Negative. not a peep.

714
00:55:05.177 --> 00:55:06.429
Do you have to chew so loud?

715
00:55:07.013 --> 00:55:08.389
Snipers chew gum.

716
00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:09.807
You're not a sniper.

717
00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:15.646
Package incoming.
Four trucks. outer east gate on Main.

718
00:55:16.272 --> 00:55:20.026
We got action.
Four trucks. outer east gate on Main.

719
00:55:27.074 --> 00:55:28.367
The hole! Clear the hole.

720
00:55:30.119 --> 00:55:32.121
Burners. prepare to deploy.

721
00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:35.624
On my mark! Move. move. move.

722
00:55:35.708 --> 00:55:37.168
Burners heading for the gate.

723
00:55:40.588 --> 00:55:43.758
Burn commencing in five. four.

724
00:55:44.467 --> 00:55:47.178
three. two.

725
00:55:47.762 --> 00:55:49.221
and boom!

726
00:56:05.905 --> 00:56:07.031
Trucks moving in.

727
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:08.574
Trucks moving in.

728
00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:28.427
Am I clear?

729
00:56:31.097 --> 00:56:33.349
-Clear to the east.
-East is clear.

730
00:56:34.058 --> 00:56:35.101
And to the west?

731
00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:40.189
Hold. We got a straggler.

732
00:56:40.981 --> 00:56:41.816
Come on.

733
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:43.484
Get the hell out of there.

734
00:56:43.567 --> 00:56:44.568
Come on.

735
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:50.324
Clear.

736
00:57:01.836 --> 00:57:02.753
He's in.

737
00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:04.171
He's in.

738
00:57:16.642 --> 00:57:18.185
Open sesame.

739
00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:40.040
He's flipped.

740
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:50.134
Jonathan. signal?

741
00:57:57.475 --> 00:57:58.309
Snagged it.

742
00:58:00.144 --> 00:58:02.021
-Should I move?
-No.

743
00:58:02.605 --> 00:58:03.522
Hold.

744
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.942
Hold. Hold.

745
00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:09.862
Hold.

746
00:58:10.446 --> 00:58:11.280
Go!

747
00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:20.039
Van is on the move.

748
00:58:28.172 --> 00:58:30.716
Hopper. can you hear us okay?

749
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:32.593
Yeah. yeah. loud and clear.

750
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.596
Good. good. Okay. hard part's over.

751
00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:39.099
I mean. speak for yourself.
I still gotta jump out of this thing.

752
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.311
And is it me.
or are we moving faster than normal?

753
00:58:42.394 --> 00:58:43.437
A little faster.

754
00:58:43.521 --> 00:58:46.232
Just aim for the grass.

755
00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:49.360
I was gonna go for the asphalt.
but now that you mention the grass--

756
00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:58.744
What's going on? Hopper?

757
00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:00.871
-We're losing him!
-Wait. what?

758
00:59:00.955 --> 00:59:02.373
Wait! Stop! Stop!

759
00:59:13.384 --> 00:59:14.510
We got him.

760
00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:19.098
Hopper. do you copy?

761
00:59:19.682 --> 00:59:20.599
Hopper!

762
00:59:21.475 --> 00:59:23.060
Yeah. I copy.

763
00:59:23.143 --> 00:59:24.728
What the hell happened?

764
00:59:24.812 --> 00:59:27.606
I don't know. We just slammed to a stop.

765
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.733
Wh… Why would they stop?

766
00:59:30.401 --> 00:59:31.527
The soldiers…

767
00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:34.196
they know he's there.

768
00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:36.782
We don't know that.

769
00:59:43.664 --> 00:59:45.624
What's going on over there?

770
00:59:49.962 --> 00:59:51.088
There are too many.

771
00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:53.215
He can't take them.

772
01:00:12.318 --> 01:00:13.694
Whoa!

773
01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.926
-The hell's happening?
-I don't know.

774
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.810
Will! No!

775
01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:28.852
Honey!

776
01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:32.523
Will! Will! Will!

777
01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.772
Squawk. do you copy?

778
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.608
Joyce? Anyone?

779
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.631
Will. Will. come back! Come on. honey.

780
01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.217
Will. come back. Come back.

781

783
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.740
Come back! Come back!

784
01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.242
Will. sweetie. It's okay.

785
01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:08.786
Mom!

786
01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.079
It's okay. It's okay.

787
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.999
I'm here. I'm here.

788
01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.627
It's okay. Just breathe. Just breathe.

789
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.921
What happened?

790
01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.342
I saw it.

791
01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.761
What? What did you see?

792
01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.387
The Demogorgon.

793
01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:31.683
It's coming. It's coming for them.

794
01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:34.603
For who? Who's them?

795
01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:44.446
Robin. stay here.

796
01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.199
Contact Hopper. the boys.
Tell everyone what's going on.

797
01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.242
Right. Right.

798
01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.536
-Think you can get the power back on?
-I can try.

799
01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:53.872
You do. you call my house
and tell everyone to get the hell out.

800
01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:54.790
Okay.

801
01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:23.086
Mom!

802
01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:26.465

803
01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:52.324
