00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.402
-What's up. boy? All good?
-All good.

3
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.320
All good. All good. gentlemen.

4
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.079
Let's go!

5
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:56.924
Come on. hurry up.

6
00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:04.113
Let's go. white boy.

7
00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.009
Stop right there. white boy.

8
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.525
All good. Go ahead. Go on.

9
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:19.987
Let's go.

10
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.218
I feel like I know this gringo.

11
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:46.597
-No shit. from where?
-From Baja.

12
00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.683
I think he's the White Devil.

13
00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:52.561
And I have two hands.

14
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:54.772
Man. seriously.

15
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.021
There is a price on his head.

16
00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.193
One second.

17
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.040
Don't play stupid.

18
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:01.547
Cocksucker!

19
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:11.014
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

20
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:08.572
Get in. Hurry the fuck up!
What are you looking at? Ass...

21
00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:29.314
The employees understand now
that they have new management.

22
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.611
Well. you were right.
The place was full of fentanyl.

23
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.656
But don't worry. We are clearing it out.

24
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.825
Okay. we are in control.

25
00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.952
Well. I don't know about that. Tracy.

26
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:46.164
But. look. there's some clean coke
that we can turn into cash.

27
00:11:46.248 --> 00:11:49.000
Oh. Tracy. Tracy. Don't worry. Tracy.

28
00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.044
I may have a surprise for you.

29
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:56.091
No. no. no.
But I have some new connections.

30
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.969
Don't give me that bullshit.

31
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.425
Fuck no. Back to the cell.

32
00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.146
THE GRINGO
OR THE WIDOW

33
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.744
What can I say?

34
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.699
Hey. I'm never wrong. Tracy.

35
00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.291
This one first.

36
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.334
Or this one better.

37
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:47.460
What's up?

38
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.671
-Hello.
-What's up. brother?

39
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.882
-Andro. Good. How are you?
-Good. and you? Oh. well.

40
00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.467
-Hello.
-What's up?

41
00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:57.554
-I'll say hello in a bit.
-No. Dude. it's coming out...

42
00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.889
-No. Yes. please.
-Let's see.

43
00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.632
-Look how it came out.
-Yes. I saw.

44
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:08.606
-What are you saying? I was here first.
-Yes. my leftovers.

45
00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:11.485
-Bro. how are you? All good?
-Very good.

46
00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:12.569
My love.

47
00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:15.989
Want a beer?

48
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.240
Angie. come in.

49
00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.830
Sometimes I clean up.

50
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:27.500
Niña. Feli. how are you all? Hello.

51
00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:30.336
Listen. we have a new mystery to solve.

52
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.421
-Let's see.
-Let's see.

53
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.715
I need to know
who the real father of this child is.

54
00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.885
-Come on. dude.
-Take a look.

55
00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.137
-Because he's not yours.
-Why?

56
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.847
He's too cute. look at him.

57
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.142
Take a look at me. we're identical.

58
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.019
The baby is not wearing a wig.

59
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.252
Let's see. Let me take a look at him.
Come on. let's see.

60
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.901
Handsome. tall.

61
00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.779
-That's why. Whose child is it?
-No. he does look like you.

62
00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:58.490
He does look like you.
He's gonna suffer a shitload. Poor guy.

63
00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:00.700
-Why is he going to suffer?
-Just look at him.

64
00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.160
He's gonna be very attractive.

65
00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.412
No. he's identical to his mother.

66
00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:07.374
-How did you fall for this?
-Help me out. They're picking on me.

67
00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.251
Of course he's going to look like him.

68
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.920
-No doubt.
-You had it well hidden.

69
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.841
Anybody wants a beer? No?

70
00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:19.052
Some water? Nothing? Yes?

71
00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:21.346
Hon. tell him already.

72
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.015
I think it's time you told him. Ask him.

73
00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.100
Right now. it's a good time. Okay?

74
00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.269
-Okay.
-It's going to be okay.

75
00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:33.024
Andro. can I talk to you?

76
00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:34.525
Yes. of course.

77
00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.030
What's wrong?

78
00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.367
I have something crucial to ask you.

79
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.452
The baby's not mine.

80
00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:46.579
Talk to Clavo. You know how that dude is.

81
00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:50.125
Look. you know I don't have any brothers.

82
00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.126
Not by blood at least.

83
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.586
And I wanted to ask you...

84
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.129
What do you need?

85
00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.676
Feliciana and I...

86
00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:04.722
were wondering if you'd do us the honor
of being Leonardo's godfather.

87
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.643
-If it's too much...
-The honor is mine.

88
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.395
Really?

89
00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.278
Set a day and time
and we throw him to the river.

90
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.239
Andro. if I were you.
I'd be a little more careful. okay?

91
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:25.743
Because Feliciana hasn't touched
this boy in a long while.

92
00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:26.953
Are you jealous?

93
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.747
-A little.
-Get in here.

94
00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.668
Love. he said yes!

95
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:40.174
-Let's toast to that.
-Tequila. tequila.

96
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.635
-Cheers. family.
-Cheers.

97
00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:43.803
Party's over.

98
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:46.931
We have work tomorrow.

99
00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:48.641
Oh. well.

100
00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:58.317
Attention!

101
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.696
Good morning. Continue.

102
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.907
Congratulations.

103
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.118
Do we know if it's a girl or a boy?

104
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:09.746
-Thank you. commander. It's a boy.
-Very well.

105
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.832
That little one is going to be
a future gringo hunter.

106
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.010
A prisoner transport?

107
00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:26.804
This prisoner requires special security.

108
00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:32.518
No shit. it's the White Devil.

109
00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:35.938
Who's the White Devil?

110
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:38.024
The White Devil. from La Misión.

111
00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:40.629
The one who busted up the Baja Cartel?

112
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.403
That one.

113
00:22:43.738 --> 00:22:45.531
White Devil or Black Angel.

114
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.700
It doesn't matter. Get ready!

115
00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:49.827
Are you sure he's the White Devil?

116
00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:53.951
I'm sure. My uncle was in charge
of the team that arrested him in Baja.

117
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:58.044
Andro. I need a second with you.

118
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.631
Sir. I need a bathroom break.

119
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.257
Go ahead.

120
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:10.640
-Clavo. you're driving.
-Yes. sir.

121
00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:24.946
Hello.

122
00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:31.077
STATE POLICE

123
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:56.686
Rolling with one.

124
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:36.267
All clear.

125
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.244
No signal around here.

126
00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:02.788
Again.

127
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.463
What?

128
00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:12.131
He likes fresh air.

129
00:28:44.265 --> 00:28:45.724
Angelica. let's go. now!

130
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.450
Angelica. that's a fucking order!

131
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.501
Cover me!

132
00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:19.967
Covering!

133
00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:27.266
Red!

134
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:29.477
Green! Cover me!

135
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:01.634
Let's go.

136
00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:19.860
-Three.
-Are you sure?

137
00:30:19.944 --> 00:30:21.651
The gringo and the police officers?

138
00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:26.408
How many left. Kiko?

139
00:30:26.492 --> 00:30:29.411
Three. The gringo and two cops.

140
00:30:29.495 --> 00:30:31.247
They lost them in the jungle.

141
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:41.674
Make sure to block the entrances
to the town

142
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:44.593
because these fuckers
will probably want to ask for help.

143
00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:45.803
Done.

144
00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:48.180
-Come on. let's go.
-Yes. sir.

145
00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:51.016
Filero. Filerito.

146
00:30:53.978 --> 00:30:55.646
We're going hunting. dude.

147
00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:57.815
Let's go. boys!

148
00:33:39.184 --> 00:33:40.519
Hey! I need everyone to answer.

149
00:33:40.602 --> 00:33:42.104
Let's go. boys! Let's go!

150
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:44.315
I need communication
with all the available units.

151
00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:47.484
These gringos turned this
into a shitshow. again.

152
00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:07.421
My radio is not working.

153
00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:39.870
Andro. he is right.

154
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:45.959
Give me his weapon.

155
00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:40.180
That one will knock out
the cellular and landlines.

156
00:35:40.264 --> 00:35:42.224
Who's the owner of the store?

157
00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:45.102
You're closed.

158
00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:49.731
If you see a white guy
and two cops let me know.

159
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:52.484
Here's some cash for them.

160
00:35:55.571 --> 00:35:56.697
Be on alert.

161
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:09.710
Off with you. ladies. it's closed.

162
00:36:09.793 --> 00:36:12.963
PILLY GROCERIES

163
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.089
Hit it.

164
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:18.176
How many more?

165
00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:30.981
Let's go!

166
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:11.021
Gentlemen! I got news! Come closer!

167
00:37:13.023 --> 00:37:14.232
Come. come!

168
00:37:15.943 --> 00:37:18.654
The syndicate offers 100.000 pesos

169
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:21.156
to the one who tells me
where the damn gringo is

170
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:24.368
with his two helpers dressed as cops.

171
00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:27.162
Who wants to earn that money?

172
00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:28.664
Let's go. come on!

173
00:37:59.695 --> 00:38:02.781
If we don't move fast.
we're going to get fucked.

174
00:38:02.864 --> 00:38:04.950
There are tens of men looking for us.

175
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:08.495
Some have machetes.
others have handguns. long guns.

176
00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:11.373
They are focusing
on the hunt around the river.

177
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:17.629
Andro. he's right.

178
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.561
They have probably
knocked out the antennas.

179
00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:28.366
Andro. what do you think?

180
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.956
I think that those sons of whores
killed our brothers.

181
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.961
If we try to negotiate with them.
they'll kill us too.

182
00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:49.158
And this gringo is more useful
as a soldier than as a prisoner.

183
00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:34.307
Not yet.
but we're going to send up a drone.

184
00:41:55.889 --> 00:41:56.765
Sir.

185
00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:01.687
When we get to Tracy.
everybody. keep your trap shut.

186
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.146
I'll do the talking. okay?

187
00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:05.899
She's going to be pissed off. boss.

188
00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:08.402
And more so because
we're not bringing the gringo to her.

189
00:42:08.485 --> 00:42:11.363
who. by the way. I want caught alive.

190
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:15.575
Turn the rest into paste. if you like.

191
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:17.536
But I want that bastard alive.
you hear me?

192
00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:18.745
All right. sir.

193
00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:21.790
Get ready. dude.

194
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.228
I'll bring him to you tonight
on a silver platter

195
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:45.480
and an apple in his mouth. if you want.

196
00:43:56.509 --> 00:43:57.844
Don't move.

197
00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.054
Throw it!

198
00:44:01.765 --> 00:44:02.724
Easy!

199
00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:04.934
-Hurry!
-All right. easy.

200
00:44:11.858 --> 00:44:13.902
Fucking son of a bitch!

201
00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:29.003
It went through the leg.

202
00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:54.077
The bandage. the bandage.

203
00:44:58.655 --> 00:45:01.032
The bandage. Can you move?

204
00:45:09.749 --> 00:45:11.751
-Can you move?
-Yes. yes. yes.

205
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:14.295
Let's go.

206
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:29.485
Which one is it?

207
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:32.155
-There they are! There they are!
-Have a good day.

208
00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:13.905
Don't die just yet. fucker.

209
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:26.584
Gentlemen. the way I see it.
you have no way out.

210
00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:30.880
Surrender the gringo
and I give you back this piece of shit.

211
00:51:32.548 --> 00:51:33.883
I have it here.

212
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:36.209
If you shoot. they'll kill him for real.

213
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.931
Sergeant Alejandro Escobedo!

214
00:51:40.765 --> 00:51:44.811
I give you my word that if you
give me the gringo. I won't kill you.

215
00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:49.106
Focus! They're going to kill us!

216
00:51:52.819 --> 00:51:54.695
Did I sound convincing. Samuel?

217
00:51:57.031 --> 00:52:02.119
-Are you giving him over to me or not?
-Don't do it! Fuck these assholes!

218
00:52:13.172 --> 00:52:15.716
Welcome to the party. fucker.

219
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:21.347
Get him!

220
00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:25.977
Just like that?

221
00:52:27.854 --> 00:52:30.147
Police officers piss me off.

222
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.391
Cease fire!

223
00:53:10.563 --> 00:53:11.564
Oh. okay.

224
00:53:13.566 --> 00:53:14.775
Assholes.

225
00:53:40.301 --> 00:53:43.471
Hey! Stop the fucking shooting. dumb-ass!

226
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:46.557
Cuervo. fucking damn it. hold your fire!

227
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:51.520
Do you get it. Cuervito.

228
00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:52.438
Yes. sir.

229
00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:55.691
So why the fuck are you trying
to shoot him down. dumb-ass?

230
00:53:55.775 --> 00:53:58.069
I want him alive. do you hear me?

231
00:53:58.152 --> 00:53:59.528
Alive!

232
00:53:59.612 --> 00:54:01.572
You two. come here.

233
00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:05.117
Go to the cabin
and turn those police officers into paste.

234
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.376
Filero. to the alley. dude.

235
00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:14.293
Yes. sir.

236
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.588
-Gato.
-What?

237
00:54:18.506 --> 00:54:20.466
-You're on point now. dude.
-Fuck yeah.

238
00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:05.845
Move!

239
00:55:10.683 --> 00:55:11.726
Let's go.

240
00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:34.040
I'll cover you.

241
00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:38.461
I'll see how to get out.

242
00:56:14.246 --> 00:56:15.081
At him.

243
00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:22.296
Holy shit!

244
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.637
Close call. bro.

245
00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:41.941
This fucker.

246
00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:44.527
He killed this one.
and he even killed fucking Gato.

247
00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:47.613
This white boy is dead.

248
00:56:50.491 --> 00:56:53.035
Chato. where are the others?

249
00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:00.501
Filero. to the river. now.

250
00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:02.503
Gato?

251
00:57:04.338 --> 00:57:05.506
Gatito?

252
00:57:06.924 --> 00:57:08.634
This one is already fucked.

253
00:57:08.717 --> 00:57:09.802
Kiko?

254
00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:14.598
No. no. no. dude.
This fucker is killing everybody.

255
00:57:14.682 --> 00:57:17.351
Don't even try. We're on our way.

256
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:18.644
You go with me.

257
00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:20.438
And you. dude. go see who's still alive.

258
00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:21.939
What about the wounded?

259
00:57:22.565 --> 00:57:24.316
Leave them behind. Let's go.

260
00:57:24.984 --> 00:57:26.068
Hurry up. dude!

261
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:49.550
Fucking damn it.

262
00:57:50.426 --> 00:57:52.303
There's no way. dude!

263
00:57:52.386 --> 00:57:54.847
We're twenty fucking guys
and we can't catch a fucker!

264
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:58.309
That's why I wanted to kill him!
But no. damn Tracy.

265
00:58:00.102 --> 00:58:01.562
What the fuck is with that?

266
00:59:11.382 --> 00:59:13.050
Son of a bitch!

267
00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:16.804
White Devil?

268
00:59:51.714 --> 00:59:54.800
No. you're the White Devil. dude.

269
01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.552
Shit. this dude is right.

270
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:23.514
Devil?

271
01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:26.600
Little Devil?

272
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:35.651
Kiko. clear the alley. I'm on my way.

273
01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.236
Fucking hurry. dude.

274
01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.162
Let's go. Nando!

275
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.210
Where were you assholes?

276
01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.130
You mean we are the only three left?

277
01:01:58.382 --> 01:01:59.591
What are you aiming for?

278
01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:01.844
This is over. let's hit the fucking road.

279
01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:02.928
Let's go. Cuervo.

280
01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.524
I like this fucking gringo.

281
01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.756
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

282
01:03:35.354 --> 01:03:36.522
Are you Jake?

283
01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:37.814
What the fuck?

284
01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:50.077
Ah. slowly. slowly!

285
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.137
Open it!

286
01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.767
Phone. Phone in the backpack.

287
01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.106
Dial number one.

288
01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.470
You all know why you're here.

289
01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:37.059
The she-devil is in a hacienda
three kilometers away from here.

290
01:05:37.893 --> 01:05:39.478
I'll take you there!

291
01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.234

Angelica. take the phone.

01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:54.368
Call our people.

294
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.203
After that. hide until they arrive.

295
01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.537
What are you going to do?

296
01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:00.808
I'm going to avenge my brothers.

297
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.126
They are my brothers too.

298
01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:06.838
It's an order.

299
01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:08.757
Let's go.

300
01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:34.408

Samuel. son of a bitch.

303
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:55.163
They'll be heroes to the people.

304
01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:58.291
and we'll take good care
of their families.

305
01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:09.237
-Who is it?
-It's me. dumb-ass.

306
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.613
Hey. Kiko.
