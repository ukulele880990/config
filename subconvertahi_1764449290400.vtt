What are you still doing here?

8
00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.154
I have one hour left
on my shift.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.239
If I get home before 6:00.
Benji will know something's up.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.158
Pretty sure the black eye
is going to give you away.

11
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.826
Well. sadly.
it's not the first time

12
00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.911
I've gone home with
a war wound from a patient.

13
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:38.996
Hey. Doc.

14
00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.706
You got a sandwich?

15
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.000
Uh. you know what. Earl?
I can do you one better.

16
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.002
I'm going to order
Tagari's pizza.

17
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.962
I think we could all use
a morale boost around here.

18
00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.464
No sandwich?

19
00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.049
You could fold it in half.
New York style.

20
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.009
- just like a sandwich.
- Better not be pineapple...

21
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.386
No pineapple. I promise.
Not this time. okay?

22
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.847
We good?

23
00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.017
I say this with all the love
and respect in my heart.

24
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.351
I honestly do.

25
00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.812
- Get the hell out of here.
- You need me.

26
00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.189
The CT came back normal.

Nasal bone just has
a hairline fracture.

28
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.817
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
I don't like it.

29
00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.819
You sound like me.
That's not a good thing.

30
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.237
- Just let me finish my day.
- Okay.

31
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.822
I'm not going to argue with you.

32
00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.157
Yeah. all that knowledge
and still learning.

33
00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.700
- It really is impressive.
- Yes.

34
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.368
Well. can you at least
keep a cold pack on it?

35
00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.912
[sighs] No promises.

36
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.538
I've had so much coffee.
I've got to pee again.

37
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.041
Walk with me... I also need
to fill you in on something.

38
00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.043
- What?
- So Langdon is gone.

39
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.462
- Gone? Where?
- Home.

40
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:31.381
I will handle his caseload.
It won't fall on anybody else.

41
00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.550
And Dr. Ellis usually
comes in early.

42
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.636
I get punched in the face.
and he goes home early?

43
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.179
Nope. It's not like that.
Trust me.

44
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.223
You do not want to be
Langdon right now.

a pharmacy audit on Langdon

49
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.356
I need a list of all
the patients he's treated

50
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.025
and all the medications
he's prescribed.

51
00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.528

- No. you do not.

- Yeah. Are you?

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.577
Honestly. I'm beginning
to have my doubts.

56
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.246

trying to tell you something?

were very long.

this time.

It's okay.
It's okay. Just breathe.

173

All right.
we can try and rush you

but at the rate you're moving.

175

this baby in the elevator.

176
00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:36.121
So what's my other option?

177
00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.747
We deliver your baby here.

178
00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:40.750
Grab a BOA kit
and get a baby warmer in here.

179
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:44.838
Call L and D. and tell them
this baby is coming now!

180
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.090
We're 20 behind in triage.

181
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:49.092
Mateo. treat 'em and street 'em.

182
00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:50.594
See how many you can dispo.

183
00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.220
I hear we're down
a senior resident.

184
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:54.181
- How can I help?
- Oh. yeah? What senior?

185
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.932
Langdon had to go home early
to deal with something.

186
00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:56.975
Robby's covering.

187
00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.310
You can follow Mateo to Chairs.

188
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.061
That's where
we could really use you.

189
00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:02.606
Chairs is about to be my bitch.

190
00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.399
So. D...

191
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.611
is... is this
all about the fight?

192
00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.237
What fight?

193
00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.865
Robby and Langdon got
into it at the lockers.

194
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.783
- Shit was flying.
- Literal shit.

195
00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:17.163
That's enough from you two.
Not another word.

196
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.124
{\an8}Keep it up!

197
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:24.003
You'll both be working
the holidays!

198
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.757
What have we got?

199
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.634
39 weeks. crowning after a SROM.

200
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.511
Hi. Mom.
I'm the attending.

201
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.803
I'm Dr. Robinavitch.

202
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.472
I'm Natalie.
but I'm not the mom.

203
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.973
What's happening?

204
00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:38.475
You got here just in time.

205
00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.935
Uh. we're the dads.

206
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.645
Natalie's my best friend
and surrogate.

207
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.813
We both teach fourth grade
and even share classrooms.

208
00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:45.482
Same room. same womb.

209
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.317
We've been urging her
to stop saying that.

210
00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.443
[laughter]

211
00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.153
I've got the prenatal bag.

212
00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:52.489
and let me pull up the birthing
playlist on my phone.

213
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.865
[chuckles] It's time.

214
00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.785
Fuck Beyoncé. Fuck her.

215
00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.747
I can take this.

216
00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:02.165
No.

217
00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.458
I got it.

218
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:06.002
Go. Dr. Collins.

219
00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:07.462
Okay. Natalie.

220
00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:10.257
Good chance we'll deliver
on the next contraction.

221
00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.592
Bulb suction is ready.

222
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:15.638
[yelling]

223
00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.853
Right.
Head is out!

224
00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:25.188
Nice.
Take a break.

225
00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:27.567
Catch your breath
before the next one.

226
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:30.527
All right.

227
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.029
I'm going to need
another big push from you.

228
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.239
You got this.

229
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.865
Three. two...

230
00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:36.908
[groaning]

231
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:38.868
Who do we have in here?

232
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:42.247
Ivan Pugliesi. 55.
has experienced

233
00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.708
a day of abdominal cramps.
vomiting. and diarrhea.

234
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:49.879
Afebrile. tachy at 124.
BP 192 over 100.

235
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.172
I'm Dr. Mohan.

236
00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:52.924
I'm Student Doctor Whitaker.

237
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.759
Nice to meet you guys.

238
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.555
Um. I would have called my own
doctor. but I'm from New York.

239
00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.181
You two kids ever
been out there?

240
00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.017
Oh. I've never been to New York.

241
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.061
Coming to Pittsburgh was
my first time leaving Nebraska.

242
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.730
[chuckles]

243
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.232
- Uh. h-how long are you in town?
- Just till Monday.

244
00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:11.234
My... my daughter's
getting married.

245
00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.403
She's my baby and the only girl.

246
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:15.363
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. thanks.

247
00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:17.407
Uh. you know. they say
you're not supposed

248
00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.409
to have a favorite kid. but...

249
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.828
I'm an only child.
so I was born the favorite.

250
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:23.371
- [chuckles]
- Whitaker?

251
00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.081
Oh. uh. youngest of four.

252
00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:28.376
I'm just happy when
my parents remember my name.

253
00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:31.087
No. I meant. do you have
any questions for the patient?

254
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.756
Oh. uh...

255
00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.382
Hey. can I just get something
for the pain. you think?

256
00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:36.134
As soon as we're done
with this assessment.

257
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.637
We just want to do
our due diligence.

258
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.389
Any intestinal disease
in your past?

259
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.724
Ulcers. gallstones?

260
00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.101
General stomach ailments?
Surgeries?

261
00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:46.770
No. No. nothing.

262
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.271
Good bowel sounds.

263
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:50.273
Thank you.

264
00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:52.275
Abdomen's soft.

265
00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.443
Nothing focal.

266
00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.944
Anything else bothering you?

267
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:57.322
Uh. you know.
my back is killing me.

268
00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.741
Four-hour car ride will do it.

269
00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.160
I mean. the last time
I tweaked it.

270
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.953
I think they gave me. um...

271
00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:07.541
they gave me morphine. and...
and that worked pretty good.

272
00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:10.460
- Do you smoke?
- No.

273
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.129
- Drink alcohol?
- Uh. once. twice a month.

274
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.798
I'm not a big drinker.

275
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.384
Any recreational drugs.
either pills or by injection?

276
00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.636
Tranquilizers. hallucinogens. painkillers?

277
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.430
Uh. all of the above.

278
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.973
Yeah. I'm kidding.

279
00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:25.934
No. no drugs. never.

280
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.770
And what do you spend
your time doing?

281
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.148
I'm an actuary.
It's risk management. stats.

282
00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:33.858
It's pretty much a desk job.

283
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.318
I pulled Zofran for the nausea.

284
00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:37.279
Start with 4. repeat PRN.

285
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.366
What. and that's it?

286
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.660
For now. we're going to start
with some blood tests.

287
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.787
We'll be back soon
and check in on you.

288
00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.373
All right. Fine.

289
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:52.001
What do you think
we should be looking at?

290
00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:55.171
A big differential of pretty
serious stuff to rule out.

291
00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:57.006
So what's your plan?

292
00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:59.718
Besides Zofran. CBC. CMP.

293
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.178
IV fluids. morphine. maybe CT.

294
00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:04.848
Good on labs and IV fluids.
but no morphine.

295
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.350
Treat his symptoms with
Clonidine and muscle relaxants.

296
00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:09.018
What if he's...
[scoffs]

297
00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:12.814
Look. I-I really can't lose
another patient today.

298
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.442
Remember how I said you get
good at spotting the fakers?

299
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.026
Yeah.

300
00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:19.821
He's exhibiting every sign
of opiate withdrawal.

301
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.531
Eyes dilated. tearing.

302
00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.993
skin has piloerection
and goosebumps.

303
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.536
Hypertension. tachycardia.

304
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.705
Agitation. restlessness. perspiration.

305
00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.457
He's checking every box.

306
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.625
Right. but he said
he doesn't take drugs

307
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:36.171
and seldom drinks alcohol. so...

308
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.173
That's exactly what
he would want you to believe

309
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.049
if he was drug-seeking.

310
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.593
Wow.
You're good.

311
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.887
Thanks.

312
00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.055
I am.

313
00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:47.682
So how do we treat him?

314
00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.726
By getting him to admit
his opiate usage.

315
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.186
Right. How do we do that?

316
00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.520
By being smarter
than the patient.

317
00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:53.521
Got it.

318
00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:54.856
Another big one.

319
00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.192
You said that
the last two times.

320
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.528
Shoulder dystocia.

321
00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:02.030
[moaning]

322
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.198
The head's pulling back.

323
00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.908
That's called the turtle sign.

324
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.576
Hey. Donahue.
can you call an L and D nurse

325
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.745
and ask her to bring down
a fetal monitor. please?

326
00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.079
What's going on?

327
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.414
Baby's shoulder
might be a little

328
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.416
stuck on your pelvic bone.

329
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.084
It's nothing for you
to worry about.

330
00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.712
We'll just try something
different on the next push.

331
00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:19.380
Ready?

332
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.591
Why don't we all take
a deep breath. huh?

333
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.594
Everybody.
[all breathe deeply]

334
00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:27.263
One more time. Dads too.
And in.

335
00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:29.098
[all breathe deeply]

336
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.267
If you want him
for Halloween. just say it.

337
00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:33.728
I want him for Halloween
and everything until then.

338
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:35.271
- Give me Thanksgiving.
- Fine.

339
00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.773
You can celebrate
bringing smallpox

340
00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.316
to wipe out
the Native Americans.

341
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.776
You know.
I'm the one who's hurt.

342
00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.945
A little sympathy
wouldn't kill you.

343
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.072
You broke your ankle

344
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:46.950
doing something stupid
with our son.

345
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.284
I need surgery.

346
00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:50.119
He wasn't wearing
a helmet. Chad.

347
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.121
What if he had fallen
and hit his head?

348
00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:55.917
- He didn't.
- No. but he could have.

349
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:59.128
[whispering] Do you know what
it's like to watch a child die?

350
00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:00.630
Oh. here we go.

351
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.423
You know how many kids
come in here

352
00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:05.176
who are messed up because
of one stupid parental mistake?

353
00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.262
You know I would never let
anything happen to our son.

354
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.013
Then act like it.

355
00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.306
Be a grown-up.

356
00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:12.058
You're his father.
not his friend.

357
00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.310
Yeah. and you're his mother.
not my wife.

358
00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:15.895
- Do you think...
- Chad!

359
00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:18.147
- Oh. my God!
- Hey. babe.

360
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:20.900
[McKay scoffs]

361
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:22.068
Where's Harrison?

362
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:23.444
both: Staff lounge.

363
00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:25.614
- Is he okay?
- both: He's fine.

364
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.745
I-I'm going to go
check on Harrison.

365
00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:34.330
I'm pretty sure being
in the same room

366
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:37.083
with her violates
the restraining order. so...

367
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.126
I'll go.

368
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.836
I can take him home.

369
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:42.130
Uh. actually. Chloe.
since it'll be hard

370
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.340
for me to get around
after my surgery.

371
00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:48.052
um. Harrison is going to stay
with Cassie for a little while.

372
00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.345
- Right.
- No.

373
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.055
I'm here.

374
00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.391
I can help take care of him
while you're recovering.

375
00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.727
- Absolutely not.
- Babe. I don't mind.

376
00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.020
I do.

377
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.688
Um. yeah. sure.
if you don't mind...

378
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.023
just till I'm back on my feet.

379
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:01.316
Wait... hold... hold on! I...

380
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.650
Dr. McKay.
sorry to interrupt!

381
00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.360
We're moving Central 6
to Trauma One.

382
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:05.862
We need you.

383
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.406
We are not done here.

384
00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.869
[indistinct chatter]

385
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.622
ICU boarder.
48-year-old cirrhotic.

386
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:19.000
here for hematemesis.

387
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.711
Intubated overnight and
after one unit pBRCs and FFP

388
00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.213
- was supposedly stable.
- Not anymore. Weak carotid.

389
00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:27.342
Javadi?
I need you on suction.

390
00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.218
W-why is she bleeding
all of a sudden?

391
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.138
Most likely. bleeding is
from the esophageal varices.

392
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:34.515
With cirrhosis. you get
enlarged veins under pressure

393
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:35.975
at the entry of the stomach.

394
00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:38.311
Varicose veins.
and they can burst.

395
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:39.729
What does that mean?

396
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.481
The cirrhosis from hepatitis B

397
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.857
caused a vein to burst

398
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:44.567
where the esophagus
meets the stomach.

399
00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:46.444
and that's where
the blood is coming from.

400
00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.279
In through the nose...

401
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.864
Mel. I'll have you help
with the McRoberts maneuver.

402
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:51.908
- Of course.
- Hey. Natalie...

403
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.077
we're going to lift your knees
up to your chest now.

404
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.912
Doing great.

405
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:59.040
Justin. is this the worst
you've ever seen me?

406
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:00.750
This is the most
I've ever seen of you.

407
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.251
You're beautiful.

408
00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.087
All right. a little
suprapubic pressure here.

409
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:05.588
We got you.

410
00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.799
You're going to feel me
pressing on your bladder.

411
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.467
Two minutes since head delivery.

412
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.094

You're doing great. Nat.

- Give me a big push!

to come down here. please.
from the NICU?

423
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.281
What's... what's happening?

424
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.616
The baby's heart rate
has slowed.

425
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:35.118
which could be
a sign of distress.

426
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:37.036
- So what do we do?
- We deliver this baby.

427
00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:38.705
We got this.

428
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.289
We got this.

430
00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:44.293
Eusebio. can you page the OR

431
00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:46.462
and tell them to prep
for a possible crash C-section?

432
00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:48.506
BP's only 82 over 46.

Oh. fuck! That hurts.

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:20.663
If I can get my hand inside.

445
00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:22.582
under the baby's head.

446
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:26.169
I can release that lower arm.

I'll need the Minnesota box.
Who's in there?

451
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.635
- Dr. McKay.
- Tell her to go ahead

452
00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:36.012
and get set up...
she knows what to do.

453
00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.180
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Yeah.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.806

456
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:41.851
- both: We are.
- Oh.

457
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.936
And who's the mother?
both: We are.

458
00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:45.354
Roger that.

459

OR is prepped and ready.
Do we need to go up?

460
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.485
Uh. not if I can rotate
this posterior shoulder.

461
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:52.695
- All right. there's the elbow.
- Make sure it's flexed.

462
00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:55.323
It... it's flexed.
Good call.

463
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.492
We're getting closer.
Just stay with me. okay?

464
00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:59.035
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

465
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.329
I've got control
of the hand and forearm.

466

Oh. that hurts!

- Perfect.
- You're right there.

470

Good! Hey!

We got a baby boy!

[laughs]

475
00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:23.142
Uh. I've got a stubborn set
of twins upstairs.

476
00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:24.894
Admit her to postpartum.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.188
Congratulations. everyone.

[monitor beeping]

480
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.738
Good job.

481
00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:37.323
He's pretty quiet.

482
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:38.866
Sometimes
it takes them a minute.

483
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:40.910
Put the baby on a pulse ox
and a heart monitor.

484
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:42.578
Hey. Amy. swap out with me.

485
00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:44.747
Mel. dry and stimulate
vigorously.

486
00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:46.082
- On it.
- Very vigorously.

487
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.000
Shouldn't he be crying by now?

488
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:49.752
- Heart rate is 95.
- Too slow.

489
00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:51.254
Dr. Collins. BVM.

490
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.047
[suction hissing]

491
00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:55.800
Tiny volumes. once per second.

492
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.885
- This kid needs oxygen.
- Come on. baby.

493
00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.137
Come on. let's breathe.

494
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.222
- Suction ready?
- Ready. Dr. Ingram?

495
00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:02.640
I'm opening the intubation tray.

496
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.100
- Yep.
- One minute apgar is three.

497
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:06.102
Isn't apgar supposed
to be nine or ten?

498
00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:07.562
- What does that mean?
- Come on. baby.

499
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.939
Breath. baby. breathe.

500
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.816
[baby choking]
There we go!

501
00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.609
- We got him back.
- [baby crying]

502
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.777
That's good. right?

503
00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:16.737
That is very good. very good.

504
00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:18.281
- Okay. you got this?
- Yeah. go.

505
00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.615
Looking much better.

506
00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:21.409
Hemorrhagic shock from varices.

507
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.119
Failed medical therapy.

508
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.121
Suction stopped working.

509
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.789
Because your canister is full.

510
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.291
- I'm on it.
- Oh. my God.

511
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:30.459
- Someone please take her out.
- Mom!

512
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.711
Thank you very much.

513
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.129
By the way. that is not

514
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.047
how you raise
patient-satisfaction scores.

515
00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:36.966
Okay. Dr. McKay. do you want
to explain to Javadi here

516
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:38.634
- all about the Minnesota?
- Yeah.

517
00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:41.137
So best way to stop the
bleeding is direct pressure.

518
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.055
First balloon goes in
the stomach as an anchor.

519
00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:44.640
Second runs the length
of the esophagus

520
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.392
for direct pressure
on the varices.

521
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:48.102
First. we want
to inflate the balloon

522
00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.645
under water
like a bicycle inner tube

523
00:19:49.646 --> 00:19:51.314
- to check for any air leaks.
- Yeah.

524
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.150
- Javadi. stopcock in the ports.
- Use the 50-cc syringe.

525
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:56.986
- Suction's good and running.
- I got it.

526
00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.988
[suction hissing]

527
00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.656
What did you give me?

528
00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:02.658
Because I feel worse.

529
00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:05.995
I told you that I got better
last time with morphine.

530
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.830
I have a morphine-like
drug called BUPE.

531
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:09.957
Works the same way and faster.
goes right under your tongue.

532
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.667
If this doesn't work.
we'll switch to morphine.

533
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:13.169
But let's try this first. okay?

534
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.796
[sighs]
I just want the pain to stop.

535
00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:17.006
Open up.

536
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.507
Lift your tongue.

537
00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:20.635
Leave it there.
and let it dissolve.

538
00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:23.679
We'll be back in ten minutes.

539
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.891
[groans]

540
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.435
Just so I'm clear...

541
00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:31.312
our plan is lying to patients?

542
00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:33.147
I didn't lie.

543
00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:35.274
BUPE is a morphine-like drug.
binds to the same receptor.

544
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.817
He said he isn't an addict.

545
00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:38.819
so why give him
an opiate agonist

546
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.863
to treat
his withdrawal symptoms?

547
00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:43.324
Because I don't believe him.
And I know this will work.

548
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.034
Then once he feels better.

549
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.786
we can get him to admit
to his addiction

550
00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.704
and treat him long-term.

551
00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:50.331
If you say so.

552
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.166
First do no harm.

553
00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.670
Then do what's best
for the patient.

554
00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.549
[sighs] Here you go. hon.

555
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.219
[suction hissing]

556
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.596
[sighs]
Langdon called the main line.

557
00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:07.390
- You got to be kidding me.
- Princess answered.

558
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:09.684
Told him you were busy.
Just wanted you to know.

559
00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:11.727
Okay. noted.
Thank you.

560
00:21:11.728 --> 00:21:13.354
[monitor beeping]

561
00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.773
- Can you see anything?
- I don't have to.

562
00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.733
You just have to push
the tongue out of the way

563
00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:19.902
in order to pass the tube.

564
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:22.530
Okay.
Here we go.

565
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.867
[suction hissing. bubbling]

566
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.746
Heart rate's 124.
BP's still only 84 over 42.

567
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:32.081
Bleeding is still brisk.

568
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:34.041
Get another unit
on that infuser. please.

569
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:37.379
- How far did you go?
- 50 centimeters.

570
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:41.257
Dr. Robby?

571
00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:43.592
Did you say 50 centimeters?
Yes. that's plenty.

572
00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:45.094
Inflate the gastric balloon.

573
00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.096
Start with 50. and then
we'll check the placement

574
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:48.723
in the stomach with an X-ray.

575
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:51.476
[monitor beeping rapidly]

576
00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.187
Apgar is now ten.

577
00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:56.981
[monitor beeping]

578
00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.107
Go on.

579
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.193
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

580
00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.655
Okay. little one.

581
00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:05.948
Okay.

582
00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:08.993
[baby cooing]

583
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.162
All right. support his head
right over here.

584
00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.456
- All right. come here.
- Right there.

585
00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:15.417
There you go.

586
00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:21.130
You're a natural.

587
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:24.468
[sniffles]

588
00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.781
Whenever you're ready.

589
00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:51.077
- We're gonna take him now.
- Okay.

590
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.995
Already miss your dad.

591
00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:54.873
- I'll be up soon.
- Okay.

592
00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:01.045
Can I put my legs down now?

593
00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:03.256
As soon as your placenta's out.

594
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.884
- Oh.
- [groaning in pain]

595
00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:09.470
Breathe.
Good. good.

596
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.347
Here it comes.

597
00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.849
[gurgling]

598
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.851
Oh. wow.

599
00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:17.561
- What?
- That is a lot of blood.

600
00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.522
Starting a second line.
Spike a liter of saline.

601
00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:20.689
- On it.
- What's going on?

602
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.191
This happens sometimes.

603
00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:24.151
We have to help the uterus
clamp back down.

604
00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:27.488
Starting uterine massage.
40 of oxytocin in the back.

605
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.365
800 mikes
of sublingual misoprostol

606
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:30.991
and 1.000 of TXA.

607
00:23:30.992 --> 00:23:32.993
2 units from the blood bank.
just in case.

608
00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.829
Call OB and get Robby!

609
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.540
- Why is Dana still here?
- She refuses to leave.

610
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:39.291
That's perfect placement.

611
00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:43.045
- She wants to finish her shift.
- Of course she does.

612
00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:45.381
I've never met a charge nurse
who wasn't a stubborn bitch.

613
00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:46.632
McKay.

614
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:48.384
In an adorable way. of course.

615
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:50.052
I honestly don't know
what we'd do without her.

616
00:23:50.053 --> 00:23:51.720
The mouth is filling up again.

617
00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:53.013
It's like a fountain.

618
00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.557
Dr. Robby. we need you
in Trauma Two.

619
00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:56.142
Yeah. okay. I'll be right there.

620
00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:57.726
She's still bleeding
higher up in the esophagus.

621
00:23:57.727 --> 00:23:59.562
Natalie.
Keep your eyes open.

622
00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:00.729
We got it.

623
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.064
- Perlah?
- Yeah.

624
00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.899
She's not bleeding
in her stomach.

625
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.401
We have to inflate the second
balloon up in the esophagus.

626
00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:06.902
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Dr. Robby. we need you!

627
00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:08.529
Yes!
Fuck! I'm coming. I'm coming!

628
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.738
Fucking Langdon.

629
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:12.867
This port is in the esophagus.

630
00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:14.410
With a ton of blood.

631
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.745
Mystery solved.

632
00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:20.249
Pump up the esophageal balloon
to 30 millimeters mercury.

633
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.042
That's an insufflator
and a manometer?

634
00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.711
Yep. just like
a fancy bike pump.

635
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:27.923
We are at 30.
and shut the stopcock.

636
00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:30.259
Barely any blood coming
from the esophageal port.

637
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.719
The balloon
stopped the bleeding.

638
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.512
Tomorrow GI
can cauterize the veins.

639
00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:35.890
That was awesome.

640
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:37.725
I learned from the best.

641
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:40.603
[monitor beeping]

642
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.062
Is she going to be okay?

643
00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:43.731
We are doing
everything that we can.

644
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.566
Massive PPH on MTP
and all uterotonics.

645
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:48.444
Any rupture? Any inversion?
Any retained products?

646
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:50.279
Checked for all.
None present.

647
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.448
- This is all my fault.
- Second unit's going up.

648
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:55.201
Still tachy at 130.
Systolic's only 84.

649
00:24:55.202 --> 00:24:58.078
Let's try carboprost.
0.25 milligrams IM.

650
00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:00.080
And get a Bakri balloon
from Central.

651
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.749
You could talk to her.
Get in there.

652
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.459
Tell her some of your favorite
memories with her.

653
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.252
That'll help.
[elevator bell dings]

654
00:25:05.253 --> 00:25:07.129
- [indistinct chatter]
- Thanks for coming down.

655
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.797
You said there was pizza.

656
00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:10.674
Uh. do you remember
that thing I was worried about?

657
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:13.344
My foot is fine. but I'll
let you make it up to me

658
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:14.637
with a cocktail.

659
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.472
- No. about Langdon.
- What about him?

660
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:19.141
Uh. unfortunately. I was
right. and he's been dismissed.

661
00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:21.769
- What do you mean "dismissed"?
- Dr. Robby sent him home.

662
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.646
Why?

663
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.689
You know. it's prob... best if
we don't talk about it anymore.

664
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.483
But if you could just keep a lid

665
00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:29.485
on what I mentioned earlier.
that would be really great.

666
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:31.320
You called me down
to talk about it.

667
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:33.030
but you don't want
to talk about it?

668
00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:35.824
- What is going on?
- He's been stealing meds.

669
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:37.910
Stop. I don't want to talk
about this.

670
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.828
- You just said...
- I said stop.

671
00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:42.414
I don't want any part of this.

672
00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:44.250
[scoffs] You're trouble.

673
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:47.546
[indistinct chatter]

674
00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:51.173
[quietly] Fuck.

675
00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:52.341
[sighs]

676
00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:53.467
Bakri's here.

677
00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:54.760
- Need a fresh saline bag.
- On it.

678
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:56.136
Third and fourth units
are coming up.

679
00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.429
- FFP is also infusing.
- Keep going.

680
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.681
Keep talking to her.
More memories.

681
00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:00.266
- It'll help.
- There was the time

682
00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:01.850
that we got that.
um. glass table

683
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.936
off of Craigslist.
and we went to go pick it up.

684
00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:05.521
and they mugged us.
and they stole it back from us?

685
00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:06.897
Estimated blood loss?

686
00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.065
About two liters. maybe three.

687
00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.191
What's she had?

688
00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:12.695
Oxytocin drip. TXA. carboprost.

689
00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:14.488
massive transfusion protocol.

690
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:18.367
- Spike the saline.
- Balloon is past the cervix.

691
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:20.494
- How much should we put in?
- Up to 500.

692
00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:22.371
If that doesn't work.
she'll need a hysterectomy.

693
00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.707
- "Hysterectomy"?
- This is going to work.

694
00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:26.208
Come on. keep talking.
More memories.

695
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:28.002
It's good for her.
It's good for all of us.

696
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.670
Uh. and the time we binged
"Game of Thrones"

697
00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:33.090
two months before the finale
because of. uh. FOMO?

698
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.384
- [monitor beeping]
- Natalie! Hey. Natalie!

699
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.804
Natalie!
Stay with us!

700
00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:40.723
How are you feeling.
Mr. Pugliesi?

701
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:43.852
Oh. I'm feeling a lot better.
Nausea's gone.

702
00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:48.564
What about your stomachaches?
Muscle cramps?

703
00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:52.860
[exhales sharply]
I mean. I'd say I'm 75% better.

704
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:56.238
Blood pressure and heart rate
are back to normal.

705
00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:57.489
Incredible.

706
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.074
You sound surprised.

707
00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:02.411
Oh. no. I'm just relieved
for you. so...

708
00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:03.912
[scoffs]

709
00:27:03.913 --> 00:27:06.749
Good news is you can have
another dose.

710
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.584
That should get you
back to 100%.

711
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.085
Tongue up.

712
00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:13.130
I think we did it.

713
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:16.133
No more blood loss.

714
00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:17.760
Thanks for your help.

715
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.638
I'll tell OR to stand down.

716
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:23.932
Nice save. Dr. Robinavitch.
Dr. Collins.

717
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:25.476
Pulse ox 99.

718
00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.936
BP 102 over 68.

719
00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:31.106
She doesn't need the mask.

720
00:27:31.107 --> 00:27:35.320
Thank you for being my best
friend in the whole world.

721
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.157
We're family.

722
00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:43.786
How long does this thing
need to stay in me?

723
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:46.705
12 to 24 hours.
We'll take it out tomorrow.

724
00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:48.582
We're going to admit you
to the ICU

725
00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:50.417
- for overnight monitoring.
- Thanks. Dr. Robby.

726
00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:53.546
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you. Dr. Collins.

727
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.300
Excuse me.

728
00:27:58.301 --> 00:28:01.470
- [door opens. closes]
- BP's 98 over 70.

729
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:03.723
Heart rate's 104.

730
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.228
[indistinct chatter]

731
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:12.147
- So w-what happens next?
- [door closes]

732
00:28:12.148 --> 00:28:14.316
Once. uh. she's stabilized.
the GI specialist

733
00:28:14.317 --> 00:28:17.111
can do an endoscopy to try
to cauterize the bleeders.

734
00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.654
Or they might put in a shunt

735
00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:20.823
to take pressure
off the bleeding veins.

736
00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:23.117
And she'll go to the top
of the transplant list

737
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:24.493
for a new liver.

738
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:26.995
"The top of the list"?
It's that serious?

739
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:30.874
It is. yeah. but. um...

740
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.835
once she gets her new liver.

741
00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:35.879
she should be able to return
to normal life.

742
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.464
Okay.

743
00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:39.842
I-I guess I always knew
that this day would come.

744
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:42.594
but... somewhere
in the back of my mind.

745
00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:44.972
I hoped that maybe it wouldn't.

746
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.099
It's a lot for someone
your age to handle.

747
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.351
Is there anybody
we can call or...

748
00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:50.519
Oh. no.

749
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.937
No. it's just us.

750
00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:54.857
It's been that way
for a long time.

751
00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:56.942
I'm sorry.
That's really hard.

752
00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.278
Yeah. it's good she has you.

753
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.363
Yeah. I'm the same age
that she was

754
00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.031
when she first got hep B.

755
00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:05.284
I know it's hard to believe
when you look at her.

756
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.119
but she was a wild child

757
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.789
and an intravenous drug user.

758
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.709
But she got clean
the day that she found out

759
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.045
she was pregnant with me.
and she has been ever since.

760
00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:19.423
She sounds like a good mom.

761
00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.091
She's the best.

762
00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:23.177
Are you close with your mom?

763
00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:25.430
Um. sure. yeah.

764
00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:29.057
- Like. proximity-wise?
- [chuckles]

765
00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:31.268
Um. it's just not the first
word that comes to mind.

766
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.936
It's... it's complicated.

767
00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.063
- Usually is. right?
- Yeah.

768
00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:37.441
I mean. my mom
hasn't been perfect.

769
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.568
I mean. sometimes
I really hated her.

770
00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:43.030
But I always loved her...

771
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:46.408
and I knew that she loved me.

772
00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:49.161
Yeah. it's a long road ahead.

773
00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:52.247
But it's a marathon.
not a sprint.

774
00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:54.583
All you can do is take it
day by day.

775
00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:57.503
We have a great social worker
here. Kiara Alfaro.

776
00:29:57.504 --> 00:29:59.254
if you want to talk to her.

777
00:29:59.255 --> 00:30:00.923
Maybe a-a little bit later.

778
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:05.552
I think I just want to be
with my mom right now.

779
00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:08.096
Yeah.
Of course.

780
00:30:08.097 --> 00:30:10.516
Yeah.

781
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:11.850
I know.

782
00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:14.436
Dude. you got to stop
calling me. okay?

783
00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:16.271
Yeah. okay.

784
00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:18.440
I'll tell him.
I'll...

785
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:20.235
Whenever I see him next.

786
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.072
Okay.

787
00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:27.908
Ah. sh...

788
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.284
Guess who that was.

789
00:30:29.285 --> 00:30:31.286
God.

790
00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:32.913
No. I told you. He never calls.

791
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:35.123
Well. Langdon's desperate
to get ahold of you.

792
00:30:35.124 --> 00:30:36.750
- [phone vibrating]
- You don't say.

793
00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:39.127
God damn it.

794
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:40.838
Hey. Jake.

795
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.673
Hey. man.
How's it going?

796
00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.591
Everything okay with
the passes and the tickets?

797
00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:46.260
<i>Yeah. yeah. it's all good.</i>

798
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.386
Want to say hi?

799
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:49.471
Hey. Jake.
Long time no see.

800
00:30:49.472 --> 00:30:51.265
How's the festival?

801
00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:52.474
<i>It's really cool.</i>

802
00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:54.059
<i>I mean. there's tons of people.</i>

803
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.602
<i>and there's a lot
of cool stuff going on.</i>

804
00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:57.062
Good. I'm glad you're having
a good time.

805
00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:58.772
How's your friend?

806
00:30:58.773 --> 00:31:01.066
<i>Oh. she actually wanted
to thank you personally.</i>

807
00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:02.651
<i>Hi. Dr. Robinavitch!</i>

808
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:04.444
Just Robby.

809
00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:06.613
<i>Robby. I'm Leah. Jake's friend.</i>

810
00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.240
- <i>Girlfriend.</i>
- <i>Stop!</i>

811
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:10.117
<i>You said you weren't
going to embarrass me.</i>

812
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.827
<i>I know you were supposed
to be here with Jake.</i>

813
00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:13.954
<i>so thank you so much for
letting me use your tickets.</i>

814
00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:16.623
- <i>We're having a blast.</i>
- You're more than welcome.

815
00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:18.500
<i>All right. well.
we got to get out of here.</i>

816
00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:20.168
<i>but thanks again
for the tickets. man.</i>

817
00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:22.170
<i>Thank you!
Nice meeting you!</i>

818
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:23.881
You too.

819
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.967
[call chimes]

820
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:36.894
Can I get you anything?

821
00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.062
No.

822
00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:41.899
I didn't even know
that you were trying.

823
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.652
I really didn't tell anyone.

824
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.198
It's not like
it's the first time. but...

825
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.535
It's probably the last.

826
00:31:53.536 --> 00:31:55.622
Why do you say that?

827
00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.586
[sighs]

828
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:07.008
Do you know how much IVF costs?

829
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:11.511
I should have gone into
reproduction endocrinology.

830
00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:13.138
[chuckles]

831
00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:16.976
Oh. those fertility doctors
are making a killing.

832
00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:22.940
Even if my insurance would pay
for more rounds or I could...

833
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.443
pay out of pocket. I...

834
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:31.740
[crying] I'm. uh...

835
00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:35.370
I'm not sure I could go
through this again.

836
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:41.042
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

837
00:32:44.337 --> 00:32:47.548
I've never known you
to give up on anything.

838
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:52.594
Except maybe me.

839
00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:56.848
[chuckling] Unbelievable.

840
00:32:56.849 --> 00:32:59.727
- I had it coming.
- Mm.

841
00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:03.271
Do you want me to go find Kiara?

842
00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:04.731
- Do you want...
- No.

843
00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:07.275
No. look. I know
you mean well. but I just...

844
00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:09.027
I just want to be left alone.

845
00:33:09.028 --> 00:33:10.195
Go home.

846
00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:11.780
You sure?

847
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:13.740
Absolutely.

848
00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:15.909
There's only an hour left
in the shift.

849
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.203
It's not like we're going
to get ahead of it.

850
00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:20.455
We never do.
Maybe we never can.

851
00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:23.291
So. yeah. go home.

852
00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:25.585
Turn off your phone.
Turn off the TV.

853
00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:29.089
Pour a glass of wine.
Have a bath.

854
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.008
Go to bed.

855
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:35.095
And if you need anything...

856
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:37.140
Thank you.

857
00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:46.815
I got...

858
00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:50.944
I got pregnant a few years ago.

859
00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:52.320
Ah.

860
00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:55.157
I wasn't ready to be a mom then.

861
00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:58.493
I wasn't even sure
about the relationship.

862
00:33:58.494 --> 00:34:01.706
I never told him.

863
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.004
I was afraid.

864
00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:13.175
I was afraid of. um...

865
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.136
all of it.

866
00:34:17.346 --> 00:34:19.347
But. mostly...

867
00:34:19.348 --> 00:34:23.311
I was afraid he'd hate me
for being selfish.

868
00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:28.523
{\an8}Not selfish.

869
00:34:28.524 --> 00:34:30.150
{\an8}Heather...

870
00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:31.860
{\an8}not selfish.

871
00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:34.196
{\an8}[cries. breathes shakily]

872
00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:37.992
Do you think
he'd forgive me if he knew?

873
00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:45.082
[inhales deeply] Yes.

874
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:48.502
[exhales deeply]

875
00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:50.087
And. more importantly.

876
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:54.716
I know he would want you
to forgive yourself.

877
00:34:54.717 --> 00:34:58.012
[crying softly]

878
00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:13.318
The mom had nine babies
on her back.

879
00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:14.861
That's a big family.

880
00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:16.321
Opossums are marsupials.

881
00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:18.573
so they have a pouch
like a kangaroo.

882
00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:20.408
- You're smart.
- Thanks.

883
00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:22.035
I read a lot
when I was your age. too.

884
00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:24.412
Hey. Victoria. do you
want to show Harrison

885
00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:26.498
- how an ultrasound works?
- Sure. yeah.

886
00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:28.083
You want to see
inside your guts?

887
00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:30.294
- Always.
- [chuckles] Okay.

888
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:33.797
Bye. Mom.

889
00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.758
See you in a sec.

890
00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.386
[sighs]

891
00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:42.889
This definitely violates
the restraining order.

892
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.391
I tried to warn you.

893
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:46.434
Chad was severely injured.

894
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:49.271
I wish.

895
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:52.941
Look. whatever's going on
between you and Chad.

896
00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:55.569
it's not really
my business. okay?

897
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.446
He's yours.
Believe me.

898
00:35:58.447 --> 00:36:01.449
But mind your place with my son.

899
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.369
Harrison loves living with us.

900
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.788
An 11-year-old needs stability.

901
00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:10.876
I've been Harrison's mother
for 11 years. okay?

902
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:12.627
I made him.

903
00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:15.213
And I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

904
00:36:15.214 --> 00:36:17.925
but I am a damn good mom.

905
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:23.263
Look. Cassie. it's really
about what's best for Harrison.

906
00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:25.557
Chloe. Harrison wants
to live with me.

907
00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:27.225
I don't believe that.

908
00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:29.144
That's because at your age.
your prefrontal cortex

909
00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:30.770
hasn't really even fully formed.

910
00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:32.522
I'll be 25 next month.

911
00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:35.692
Congratulations.
You can rent a car.

912
00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.695
If you really care
what's best for Harrison.

913
00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:41.865
- you will back the fuck off.
- But...

914
00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.492
And if I ever. so help me God.

915
00:36:44.493 --> 00:36:47.455
see you in that shirt again...

916
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:52.334
Let's just say you will have
wished you hadn't. okay?

917
00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:55.337
And he still hasn't admitted
to any opiate use?

918
00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:58.340
No. but. again.
he exhibited every symptom.

919
00:36:58.341 --> 00:36:59.883
- and now he's 100% better.
- [sighs]

920
00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.801
And it feels like it was
just a few hours ago

921
00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:03.845
I was asking you
why didn't you consult me first

922
00:37:03.846 --> 00:37:06.431
and specifically telling you
never to do that again.

923
00:37:06.432 --> 00:37:08.475
But instead. you went
behind my back and...

924
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:09.768
I did it again.

925
00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:11.686
You did it again.
for fuck's sake.

926
00:37:11.687 --> 00:37:13.855
Is anybody honest
about anything anymore?

927
00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:16.149
Or are we all just bullshitting
our way through life?

928
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.151
- It's just a case of...
- That was rhetorical.

929
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:20.028
Why didn't you come and find me?

930
00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:21.529
You were a little busy.

931
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.448
Really?

932
00:37:23.449 --> 00:37:25.992
Do better. Dr. Mohan.

933
00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:27.202
Yes. sir.

934
00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:28.662
Using BUPE was unconventional.

935
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:30.205
and while it wasn't dangerous.

936
00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:32.040
it could be subject
for scrutiny.

937
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:34.668
which I really don't need any
more of right now from Gloria.

938
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:36.753
I expect a level of this
from medical students.

939
00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.173
I expect more from an R3.

940
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.385
And don't forget your vows.
You know what?

941
00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:45.387
Just... just. uh. give 'em
to Cindy. have her hold 'em.

942
00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:47.222
and then you don't
got to think about it.

943
00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:48.932
Because I'm your father.
that's why.

944
00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:51.226
Listen. the doctors are back.
I got to go.

945
00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:53.228
I'll talk to you later.
Yes. I love you.

946
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:54.562
Bye.

947
00:37:54.563 --> 00:37:56.439
How you feeling.
Mr. Pugliesi?

948
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.233
Oh. so much better.
Thank you.

949
00:37:58.234 --> 00:37:59.859
You guys think that I could have

950
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.403
a little bit more
of that medicine.

951
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:03.238
just for the few days
that I'm out here?

952
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:04.864
I just want to be able
to walk my daughter

953
00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:06.408
down the aisle
without shitting myself.

954
00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:08.827
The medication we gave you
wasn't morphine.

955
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:11.746
It was something called
buprenorphine. or BUPE.

956
00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:13.415
Yeah. no. she said that.

957
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:16.001
I mean. whatever you call it.
Doc. it worked great.

958
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:18.545
It's a medicine
specifically targeted

959
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.338
to treat opioid withdrawal.

960
00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:22.507
That's why it worked.

961
00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:26.594
Wait. I-I don't...
I don't understand.

962
00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:29.931
All indicators are that
you have been using opioids.

963
00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:32.058
That would include
pain medication

964
00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.893
like hydrocodone. oxycodone.

965
00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:37.605
I told them I don't do drugs.

966
00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.149
Wow.

967
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.650
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie.

968
00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.819
I said I was giving you
a morphine-like drug

969
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.446
that got rid of your cravings.

970
00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:47.824
Well. you know what?
This is bullshit.

971
00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.452
I mean. you know.
I could sue all of you.

972
00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:51.786
You hear me?

973
00:38:51.787 --> 00:38:53.246
I'm not some junkie
on the street.

974
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:56.416
Look. look. I-I got a family.
I got a job.

975
00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:57.959
I make good money.

976
00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.961
I... you know.
I return my shopping carts.

977
00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:01.296
I pay my taxes.

978
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:02.839
That sound like
a drug addict to you?

979
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.175
Yes. because anybody
can be an addict.

980
00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.551
You are proof of that.

981
00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:08.219
These pills
that you were taking.

982
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.971
they're not helping you
with your pain.

983
00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:12.307
They are keeping you
stuck in it.

984
00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:15.894
A lot of really good people
struggle with addiction.

985
00:39:15.895 --> 00:39:17.312
It is a brain disease.

986
00:39:17.313 --> 00:39:18.980
But social environment
and personal choice

987
00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:20.648
- are also factors.
- I don't have a problem.

988
00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:23.109
The good news is that
the brain is highly dynamic.

989
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.903
as is the environment.

990
00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:27.155
But you need to stop now before
the damage is irreparable.

991
00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:29.157
No. screw this hospital. okay?

992
00:39:29.158 --> 00:39:32.118
- And screw you.
- Hey.

993
00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:35.246
<i>Doctor</i> Mohan...
<i>Doctor</i> Mohan will advise you

994
00:39:35.247 --> 00:39:37.040
on our proposed action plan.

995
00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.875
You can either choose
to follow it or not.

996
00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:42.003
That is entirely up to you.

997
00:39:42.004 --> 00:39:45.508
I wish you luck. Mr. Pugliesi.

998
00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:51.346
We're giving you
a seven-day supply

999
00:39:51.347 --> 00:39:53.223
of a drug called Suboxone.

1000
00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.724
We can set you up
with a medic...

1001
00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.685
Fuck off. I'm not interested.

1002
00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:01.982
My father passed away
when I was young.

1003
00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.527
I don't know if I'll ever
get married. but if I do.

1004
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:08.863
it'll be without him
walking me down the aisle.

1005
00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:11.825
I'm glad your daughter has you
there on her wedding day.

1006
00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.535
I hope she gets
to have you there

1007
00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:16.205
for all of her other big days
to come. too.

1008
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.837
Dr. Mohan.

1009
00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:28.049
I. uh... I don't always know
the exact right thing to say.

1010
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:32.053
but I am sorry about your dad.

1011
00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:35.890
It was a long time ago.
but thank you.

1012
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:37.559
Dr. Robby.

1013
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.769
I've been waiting in the lobby
for almost an hour.

1014
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.229
You said you'd be right there.

1015
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.231
Theresa. oh. I am so sorry.

1016
00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:45.233
Uh. we are
a little understaffed.

1017
00:40:45.234 --> 00:40:46.901
And. truthfully.
my head has been

1018
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:48.903
in a million different places...
can you forgive me?

1019
00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:51.573
I'm here now.
Please. What's going on?

1020
00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:55.452
The psychologist spoke to me
about becoming a petitioner

1021
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.746
to place David on
a involuntary psychiatric hold.

1022
00:40:58.747 --> 00:41:02.083
- Yes.
- But can that be anonymous?

1023
00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:03.585
No.

1024
00:41:03.586 --> 00:41:05.420
To call a 302
in the state of Pennsylvania.

1025
00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:07.589
the petitioner needs to admit
to having witnessed

1026
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.090
the concerning behavior.

1027
00:41:09.091 --> 00:41:11.050
and you need a physician

1028
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:13.094
and a social worker to sign off.

1029
00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:15.722
which both Kiara and I can do.

1030
00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:17.849
What if I'm wrong?

1031
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.392
Then you apologize.

1032
00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:21.019
And we will help you explain

1033
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.354
that this came
from concern for his safety.

1034
00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:25.273
What if you're right?

1035
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:29.861
But if I become a petitioner.
what am I doing to my son?

1036
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:31.696
You...

1037
00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:35.783
are trying to get him the help
that it sounds like he needs.

1038
00:41:35.784 --> 00:41:38.453
David lost his father.
That would affect anyone.

1039
00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.246
But we are failing young men.

1040
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:42.749
because we don't teach them
how to express their emotions.

1041
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.626
We just tell them to man up.
and then we let them

1042
00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:46.669
get their lessons in manhood
from toxic podcasts.

1043
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.254
And these young men

1044
00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:50.256
then feel isolated
from themselves and society.

1045
00:41:50.257 --> 00:41:52.800
and they find community
and comfort

1046
00:41:52.801 --> 00:41:54.802
in all the wrong places.

1047
00:41:54.803 --> 00:41:56.513
David needs help.

1048
00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.557
We don't want to fail him. too.

1049
00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:02.810
You have kids?

1050
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:06.105
I sort of have a stepson. yeah.

1051
00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:07.774
His mom and I dated for a while.

1052
00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:11.361
But. um. Jake and I have
a great relationship.

1053
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:12.779
Jake's lucky.

1054
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.282
Oh. I think
I'm the lucky one there.

1055
00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:19.452
I'm going to check in
with the psychologist...

1056
00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:21.496
and tell her I want to become
a petitioner.

1057
00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:23.748
Great. and then come find me.

1058
00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:26.125
and I will sign off
on that paperwork.

1059
00:42:26.126 --> 00:42:28.670
[telephone rings.
indistinct chatter]

1060
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:30.088
[sighs]

1061
00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:32.465
- Knock. knock.
- [chuckles]

1062
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:34.801
To what do I owe this pleasure?

1063
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.844
I found these.

1064
00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:38.846
You must have dropped them.
Got to be more careful.

1065
00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:41.015
You don't want these ending up
in the wrong hands.

1066
00:42:41.016 --> 00:42:42.935
Ah. you can keep 'em.

1067
00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:47.021
You ever think about quitting?

1068
00:42:47.022 --> 00:42:49.190
[chuckles]

1069
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:50.858
I'm not a quitter.

1070
00:42:50.859 --> 00:42:53.653
Oh. I know
you're a happy drunk today.

1071
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:56.072
But one day.
when your liver fails...

1072
00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:58.074
and believe me. it will fail...

1073
00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.993
you won't be so happy.

1074
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:02.203
It's not a nice way to go.

1075
00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:05.039
I'm digging my own grave.

1076
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.708
Let me.

1077
00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:09.253
[softly] I don't have
to give you the shovel.

1078
00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:15.134
- [indistinct chatter]
- [sighs]

1079
00:43:20.222 --> 00:43:23.391
Um. have you seen
Dr. Langdon?

1080
00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:26.312
Uh. he left for the day.

1081
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.564
He didn't say goodbye.
That's...

1082
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:32.734
Um. I really wanted to tell him
about this delivery.

1083
00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:34.068
It was really cool.

1084
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:38.072
I mean. the dads
were so happy. and. um...

1085
00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:39.574
Great stuff.

1086
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:42.577
Dr. Robby?
I...

1087
00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:44.871
I just wanted to apologize
for what happened with Langdon.

1088
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:46.581
Apology accepted.

1089
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:48.416
I just... if I hadn't said
anything. he would still be...

1090
00:43:48.417 --> 00:43:50.793
Nobody's fault but Langdon's.
Now. if you'll excuse me...

1091
00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.629
Well. it doesn't feel that way.

1092
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:57.091
Some people might have turned
a blind eye. but you didn't.

1093
00:43:57.092 --> 00:44:00.094
It took a strong moral compass
to do what you did...

1094
00:44:00.095 --> 00:44:02.096
on your first day. nonetheless.

1095
00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:03.598
I just wonder if...

1096
00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:06.393
You did the right thing.
Dr. Santos.

1097
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.146
Thanks. Dr. Robinavitch.

1098
00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.773
Have you seen Dana?

1099
00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:14.526
Yeah. she was headed
to the ambulance bay.

1100
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:19.072
<i>Keep your distance.
I'm already in a bad mood.</i>

1101
00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:21.616
- I'm just getting some air.
- [scoffs] Yeah. right.

1102
00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.534
You're a terrible liar.

1103
00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:25.620
Hope you're better at security.

1104
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:28.206
Hey. now you're just being mean.

1105
00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:30.291
You realize that
this is the second person

1106
00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:31.751
to accuse you of that today.

1107
00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:33.920
- You starting to see a pattern?
- No.

1108
00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:35.797
But I am starting
to see why Gloria's unhappy

1109
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.548
with your
patient-satisfaction scores.

1110
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:39.717
- [laughs]
- You need something?

1111
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:41.636
Or you just here to ruin
one of the few things

1112
00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:43.471
that still brings me
a little joy in life?

1113
00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:45.598
I sent Collins home.

1114
00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:48.810
You don't want to work
with anybody today.

1115
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:50.645
You must be in a mood.

1116
00:44:50.646 --> 00:44:54.148
- She's had a rough day.
- [scoffs. chuckles]

1117
00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:56.150
It's going around.

1118
00:44:56.151 --> 00:44:57.944
You should leave. too.

1119
00:44:57.945 --> 00:44:59.862
[chuckling] Yeah.

1120
00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.614
You're good.

1121
00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:03.617
You're not that good.

1122
00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:07.662
You know I was born
at this hospital?

1123
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:11.290
I even volunteered here
in high school.

1124
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:14.168
I've been punched.
kicked. spit at.

1125
00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:16.170
pissed on.
had feces thrown at me.

1126
00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:17.213
I talked to Gloria.

1127
00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.673
I told her. listen.

1128
00:45:18.674 --> 00:45:20.675
we got to do something
to beef up security.

1129
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:23.344
- This can't happen again.
- It will.

1130
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:24.846
It will.

1131
00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.848
Maybe not to me.
but to somebody.

1132
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.808
World's changed.
People are angry.

1133
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:30.309
Our tempers are shorter.

1134
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.438
And we're still just
trying to help.

1135
00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:35.356
You do help.

1136
00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:37.483
You do make a difference.

1137
00:45:37.484 --> 00:45:40.446
One asshole doesn't get
to change that.

1138
00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.243
I think I'm done.

1139
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.496
[sighs]

1140
00:45:50.497 --> 00:45:52.665
Yeah.

1141
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:54.585
I know that one.

1142
00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.422
And I don't blame you.

1143
00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:02.175
I. uh...

1144
00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:04.218
[sighs] I-I-I-I don't know.

1145
00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:06.763
I don't know. Maybe what I want
and what the patients need

1146
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.681
isn't what's best
for you anymore.

1147
00:46:08.682 --> 00:46:10.892
Yeah.

1148
00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:12.560
I just honestly don't know

1149
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:15.062
what I'm going to do
without you.

1150
00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:17.607
You'll figure it out.

1151
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:20.735
You always do.

1152
00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:23.237
You're a good man. Robinavitch.

1153
00:46:23.238 --> 00:46:26.240
Don't let this place
take that from you.

1154
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:27.575
[distant siren wailing]

1155
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:28.993
Okay?

1156
00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:31.037
[cell phone ringing.
cell phone chiming]

1157
00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:33.581
God.
[phone beeps]

1158
00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:35.875
Yeah?

1159
00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:37.418
Code triage.

1160
00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:39.253
[sirens approaching]

1161
00:46:39.254 --> 00:46:40.922
Multiple GSWs.

1162
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:43.634
There's an active shooter
at Pittfest.

1163
00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:49.096
Jake and his girlfriend
are there.

1164
00:46:49.097 --> 00:46:52.309
[sirens approaching]

1164
00:46:53.305 --> 00:47:53.266
Do you want subtitles for any video?
