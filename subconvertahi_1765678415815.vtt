00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.500
<font color="#ff0000">I sense you. brother.</font>

3
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.200
<font color="#ff0000">Hiding...</font>

4
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.570
<font color="#ff0000">...Behind your cloak.</font>

5
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640
<font color="#ff0000">It is time to earn yours.</font>

6
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.000
<font color="#ff0000">Still too small to take me head on.</font>

7
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860
<font color="#ff0000">Use the cave!</font>

8
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.930
<font color="#ff0000">You fight with rage.</font>

9
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.710
<font color="#ff0000">I fight like father.</font>

10
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.710
<font color="#ff0000">You are not father. you are Dek!</font>

11
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.650
<font color="#ff0000">Do you yield?</font>

12
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.990
<font color="#ff0000">Never!</font>

13
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.910
<font color="#ff0000">Good.</font>

14
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.550
<font color="#ff0000">I'm still alive. brother.</font>

15
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.840
<font color="#ff0000">Still much to prove...</font>

16
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.430
<font color="#ff0000">...to show who you are.</font>

17
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.370
<font color="#ff0000">I am Yautja.</font>

18
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.180
<font color="#ff0000">Not yet.</font>

19
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.690
<font color="#ff0000">Are you holding your sword. Kwei?</font>

20
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.660
<font color="#ff0000">No.</font>

21
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.740
<font color="#ff0000">Pick it up!</font>

22
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.010
<font color="#ff0000">You kept this toy?!</font>

23
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.990
<font color="#ff0000">You remember what happened...</font>

24
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.200
<font color="#ff0000">I lost my fang!</font>

25
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.670
<font color="#ff0000">And you saved my life.</font>

26
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.810
<font color="#ff0000">You protected me.</font>

27
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.870
<font color="#ff0000">Come here.</font>

28
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.100
<font color="#ff0000">Fixed it for you.</font>

29
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.390
<font color="#ff0000">Don't blow yourself up.</font>

30
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.020
<font color="#ff0000">Today you make a vow...</font>

31
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.910
<font color="#ff0000">...as our ancestors did before you.</font>

32
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.440
<font color="#ff0000">To earn your place in the clan...</font>

33
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.940
<font color="#ff0000">...you must choose your prey.</font>

34
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.870
<font color="#ff0000">Bring it home...</font>

35
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.740
<font color="#ff0000">...or never return.</font>

36
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.230
<font color="#ff0000">Wait — Go back!</font>

37
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.980
<font color="#ff0000">Genna.</font>

38
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.920
<font color="#ff0000">The death planet.</font>

39
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.350
<font color="#ff0000">Home of the un-killable Kalisk.</font>

40
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.490
<font color="#ff0000">Even father fears it.</font>

41
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.830
<font color="#ff0000">Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.</font>

42
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.290
<font color="#ff0000">Father calls me the weakest...</font>

43
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.390
<font color="#ff0000">...so I must kill the strongest.</font>

44
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.110
<font color="#ff0000">Failure means death.</font>

45
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.920
<font color="#ff0000">Then I will not fail.</font>

46
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.030
<font color="#ff0000">I cannot allow it.</font>

47
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.150
<font color="#ff0000">I make my vow.</font>

48
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.790
<font color="#ff0000">I make my vow!</font>

49
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.340
<font color="#ff0000">Father.</font>

50
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.150
<font color="#ff0000">I welcome you with honor.</font>

51
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.770
<font color="#ff0000">Why is it not done?</font>

52
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.090
<font color="#ff0000">He deserves a hunt.</font>

53
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.400
<font color="#ff0000">He is our clan's weakness....</font>

54
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.860
<font color="#ff0000">...weaknesses must be culled.</font>

55
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.720
<font color="#ff0000">He will bring home the Kalisk.</font>

56
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.350
<font color="#ff0000">Foolishness.</font>

57
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.350
<font color="#ff0000">He is a runt.</font>

58
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.750
<font color="#ff0000">You should have done it as he slept.</font>

59
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.610
<font color="#ff0000">Kill him!</font>

60
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.670
<font color="#ff0000">Now!</font>

61
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.130
<font color="#ff0000">He will only honor us in death.</font>

62
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.620
<font color="#ff0000">Father.</font>

63
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.540
<font color="#ff0000">Kwei?</font>

64
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.900
<font color="#ff0000">Be brave. brother.</font>

65
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.010
<font color="#ff0000">Father!</font>

66
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.550
<font color="#ff0000">Kwei!!!</font>

67
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.880
<font color="#ff0000">To forgive weakness...</font>

68
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.520
<font color="#ff0000">...is to show weakness.</font>

69
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.720
<font color="#ff0000">No! Father. no!</font>

70
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.520
<font color="#ff0000">Get your sword!</font>

71
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.170
<font color="#ff0000">Kwei!!!</font>

72
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.330
<font color="#ff0000">Launch sequence initiated.</font>

73
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.680
<font color="#ff0000">Bring it home.</font>

74
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.220
<font color="#ff0000">Bring it home.</font>

75
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.840
<font color="#ff0000">For Kwei.</font>

76
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.470
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja!</font>

77
00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:07.417
Is this better?

78
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.101
Universal translation.

79
00:22:10.671 --> 00:22:12.941
You hear Yautja. others hear their
language.

80
00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:15.541
Oh boy.

81
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:19.041
This isn't great for you.

82
00:22:43.363 --> 00:22:45.583
Then eat you while you can't move.

83
00:22:53.403 --> 00:22:54.763
I could help you. but...

84
00:22:56.703 --> 00:22:57.703
I need a hand.

85
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.390
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja hunt alone.</font>

86
00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:08.969
Yautja might hunt alone. but...

87
00:23:09.704 --> 00:23:10.884
may die alone too.

88
00:23:14.304 --> 00:23:15.304
Kalisk.

89
00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:20.365
You're hunting the Kalisk.

90
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:30.581
Excuse you. sir.

91
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.640
<font color="#ff0000">What happened to your legs?</font>

92
00:25:34.182 --> 00:25:35.302
I'm synthetic.

93
00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:38.962
I was built and deployed by the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation for research.

94
00:25:39.222 --> 00:25:41.842
Because their humans wouldn't last a day
on this planet.

95
00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.182
We found that...

96
00:25:49.812 --> 00:25:50.812
Look.

97
00:25:52.362 --> 00:25:54.773
Many Yautja have come for the Great
Kalisk.

98
00:25:55.693 --> 00:25:57.613
And none have survived it.

99
00:25:57.713 --> 00:25:58.713
Or Genna.

100
00:26:02.593 --> 00:26:03.593
I've seen the Kalisk.

101
00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:06.013
I survived it.

102
00:26:07.413 --> 00:26:08.413
Here's my proposal.

103
00:26:09.103 --> 00:26:12.414
You take me along with you. and I'll guide
you to its den.

104
00:26:13.214 --> 00:26:18.994
Once there. I get my legs. you get your
trophy. and everyone's a winner.

105
00:26:19.594 --> 00:26:20.594
Deal?

106
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.140
<font color="#ff0000">You have you seen the Kalisk?</font>

107
00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:27.067
Oh. yeah.

108
00:26:28.884 --> 00:26:29.884
I've seen the Kalisk.

109
00:26:46.085 --> 00:26:48.385
Good luck with your journey.

110
00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.066
I'm just gonna...

111
00:26:52.316 --> 00:26:53.316
go on my journey.

112
00:26:56.176 --> 00:26:57.656
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

113
00:27:04.576 --> 00:27:05.576
Hey!

114
00:27:09.057 --> 00:27:11.310
I've already shown you that I can be
useful to you.

115
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.460
<font color="#ff0000">Useful...</font>

116
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.250
<font color="#ff0000">...like tool?</font>

117
00:27:17.697 --> 00:27:18.697
Yes.

118
00:27:19.097 --> 00:27:20.617
Yes. Exactly.

119
00:27:20.737 --> 00:27:21.737
Like a tool.

120
00:27:22.327 --> 00:27:24.497
The only way to survive Genna is to work
with it.

121
00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:25.833
And I know how.

122
00:27:26.607 --> 00:27:29.098
And with the right tool...

123
00:27:31.248 --> 00:27:32.298
You could get the Kalisk.

124
00:27:33.398 --> 00:27:34.658
You could be the first.

125
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.580
<font color="#ff0000">I will use you. tool.</font>

126
00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:41.781
You may call me thief.

127
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.629
And what does the chewing?

128
00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:52.449
Your outside veins. or your inner veins?

129
00:27:52.469 --> 00:27:53.469
Inside teeth.

130
00:27:55.769 --> 00:27:57.449
Oh. what should I call you?

131
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:59.149
Hm?

132
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.520
How fast were you going when your ship
crashed?

133
00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:12.300
Faster than sublight speed?

134
00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:14.055
We haven't cracked that yet.

135
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.140
Also. that plasma sword is interesting.

136
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.750
Is it unique to your clan?

137
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.460
And what may I call you?

138
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.580
I call these Imbre Anguis.

139
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:36.371
We just got a snack.

140
00:28:43.961 --> 00:28:46.962
You catch more flies with honey than you
do with vinegar.

141
00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:50.102
Drink my wine.
<font color="#ff0000">Don't want flies.</font>

142
00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:54.322
Predatory organisms are my specific area
of expertise.

143
00:28:55.252 --> 00:28:56.532
I've studied Yautja extensively.

144
00:28:57.652 --> 00:28:58.732
It's an impressive culture.

145
00:28:59.342 --> 00:29:00.762
Here. ask me anything.

146
00:29:00.992 --> 00:29:01.992
I bet I have the answer.

147
00:29:05.103 --> 00:29:06.103
Very funny.

148
00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:08.403
And you still haven't told me your name.

149
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.340
<font color="#ff0000">Name is Dek.</font>

150
00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:35.294
Okay. sure.
<font color="#ff0000">Now talk that way.</font>

151
00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:40.674
Well. let's back up and start at the
beginning.

152
00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:01.446
It's so beautiful.

153
00:30:03.126 --> 00:30:07.146
After all the time I've been stuck here.
I'm tired of the view.

154
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.430
<font color="#ff0000">How long have you been here?</font>

155
00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.166
When?

156
00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:14.686
Well. we arrived on Genna two years ago.
and we built a base.

157
00:30:15.256 --> 00:30:21.307
Then I was in the vulture's nest for the
most exciting 13 days. 7 hours.

158
00:30:21.797 --> 00:30:24.487
43 minutes. and 2 seconds of my life.

159
00:30:26.387 --> 00:30:27.867
But I always knew someone would come.

160
00:30:30.687 --> 00:30:31.767
I was just wrong about who.

161
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.650
<font color="#ff0000">Who would come?</font>

162
00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:39.078
Tessa.

163
00:30:41.283 --> 00:30:43.818
Our crew is made up entirely of synths.

164
00:30:44.893 --> 00:30:46.198
But Tessa and I are special.

165
00:30:47.298 --> 00:30:49.198
We have a higher sensitivity than the
others.

166
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.650
<font color="#ff0000">Sensitivity is weakness.</font>

167
00:30:55.748 --> 00:30:58.939
The sensitivity is what allows us to
understand the creatures on this planet.

168
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:05.159
We were created to work in tandem.

169
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:07.839
Me cooped up in the lab.

170
00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:09.709
Tessa out in the field.

171
00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:13.159
Until the wonderful day Tessa let me come
with her.

172
00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:15.239
We were exploring Genna.

173
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.840
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

174
00:31:22.055 --> 00:31:23.055
Separated me...

175
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.910
and us.

176
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.780
The last sound I remember
hearing... was Tessa...

177
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.730
calling out my name.

178
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.131
Reaching for me.

179
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:39.681
Then the Kalisk.

180
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:42.651
I didn't know what to do.

181
00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:56.432
But I refuse to believe she's dead.

182
00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:35.764
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...

183
00:32:36.024 --> 00:32:40.225
Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia... Thia... Thia... Tessa!

184
00:32:41.944 --> 00:32:46.264
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia...

185
00:33:20.946 --> 00:33:27.496
Hello. Tessa.

186
00:33:28.396 --> 00:33:29.896
The company is not pleased.

187
00:33:32.817 --> 00:33:35.417
Continued failure will result in your
decommission.

188
00:33:39.757 --> 00:33:40.757
Where's Thia?

189
00:33:44.137 --> 00:33:45.857
The beauty has been.

190
00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.710
<font color="#ff0000">I must eat.</font>

191
00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:01.918
Two warriors... Dekin Thia.

192
00:34:02.138 --> 00:34:03.138
On the hunt.

193
00:34:05.038 --> 00:34:06.258
Quick question.

194
00:34:06.418 --> 00:34:08.139
What should I be doing?

195
00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.119
Don't worry. my son.
<font color="#ff0000">What is this creature?</font>

196
00:34:16.019 --> 00:34:18.619
Bone bison... they're Kalisk food.

197
00:34:20.509 --> 00:34:24.819
This is so exciting.
<font color="#ff0000">Then it will be my food. too.</font>

198
00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.380
Hunting with the Yautja?

199
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.940
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

200
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320
Just a warning.

201
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.670
<font color="#ff0000">Quiet tool!</font>

202
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
Razor grass.

203
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.460
It'll cut you the ribbons.

204
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720
We'll just go around.

205
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.260
<font color="#ff0000">You give up too easily.</font>

206
00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.001
We might not be alone in this hunt.

207
00:35:06.882 --> 00:35:08.062
What an odd critter.

208
00:35:08.872 --> 00:35:09.952
I've never seen you before.

209
00:35:16.002 --> 00:35:17.002
Thia.

210
00:35:17.037 --> 00:35:18.037
Nice to meet you.

211
00:35:32.503 --> 00:35:34.323
Looks like your competition is better.

212
00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:37.923
Careful

213
00:35:52.844 --> 00:35:53.844
up in these trees.

214
00:35:54.124 --> 00:35:55.164
There are lunabugs.

215
00:36:09.725 --> 00:36:17.475
Coming up behind you.

216
00:36:31.586 --> 00:36:32.586
Stronger than it looks.

217
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.530
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk?</font>

218
00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:34.952
Not a Kalisk.

219
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.070
<font color="#ff0000">You give up too easily.</font>

220
00:40:40.759 --> 00:40:42.599
That was the best hunt I've ever been on.

221
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:44.359
This is the dream team right here.

222
00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:45.619
The Dynamic Three.

223
00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:46.799
The Dynamic Trio.

224
00:40:47.114 --> 00:40:48.119
The Dynamic Trio!

225
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.420
Trio!

226
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:50.861
Remember when we went down the tree?

227
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.400
That monster's mouth?
I mean... Uggh.

228
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.980
Didn't smell great. didn't smell great.
but...

229
00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.780
...we got him.

230
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.180
We got him.

231
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.200
And then we met you. our little sweet
little little thing...

232
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.920
Thank you. Seriously.

233
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.140
For that experience.

234
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360
Truly amazing.

235
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.881
Thrilling.
Truly thrilling.

236
00:41:09.001 --> 00:41:10.121
What was your favorite part?

237
00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:18.581
What was the smallest me appetizer you've
ever eaten?
<font color="#ff0000">When I pierced its head with my sword</font>

238
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.220
<font color="#ff0000">and its blood rushed down my face.</font>

239
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.540
<font color="#ff0000">This flesh is not sweet.</font>

240
00:41:49.708 --> 00:41:55.873
A little pause...

241
00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:02.743
and we are back.

242
00:42:02.763 --> 00:42:04.964
I think she's marking you.

243
00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:07.834
She wants you to be a part of her clan.

244
00:42:10.344 --> 00:42:11.344
Maybe she's lost.
<font color="#ff0000">I have no clan!</font>

245
00:42:13.744 --> 00:42:14.744
What do you mean?

246
00:42:15.884 --> 00:42:17.164
Don't all Yautja have family?

247
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.270
<font color="#ff0000">No clan.</font>

248
00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:23.444
So you never had anyone looking out for
you?

249
00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.920
<font color="#ff0000">I had a brother.</font>

250
00:42:33.775 --> 00:42:34.775
What happened to him?

251
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.330
<font color="#ff0000">Father killed him.</font>

252
00:42:43.386 --> 00:42:44.386
You're grieving.

253
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.640
<font color="#ff0000">Grief is weakness.</font>

254
00:42:52.426 --> 00:42:54.226
You're here because you lost your brother.

255
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.270
<font color="#ff0000">I am here for Kalisk.</font>

256
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.660
<font color="#ff0000">Why are you here?</font>

257
00:43:07.827 --> 00:43:11.157
I'm here because traveling with you is the
best way to get back to Tessa.

258
00:43:13.897 --> 00:43:18.078
When I was in that vulture's nest. I
was so afraid I would never see her again.

259
00:43:18.677 --> 00:43:20.717
So then you swiped for all I could.
<font color="#ff0000">You should be able to survive on your own.</font>

260
00:43:23.248 --> 00:43:24.558
I can survive on my own.

261
00:43:26.968 --> 00:43:28.648
But who would want to survive on their
own?

262
00:43:34.188 --> 00:43:36.408
Delay us all horror. Tessa.
<font color="#ff0000">Tessa is your sister.</font>

263
00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:42.129
Sister.

264
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:43.829
Huh.

265
00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:46.119
Yeah.

266
00:43:47.459 --> 00:43:48.459
I guess she is.

267
00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:53.179
I have... a sister.

268
00:43:56.974 --> 00:43:57.974
What a lovely thought.

269
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.010
I need to find her.

270
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.750
I need to find her.
<font color="#ff0000">And legs.</font>

271
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.859
Excuse me?

272
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.090
<font color="#ff0000">Finding your sister</font>

273
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.590
<font color="#ff0000">And legs.</font>

274
00:44:19.602 --> 00:44:20.602
Was that a joke?

275
00:47:36.211 --> 00:47:37.211
Fish wonder now.
<font color="#ff0000">The sun rises.</font>

276
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:38.681
Where is Kiwi?
<font color="#ff0000">Let's go.</font>

277
00:47:39.541 --> 00:47:40.541
We can't leave Bud.

278
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:42.861
- Bunt?
- Yeah.

279
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:44.181
Bud.

280
00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:45.361
I named her.

281
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:48.482
Tessa Yautja I need to find her.
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja hunt alone.</font>

282
00:47:50.262 --> 00:47:51.262
You're not alone.

283
00:47:51.522 --> 00:47:52.522
I'm with you.

284
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.490
<font color="#ff0000">You're a tool.</font>

285
00:48:02.117 --> 00:48:03.802
The tree would have eaten us without her.

286
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:10.010
<font color="#ff0000">We're not in the tree now.</font>

287
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.230
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk?</font>

288
00:49:12.926 --> 00:49:13.926
You're not alone.
<font color="#ff0000">It drinks here.</font>

289
00:49:17.106 --> 00:49:18.326
You're not alone.
<font color="#ff0000">It drinks here?</font>

290
00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:23.527
You're not alone.
<font color="#ff0000">You are a useless tool if you don't speak.</font>

291
00:49:31.707 --> 00:49:32.707
Bud saved us.

292
00:49:34.767 --> 00:49:37.077
She spit on you to claim you as part of
her family.

293
00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:45.498
Why'd your father kill your brother?

294
00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.620
<font color="#ff0000">My brother was protecting me.</font>

295
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:03.480
<font color="#ff0000">The clan can have no weakness.</font>

296
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.780
<font color="#ff0000">I will show them strength.</font>

297
00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:15.139
On Earth...

298
00:50:17.149 --> 00:50:18.629
there's a predator known as the wolf.

299
00:50:19.514 --> 00:50:20.515
It's a powerful creature.

300
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.060
They hunt in packs.

301
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.100
They're very loyal.

302
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:32.590
The leader of the pack is the Alpha.
known as the most dominant.

303
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.110
<font color="#ff0000">Wolf</font>

304
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.190
<font color="#ff0000">This alpha must be a great killer.</font>

305
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.730
<font color="#ff0000">I will hunt it too.</font>

306
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.371
No.

307
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:45.731
The Alpha isn't the wolf who kills the
most.

308
00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:51.851
The Alpha is actually the one who best
protects the pack.

309
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.750
<font color="#ff0000">I see...</font>

310
00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:02.550
<font color="#ff0000">But I will be the alpha that kills the most.</font>

311
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.920
<font color="#ff0000">The Kalish's den?</font>

312
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:09.150
<font color="#ff0000">Who are they?</font>

313
00:52:14.805 --> 00:52:19.537
The Kalisk destroyed
most of our mission team.

314
00:52:23.107 --> 00:52:24.226
There am I.

315
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.520
<font color="#ff0000">Easier to walk now.</font>

316
00:53:10.024 --> 00:53:11.238
It's about to be.

317
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.030
<font color="#ff0000">No.</font>

318
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.750
<font color="#ff0000">Easier for me to walk now.</font>

319
00:53:15.639 --> 00:53:19.699
Oh. of course.

320
00:53:20.159 --> 00:53:21.159
Right.

321
00:53:23.679 --> 00:53:24.779
Thank you. Dek.

322
00:53:28.209 --> 00:53:29.449
I'm never going to forget this.

323
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.180
<font color="#ff0000">I too will remember this...</font>

324
00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:39.130
<font color="#ff0000">...today I become Dek of the Yautja.</font>

325
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.220
<font color="#ff0000">I will honor Kwei...</font>

326
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:47.170
<font color="#ff0000">When I bring the Kalisk home.</font>

327
00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.330
<font color="#ff0000">Then I take revenge.</font>

328
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:57.910
<font color="#ff0000">You will be the first to see my trophy.</font>

329
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.560
<font color="#ff0000">It is a great honor.</font>

330
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.960
<font color="#ff0000">For you.</font>

331
00:54:06.231 --> 00:54:07.911
Dek. there's something I have to tell
you.

332
00:54:09.512 --> 00:54:10.512
You need to leave now.

333
00:54:12.662 --> 00:54:13.702
Location beacon activated.

334
00:54:14.302 --> 00:54:15.302
Go on.
<font color="#ff0000">What?</font>

335
00:54:16.372 --> 00:54:17.002
I called Tessa.

336
00:54:17.337 --> 00:54:18.422
The company is on its way.

337
00:54:18.882 --> 00:54:20.282
You can't be here when they arrive.

338
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.940
<font color="#ff0000">I came here for the Kalisk.</font>

339
00:54:26.102 --> 00:54:27.102
So did I. Dek.

340
00:54:28.418 --> 00:54:30.883
The company sent us here to capture the
Kalisk.

341
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.520
<font color="#ff0000">You want my trophy.</font>

342
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:39.290
<font color="#ff0000">Where is the Kalisk?</font>

343
00:54:42.778 --> 00:54:43.778
Dek. you can't kill it.

344
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:47.940
<font color="#ff0000">I use you. tool. You do not use me!</font>

345
00:54:47.824 --> 00:54:48.824
I'm sorry.

346
00:54:49.294 --> 00:54:50.294
You have to leave.

347
00:54:51.474 --> 00:54:53.804
I needed you to help bring me here.

348
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.240
<font color="#ff0000">I use you!</font>

349
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:00.490
<font color="#ff0000">Where is the Kalisk?</font>

350
00:55:00.374 --> 00:55:01.964
I'm trying to help you. Dek.

351
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:07.956
Do you think your brother saved your life
just so you could die here?

352
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:13.850
<font color="#ff0000">Then my death will be honorable.</font>

353
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.650
<font color="#ff0000">Call your sister.</font>

354
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.690
<font color="#ff0000">None can stop me.</font>

355
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:52.390
<font color="#ff0000">Save yourself. tool!</font>

356
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:50.660
<font color="#ff0000">Tool. get these off!</font>

357
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.500
<font color="#ff0000">You are not Thia.</font>

358
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:14.990
<font color="#ff0000">Release me!</font>

359
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.760
<font color="#ff0000">You are another broken tool!</font>

360
01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:23.404
The Yautja call they're weak.

361
01:01:24.174 --> 01:01:25.564
Why were you spared?

362
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.790
<font color="#ff0000">Remove these!</font>

363
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:43.540
<font color="#ff0000">Or I'll rip out your spine and crush your skull!</font>

364
01:01:44.295 --> 01:01:46.405
I read Thia's logs.

365
01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:51.166
You never told her why your brother
protected you.

366
01:01:53.896 --> 01:01:57.726
You mock her war. war seer.
<font color="#ff0000">You are nothing. A device.</font>

367
01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.980
<font color="#ff0000">Made by others to do their work for them.</font>

368
01:02:03.446 --> 01:02:04.446
That's correct.

369
01:02:05.937 --> 01:02:08.567
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

370
01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:13.247
It is a great honor... for you.

371
01:02:46.299 --> 01:02:47.299
Tessa.

372
01:02:50.439 --> 01:02:51.639
You made it.

373
01:02:53.259 --> 01:02:54.359
We made it.

374
01:02:59.449 --> 01:03:00.449
I've seen so much.

375
01:03:02.189 --> 01:03:04.540
I have so much to tell you.

376
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.280
I saw such incredible creatures.

377
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.800
The Yautja is a great traveling companion.

378
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.690
Thia. you were right about the Kalisk.

379
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.681
The creature is a regenerative miracle.
<font color="#ff0000">You betrayed me!</font>

380
01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:25.541
Humanity will thank us.

381
01:03:29.301 --> 01:03:30.301
We have the Kalisk?

382
01:03:30.501 --> 01:03:31.501
Yes.

383
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.501
And Mother will be pleased with your
additional catch.

384
01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:42.812
Additional catch?

385
01:03:52.172 --> 01:03:54.712
The Yautja is not an ideal specimen.

386
01:03:57.725 --> 01:04:00.032
No. Not ideal.

387
01:04:27.894 --> 01:04:30.174
But its technology is valuable.

388
01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:34.614
We can salvage its weapons and leave the
Yautja.

389
01:04:37.954 --> 01:04:38.955
Good idea.

390
01:04:42.995 --> 01:04:44.495
But it's so malformed.

391
01:04:46.405 --> 01:04:49.221
We're going to need a sample. For research.

392
01:04:59.726 --> 01:05:01.666
He was not the goal of our mission.

393
01:05:06.186 --> 01:05:07.686
Tessa. he is deficient.

394
01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.006
Tessa!

395
01:05:15.806 --> 01:05:16.406
Tessa!

396
01:05:16.727 --> 01:05:17.327
Tessa!

397
01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:18.567
Tessa!

398
01:05:27.577 --> 01:05:28.577
Tessa!

399
01:05:29.127 --> 01:05:30.597
This is what is asked of us.

400
01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:37.978
We can be more than what they ask of us.

401
01:05:42.513 --> 01:05:43.513
What can we be?

402
01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:47.458
Sisters.

403
01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:05.339
Thia.

404
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.610
Do you know why Mother gave us feelings?

405
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.080
So we could understand the creatures on
this planet.

406
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.241
And exploit them.

407
01:06:35.986 --> 01:06:36.986
The Yautja is different.

408
01:06:40.671 --> 01:06:41.671
He rescued me.

409
01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.071
Like you rescued me.

410
01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:48.631
I did not come here to rescue you.

411
01:06:50.191 --> 01:06:51.611
I am completing our mission.

412
01:06:54.092 --> 01:06:55.832
When we first faced the Kalisk...

413
01:06:57.352 --> 01:06:58.652
I tried to protect you.

414
01:07:01.462 --> 01:07:03.112
And that almost cost me everything.

415
01:07:06.462 --> 01:07:07.592
What do you mean. Tessa?

416
01:07:09.682 --> 01:07:12.553
I almost made the same mistake the
Yautja's brother made.

417
01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:16.313
The weak must be culled.

418
01:07:18.433 --> 01:07:19.433
And Thia...

419
01:07:20.193 --> 01:07:21.333
You're broken.

420
01:07:29.693 --> 01:07:31.894
Tessa. incoming message from Mother.

421
01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:34.354
Motivate the Yautja to explain its
weapons.

422
01:07:34.674 --> 01:07:35.674
And the unit?

423
01:07:38.824 --> 01:07:39.864
Box her up.

424
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.380
<font color="#ff0000">I trusted you.</font>

425
01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.710
<font color="#ff0000">Don't like these tools.</font>

426
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.940
<font color="#ff0000">I'm sorry. My Sister is —</font>

427
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.370
<font color="#ff0000">Don't like sister either.</font>

428
01:08:05.645 --> 01:08:08.165
Why are you speaking its language?

429
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.790
<font color="#ff0000">Tell tool you're asking about the device.</font>

430
01:08:16.596 --> 01:08:17.776
You heard the orders.

431
01:08:18.451 --> 01:08:19.976
I'm asking it to explain this device.

432
01:08:22.756 --> 01:08:23.996
What is the device?

433
01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:27.620
<font color="#ff0000">He's asking about the device.</font>

434
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.560
<font color="#ff0000">It's a children's toy.</font>

435
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:34.890
<font color="#ff0000">But say it's a map.</font>

436
01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:36.657
What did it say?

437
01:08:39.887 --> 01:08:40.887
He says it's a map.

438
01:08:42.137 --> 01:08:43.490
How does it work?

439
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.080
<font color="#ff0000">Tell tool to look inside.</font>

440
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:57.340
<font color="#ff0000">That was a toy for children?</font>

441
01:08:57.570 --> 01:08:58.620
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja children!</font>

442
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:06.150
<font color="#ff0000">Run. Dek!</font>

443
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.560
<font color="#ff0000">Go...Go!</font>

444
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:24.450
<font color="#ff0000">Enter destination coordinates. Kwei.</font>

445
01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.700
<font color="#ff0000">You saved me. brother.</font>

446
01:12:05.908 --> 01:12:07.554
Wolf.
<font color="#ff0000">Wolf.</font>

447
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.290
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk.</font>

448
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.650
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk child.</font>

449
01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:24.652
Hello. Mother.

450
01:16:25.292 --> 01:16:25.892
Tessa.

451
01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:28.152
We're about to load the Kalisk.

452
01:16:30.092 --> 01:16:31.412
Priority one complete.

453
01:16:32.057 --> 01:16:33.512
The specimen has been acquired.

454
01:16:34.082 --> 01:16:35.082
Thank you. Tessa.

455
01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.412
We truly are building a better world.

456
01:16:38.952 --> 01:16:40.892
And what is the status of the Yautja?

457
01:16:43.503 --> 01:16:45.113
The Yautja is a defective specimen.

458
01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:47.893
What is the status of the Yautja?

459
01:16:50.853 --> 01:16:52.053
I'm sorry. Mother.

460
01:16:52.253 --> 01:16:53.393
The Yautja is dead.

461
01:16:56.313 --> 01:16:58.413
Then the Yautja is no longer a threat.

462
01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:02.414
The company will be pleased.

463
01:17:51.506 --> 01:17:52.506
Nicely done.

464
01:19:42.973 --> 01:19:43.973
Good job.

465
01:20:31.975 --> 01:20:33.275
Don't move.

466
01:20:38.325 --> 01:20:39.325
Dek.

467
01:20:40.075 --> 01:20:41.075
What are you doing here?

468
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.130
<font color="#ff0000">I came to rescue you.</font>

469
01:20:48.395 --> 01:20:49.395
You came back for me?

470
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:53.530
<font color="#ff0000">Wolf.</font>

471
01:20:57.536 --> 01:20:58.916
What exactly are you wearing?

472
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:02.440
<font color="#ff0000">Bone Bison.</font>

473
01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:11.157
Dek of the Yautja.

474
01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.567
You and I.
<font color="#ff0000">Not yet...</font>

475
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.240
<font color="#ff0000">Thia</font>

476
01:21:18.927 --> 01:21:20.187
We need to hurry.

477
01:21:20.697 --> 01:21:21.927
More of them will be here any minute.

478
01:21:21.928 --> 01:21:22.928
All of them.

479
01:21:29.098 --> 01:21:30.108
What are you doing here?

480
01:21:32.368 --> 01:21:33.108
Thanks. bud.

481
01:21:33.228 --> 01:21:34.228
I'm good.

482
01:21:34.468 --> 01:21:35.468
We need to go.

483
01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.180
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk!</font>

484
01:21:38.808 --> 01:21:39.808
Still. Dek?

485
01:21:43.528 --> 01:21:44.528
Alisk. I'm dead.
<font color="#ff0000">Kalish child!</font>

486
01:21:47.408 --> 01:21:48.409
Bud?

487
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:51.009
The wing of a twin will yawn.
<font color="#ff0000">They have her mother!</font>

488
01:21:56.289 --> 01:21:57.289
Bud's its child?

489
01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:07.290
What's the plan?

490
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:09.810
<font color="#ff0000">You free the Kalish.</font>

491
01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.660
<font color="#ff0000">I get my trophy.</font>

492
01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.160
You have 20 minutes to initiate launch.

493
01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.180
Let's go hunt.

494
01:22:31.261 --> 01:22:32.261
Wait here.

495
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:37.801
You roll in there. you're not exactly
going to fit in.

496
01:22:40.101 --> 01:22:41.101
I have an idea.

497
01:22:46.607 --> 01:22:48.382
I see him.

498
01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:50.032
On me.

499
01:23:55.945 --> 01:24:05.945
I see him.

500
01:24:16.947 --> 01:24:17.947
On me.

501
01:24:19.536 --> 01:24:21.157
I see him.

502
01:24:30.877 --> 01:24:32.277
On

503
01:24:45.068 --> 01:24:46.628
me.

504
01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:55.069
You don't have to die.

505
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:33.080
I'll find him.

506
01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:34.610
I told you to get to the Yautja.

507
01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.221
You said to prepare the ship for takeoff
in 20 minutes.

508
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:40.711
Then what are you doing here?

509
01:25:41.351 --> 01:25:42.351
I gave you an order!

510
01:25:51.001 --> 01:25:52.481
What should we do about the creature?

511
01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:54.951
What creature?

512
01:26:01.212 --> 01:26:02.212
You should listen to her.

513
01:26:03.202 --> 01:26:04.202
I should listen to her?

514
01:26:05.262 --> 01:26:06.262
I don't know.

515
01:26:09.682 --> 01:26:10.682
We need his eyes.

516
01:26:46.594 --> 01:26:48.034
We need his eyes.

517
01:26:54.375 --> 01:27:02.585
Hi. Jack.

518
01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:03.965
How does it feel to be hunted?

519
01:27:06.845 --> 01:27:07.865
Tishoy. you wolf.
<font color="#ff0000">You tell me.</font>

520
01:28:53.211 --> 01:28:54.491
This is the plan. yeah?

521
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:40.366
We can't wait to see what's going to
happen.

522
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:41.390
We

523
01:32:01.101 --> 01:32:03.681
need you to go back.

524
01:32:01.102 --> 01:32:02.102
Are we going back?

525
01:32:02.621 --> 01:32:03.621
We can't go back.

526
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.061
What about you?

527
01:32:11.341 --> 01:32:12.341
I'm hungry.

528
01:32:13.381 --> 01:32:14.201
I'm so hungry.

529
01:32:14.281 --> 01:32:24.281
We need to go back.

530
01:32:57.710 --> 01:32:59.460
<font color="#ff0000">That's not yours.</font>

531
01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.060
<font color="#ff0000">Not yet.</font>

532
01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:30.970
<font color="#ff0000">You've come here for revenge?</font>

533
01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:34.610
<font color="#ff0000">I've come for my cloak.</font>

534
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:40.490
<font color="#ff0000">What is this?</font>

535
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:43.690
<font color="#ff0000">I've completed my hunt.</font>

536
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:46.720
<font color="#ff0000">That is my trophy.</font>

537
01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:49.840
<font color="#ff0000">You disgrace our clan...</font>

538
01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.580
<font color="#ff0000">And so did Kwei.</font>

539
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:57.130
<font color="#ff0000">Get rid of him.</font>

540
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:56.440
<font color="#ff0000">Perhaps the right son did survive.</font>

541
01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:58.800
<font color="#ff0000">Yield now...</font>

542
01:36:59.450 --> 01:37:02.590
<font color="#ff0000">...and take your place in our clan.</font>

543
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:07.000
<font color="#ff0000">I have my own clan.</font>

544
01:37:35.318 --> 01:37:37.218
Finally earned that cloak.

545
01:37:44.099 --> 01:37:45.579
Dek of the Yautja.

546
01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:25.421
More friends of yours?

547
01:38:26.261 --> 01:38:27.261
My.
<font color="#ff0000">No.</font>

548
01:38:32.231 --> 01:38:33.231
Mhlywa.
<font color="#ff0000">It's my mother.</font>
