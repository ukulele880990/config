Still had the offer?

3
00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.054
Maybe a fresh start
would be good.

339
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.165
[Loretta] Hmm.

-[Loretta screaming]

341
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.801
This room is off limits.

342
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:33.349
I'm so. so. so sorry to
scream out like that.

343
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.434
Um...

344
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.397
[with Cajun accent] Uh.
it's. um. PTSD from the well.

345
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.275
but I... I won't... I won't
bore you with the whole story.

346
00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:46.112
Name's Emily Lawler. just up
here by way of Natchitoches.

347
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.656
Big change for a little
swamp girl like me.

348
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.994
I was headin' on. uh. up the
stairs and I heard "Vissi d'arte."

349
00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.579
You know Tosca?

350
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.038
Oh. do I!

351
00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:01.210
I played the Maria Callas part
in my senior year at Lafayette.

352
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:05.089
Is that Floria
Tosca's... dagger?

353
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.467
This is the same one
Maria Callas used

354
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.803
in her final performance
of Tosca at The Met.

355
00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.640
-Oh...
-Isn't it wonderful?

356
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:18.811
My husband came across it
at a police repo auction.

357
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.980
-Mm.
-On our 10th anniversary.

358
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.732
It was perfect!

359
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.027
He died this month.

360
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.111
Oh.

361
00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.238
My condolences.

362
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.699
I lost mine this past year.

363
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.077
[normal voice] In a
fire. I lost everything.

364
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.829
-[sighs] Oh.
-So...

365
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.790
[resumes Cajun accent]
Is this your lucky fella?

366
00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:42.376
No. no. no. I was his lucky gal.

367
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.671
And we were married for
30 years. and every night

368
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.840
he would come home and
kiss me on the head.

369
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.218
And then one night.
no kiss and...

370
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:53.971
he was gone.

371
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.891
Yeah. he fell into the fountain

372
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.435
of the courtyard
where we married.

373
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.520
[sighs]

374
00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.313
Hmm.

375
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.273
Look at that
woodwork! [laughing]

376
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.900
You don't see moldings
like that no more.

377
00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.152
-Oh. my God.
-Yeah. 100% pine.

378
00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:09.404
-Are you serious?
-On my mother...

379
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.364
-I would not lie to you. my friend.
-Ah!

380
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.157
[coughing] Listen. uh.

381
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:17.245
not for nothing. uh.
what's your credit score?

382
00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.663
[realtor explosively coughing]

383
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.081
Excuse me one sec.

384
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:22.416
I'll be right back.
[continues coughing loudly]

387
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:34.053
There are the bags.
Ah. look at them.

388
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.807
[Young Oliver] Al. Sue. come on!

389
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.728
I'm asking you. please. The
play's not a waste of time.

390
00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.231
-I think you'll like it.
-Look enough of this.

391
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.150
We're not going to any
play. and neither are you.

392
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.236
We took him in. If
he's got any free time.

393
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.196
he can work at
the goddamn store.

394
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.865
-Ah. don't be difficult now.
-[Young Oliver sighs]

395
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:58.035
And it'll feel good for you
to contribute to this house.

396
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.454
-Aw.
-Al!

397
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.456
[Young Oliver] Not fair.

-If I may.
-Hmm?

401
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.008
Why are you sellin'?

402
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.760
I would give anything
to at least have my home

403
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.637
and my... my stuff back.

404
00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.015
Yeah. I thought I'd feel
the same way. but...

405
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:23.352
you know. I look around.
and honestly. I...

406
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.772
I don't want any of this.

407
00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.107
I want him.

[♪ Gentle pensive music playing]

409
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.446
Yeah.

410
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.158
And. anyway. it's not like
I can afford to stay here.

411
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.951
I'm even selling the dagger.

412
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.622
My son thinks I can get
$500 for this on eBay.

413
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.290
-Yeah.
-Oh. Mm.

414
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.125
You wouldn't want
this. would you?

415
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.673
So. you didn't find the bag.
but you gave our suspect $500

416

-to keep a weapon?
-[sighs]

417
00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.761
You didn't find a bag
either. [sniffles]

418
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.180
Uh. side note. how
much cash do you carry?

419
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.474
Oh. you know I
don't trust banks.

played me like a fuckin' fiddle.

-Howard. we need Robot Lester's help.

He prefers "LESTR."

438
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.152
You can use "Human
Lester" for the dead one.

439
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:59.699
Oh. speaking of. I've styled new LESTR up
a bit more dashingly than the last one.

440
00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:01.867
So. what do you need?
LESTR can do anything.

441
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.036
Except cleanup spills. We're
still shy around water.

442
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.872
[LESTR robot] I got
killed by water yesterday.

gonna keep you dry.

You're safe with Howard.

of Charles' front door
from last night around...

creeping around?

448
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.846
With Seth Rogen? Around 2:30.

449
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.597
Ooh. I'm so excited.
I did a clue.

-LESTR. 2:30.

-[LESTR robot] Gotcha. Daddy.

452
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.144
[Charles-Haden Savage]
Is that grooming?

453
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.771
Now. at the academy they
prepared us for a lot of stuff.

454
00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.899
but I ain't never seen no
shit like this. I'm shook.

455
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.444
-Okay. this is 1:00 to 3:00 a.m.
-[LESTR whirring]

456
00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.070
-Let me know when to stop.
-Okay.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.948
I was wearing my red feather cape.
couture. gifted by Donatella.

458
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.575
-Yeah?
-She raises. plucks.

459
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.618
and slaughters the birds.
humanely. of course.

460
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.829
So. just look for
plumes. I'll pop.

[footage whirring]

462
00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.541
[Mabel] Yeah. I don't
see any feathers.

463
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.626
Are you sure this
is the right time?

464
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.462
LESTR doesn't make mistakes.

465
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.756
Well. I think he did.
because I was there.

466
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.591
Were you. though? I mean.

467
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.553
maybe you were just telling a
story about your celebrity friend.

468
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.514
and pretend you saw
something that you didn't see

469
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.015
just because you have to make it

470
00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.767
-all about you.
-Mora!

471
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.561
Oh. Okay. yep. right
there. See. look.

472
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.230
Can you go back to it
again. but just go slower?

473
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.481
[Howard Morris] Here you go.

474
00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.693
[footage glitching]

475
00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.696
-[Charles] Was that...
-Humane fuckin' feathers.

476
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.491
Someone cut a chunk out of the
footage. They tampered with it.

477
00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.785
I'll bet that's when
they took the finger.

478
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.788
Which means...

479
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.165
Althea was telling the truth.

480
00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.708
Yep.

481
00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.669
Well. Charles and I are
gonna go to the precinct.

482
00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.629
because if the cops have
any footage of Lester

483
00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.923
falling into the
fountain. I wanna see it.

484
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.174
What about me?

485
00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:42.551
You need to go and
apologize to that girl.

Should we try to get closer?

488
00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.268
No. no. no. I don't
want them to see us.

489
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:54.313
Also. the bod's starting to
tighten up. Did you pack a banana?

490
00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:57.233
Hey. how's it going today?
Do you care about dogs dying?

491
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.985
-Well. obviously. yes.
-Oh. my God. yes. of course.

492
00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:01.112
Well. I'm collecting signatures
to stop New York City

493
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.072
from opening its
first ever casino.

494
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.825
Right now. there's a few competing bids.
They're all just terrible for the city.

495
00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:07.368
-So. if you could just...
-Wait a minute. sorry.

496
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.745
What does that have
to do with dogs?

497
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.788
[chuckles] Oh. uh. nothing. I
just find it's a helpful way

498
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.373
to get people to stop.
you know what I'm saying?

499
00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.333
-Oh. my God. they're gone!
-Oh. geez. Ah!

500
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.918
-Uh. anyway...
-Saboteur!

501
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.044
[panting]

502
00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:19.088
-Oh. God. where'd they go?
-We lost them.

503
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.841
Maybe we should head on up

Or no.

505
00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.595
No. we should go back to her house
and wait for them there. okay?

506
00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.013
Oliver. what are you doing?

507
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.890
I didn't think this
would still be here.

508

[Loretta gasping]

510
00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:36.147
Just for a minute. can
I show you something?

-This is it.
-What?

516
00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:54.456
The theater that
made me love theater.

Oh. Oh. man.

Well. it wasn't
exactly like that.

No?

523
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.560
I was a... a quiet kid.

-No. it's true. I was.

If you make yourself small...

maybe a family will let
you stay for a while.

530
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.494
So. I did. and it worked.

531
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.456
But I never...

532
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:37.958
felt at home.

533
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:44.131
Until one day... I
stumbled into here.

[kids clamoring]

537
00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:51.931
...and they were big. and
loud. and unapologetic.

538
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:55.309
-And I... I wanted to be just like them.
-Yeah.

539
00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:56.769
[Oliver] They asked me
to be in their play.

-[Loretta] Uh-huh?
-[Oliver] Bit part.

541
00:23:58.062 --> 00:24:00.481
but being on that
stage was the feeling

542
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:03.609
that I'd been searching
for my whole life.

543
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.486

But when I worked up the
courage to invite Sue and Al...

546
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.870
they just...

547
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.416
I quit the play.

-I snuck out...

-to leave the Arconia.
-Hmm.

561
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.757
