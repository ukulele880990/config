- You Carl.

177
00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:20.542
I'm not Carl.

178
00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.167

You are under arrest. Carl.

186

The CID has reliable information
that after escaping from Tihar Jail.

187
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.833
Carl is now in Mumbai.

188
00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:00.375
Will you be able to catch him again?

189
00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:02.542
[officer] Excuse me. sir.

190
00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:05.250
Fifteen years ago.
Carl was just a common thief.

191
00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.167
But in these 15 years.
he's committed 32 murders.

192
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.083
He's broken out of jail five times
in four countries.

193
00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:13.375
It's not that easy to catch Carl now. sir.

194
00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.292
He is Interpol's Most Wanted Criminal.

195
00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:19.458
What do you know about him. Zende?

196
00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:31.375
Have you suddenly turned into the third

Mother. Lebanese. Father. Indian Sindhi.

201
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.083
When Carl was a child.
his father abandoned him and his mother.

202
00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:46.750
It was after this that his mother
got married to a Frenchman.

203
00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:49.792
He lived with his mother and the Frenchman
in France for a few years.

204
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:52.833
He is part Indian. part Lebanese.
and part French.

205
00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:55.000
But a complete and utter criminal.

211
00:13:28.292 --> 00:13:31.875
He's handsome. like a movie star.
and a sweet-talking smooth operator.

212
00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.292
He can get anyone to do anything he wants.

214

That criminal who escaped from jail
a few days ago.

219
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.208
There were two men on my flight
from Delhi to Bombay.

220
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.292
They had his picture.

221
00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:18.417
They must have been policemen.

222
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.125
By the way. what's your name?

223
00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:29.250

His first murder was of an American girl
named Angela Norton.

He mixed some sleeping pills
into her drink

230

and then proceeded to kill her
by drowning her in the sea in Thailand.

And then. there was Josephine.
And many more such women were murdered.

235
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:14.375
All the women who were murdered
were found wearing swimsuits.

"the Swimsuit Killer".</i>

<i>For Money? Jewellery?
Passports? For thrills?</i>

241
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:33.792
<i>It could be any reason.</i>

242
00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:37.375
<i>He's been arrested five times.
and managed to escape every single time.</i>

243
00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:41.667

have dubbed him "the Snake".</i>

However venomous a snake may be. sir.

247

the mongoose always beats the snake.

248

So. you are our mongoose. are you?

249
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.375

347
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.101
- [Zende] Man. it's not him.
- [Patil] It's the same guy. sir.

348
00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:28.125
Hello. Where are you from-from?

349
00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:30.625
[in French] Let me go!

350
00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:32.601
Look at his moustache.
It's a different moustache.

351
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.726
If I had a moustache.
I would look very different too.

352
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.958
- Sir. he bit me!
- Calm down. you mother...

353
00:21:37.042 --> 00:21:39.583
- Sir. sir. should we just… What do we do?
- Okay. let's take him.

354
00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:41.375
- Hey. you. move! Move! Come on!
- Take him.

355
00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:44.542
- [guest grunting]
- [inspector] Hey. move it! Move!

356
00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.417
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Rascal! Come on.

357
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.500
- Come on.
- Keep walking.

358
00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:50.208
- Push him. Push him hard!
- [in French] Let go of me.

359
00:21:50.292 --> 00:21:52.667
- I hate you all.
- [in English] Hey. stop. Hey. go inside.

360
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.958
- Hey. Matre. Lift him up. Hurry up! Move!
- Move! Yeah. yeah!

361
00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:58.958
[clamouring]

362
00:21:59.042 --> 00:22:03.042
[intense heroic music playing]

363
00:22:50.292 --> 00:22:52.833
[Patil] Sir!
We are not able to hold him. sir!

364
00:22:52.917 --> 00:22:55.083
Please. come quickly! Hey. stop!

365
00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:58.208
[cunning music playing]

366
00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:04.083
[clamouring]

367
00:23:04.167 --> 00:23:05.417
Stop it! Stop!

368
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.625
[official] This is disgraceful.
DGP Purandhare.

369
00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:11.208
Very shameful.

370
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.000
You should suspend
that idiotic inspector immediately.

371
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.042
How could he get the wrong man?

372
00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:18.625
And that too. a foreign national?

373
00:23:18.708 --> 00:23:22.375
Do you have any idea what a huge issue
the French Embassy has turned this into?

374
00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:24.042
Mr Swamy. tell him.

375
00:23:26.792 --> 00:23:30.792
Mr Swamy works with Interpol
on behalf of our country.

376
00:23:30.875 --> 00:23:32.833
International pressure
is building up. sir.

377
00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.167
[mysterious music playing]

378
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.625
The victims of more than 32 murders
committed by Carl

379
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.375
are Americans and Europeans.

380
00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:41.542
That's why we're under a lot of pressure
from these powerful nations.

381
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.708
It's been three days
since he escaped from Tihar

382
00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:45.667
and we're nowhere close to catching him.

383
00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:49.042
And with this wrongful arrest
made by the Mumbai Police.

384
00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:52.125
it has made matters worse.

385
00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:54.500
We tried our best. sir.

386
00:23:54.583 --> 00:23:57.167
- But...
- But. clearly. your best is not the best.

387
00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:01.542
[Purandhare] I don't appreciate
getting an ass-kicking from someone else.

388
00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:05.000
Yes. sir. I've been telling you
to give the case to someone new.

389
00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:07.226
Will you come with me
to the cattle market?

390
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.167
- What. sir?
- To buy a couple of bulls?

391
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.750
- Sir. bulls?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:17.208
With your blessings. the department
is sure to give me an early retirement.

393
00:24:17.792 --> 00:24:21.042
"Sorry. sir. I think. uh.
I'll go and do some farming."

394
00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:24.417
Because at least.
the bulls will obey my orders.

395
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.000
Sir? But when have I not obeyed
your orders. sir?

396
00:24:27.083 --> 00:24:30.667
I have assigned this case to you.
and you are going to catch him.

397
00:24:31.542 --> 00:24:34.750
- Anyway. do you have a lead? Where is he?
- No. sir.

398
00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:38.292
Ever since Airport Plaza. I have searched
all the five-star and four-star hotels.

399
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:39.583
He is not in Mumbai. sir.

400
00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:43.917
Wherever he is. I want to see
the Mumbai Police capture Carl's wicket.

401
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.500
- [Zende] Yes. sir.
- Caught by Mumbai Police.

402
00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:49.583
- Bowled by Mumbai Police.
- [Zende] Yes. sir.

403
00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:53.667
You want to dive with me?

404
00:24:55.292 --> 00:24:58.667
No. No. sir. If my clothes get wet.
the Commissioner will tear my head off.

405
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.167
- Commissioner?
- [stammering] My wife. sir.

406
00:25:05.375 --> 00:25:06.875
Well. sir. go ahead.

407
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.833
[tense music playing]

408
00:25:09.917 --> 00:25:14.208
If we don't nab Carl.
the Ministry will tear our heads off.

409
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.875
[mischievous music playing]

410
00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:26.917
[taxi metre rings]

411
00:26:22.042 --> 00:26:24.042
[scribbling]

412
00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:38.333
- Zende. sir?
- Yes. sir.

413
00:26:38.417 --> 00:26:39.417
Let him pass.

414
00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.375
Sir. Inspector Jacob.

415
00:26:43.958 --> 00:26:46.958
Oh. Purandhare sir
had spoken to me about you.

416
00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:48.333
- I see.
- Yeah.

417
00:26:48.417 --> 00:26:51.500
Purandhare sir handed over
Carl Bhojraj's file to me today.

418
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.583
Our old friend has left
a little love letter for us.

419
00:26:59.667 --> 00:27:01.667
That bastard.

420
00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:05.000
[Zende] We'll have to meet him soon
and tell him

421
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:08.417
that "Bombay Police love you." too.

422
00:27:12.792 --> 00:27:14.792
His wife is also mentioned
in the file. sir.

423
00:27:15.292 --> 00:27:16.417
Chantaal.

424
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.000
Chantaal is his wife's name.

425
00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:19.750
[smacks lips] Chantelle. sir.

426
00:27:19.833 --> 00:27:21.333
- Huh? Huh?
- Chantelle.

427
00:27:21.417 --> 00:27:24.125
- No. Mrs Zende. No. No more.
- What? Come on. It's okay. Have some.

428
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.042
But the spelling starts with C-H. right?

429
00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:30.875
So C-H is usually
pronounced "cha". Chantaal?

430
00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:35.583
Uh. the spelling may be C-H. sir.
but it's pronounced "Shantelle."

431
00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:39.375
- Chantelle. That's so weird.
- Mmm.

432
00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:44.458
They write "cha". pronounce it "sha".
and we get shooed in the middle. [Laughs]

433
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.875
Don't you ever laugh. Jacob?

434
00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:56.375
- Me?
- Mmm.

435
00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.833
I am laughing. sir.

436
00:28:00.167 --> 00:28:01.750
[inhales sharply] Okay. okay.

437
00:28:02.917 --> 00:28:07.375
You know. this wife of Carl's left him
a very long ago.

438
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:09.458
But they haven't gotten divorced yet.
you know.

439
00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:12.417
So the royalties from all the books
written about Carl

440
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.167
go straight into an account that

441
00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.500
Chantaal…

442
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:19.042
Chantelle holds in her own name.

443
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:20.292
- [spouse] Listen.
- Hmm?

444
00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:21.375
Tea.

445
00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:25.875
Sir. his wife is somewhere abroad. right?

446
00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:27.667
In America.

447
00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:29.875
[sucks teeth] Ow.

448
00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:32.042
- Here. here. here. Here you go.
- [stammers] Sir.

449
00:28:35.833 --> 00:28:37.458
- What do you think. Jacob?
- Sir?

450
00:28:37.542 --> 00:28:39.167
Where could Carl be right now?

451
00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:44.417
He could be anywhere. sir.
Jaipur. Jodhpur. Goa. Pondicherry.

452
00:28:45.292 --> 00:28:47.333
<i>Where there are usually a lot
of foreigners.</i>

453
00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:49.333
<i>They are the people he targets.</i>

454
00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:51.708
<i>He must be in a place where. as usual.</i>

455
00:28:51.792 --> 00:28:55.208
<i>he's staying in a five-star hotel
under a false name.</i>

456
00:28:55.292 --> 00:28:56.917
[devious music playing]

457
00:28:58.875 --> 00:29:01.667
MUMBAI
SATARA / PANVEL BUS STOP

458
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.250
Hey! Hey! Brother. listen!

459
00:29:05.333 --> 00:29:06.333
Brother! Carl!

460
00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:08.292
No names.

461
00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:11.542
You said you'd take me to America. man.

462
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.542
What the hell is this place?

463
00:29:14.333 --> 00:29:17.833
The road to America
goes straight through Panvel. my friend.

464
00:29:17.917 --> 00:29:19.542
[music continues]

465
00:29:29.208 --> 00:29:32.351
[inspector] Ever since we received your
Look Out Notice. we've been on alert. sir.

466
00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:34.167
He was going to take
the Gorakhpur Express.

467
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.542
We picked him up.

468
00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:38.750
and when we checked his bag.
this is what we found in it.

469
00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:39.917
[mysterious music playing]

470
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.042
Ratan Tomar.

471
00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:44.875
Out of the five people who escaped from
Tihar with Carl. this is one of them. sir.

472
00:29:44.958 --> 00:29:46.750
<i>But he says his name is Ajay Agarwal.</i>

473
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.500
Hello. Tomar.

474
00:29:49.583 --> 00:29:51.375
Hey. who is this Tomar. bro...

475
00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:55.958
My name… My name isn't Tomar. sir.

476
00:29:56.042 --> 00:29:58.583
I am Agarwal.
Ajay Agarwal. the businessman.

477
00:29:59.208 --> 00:30:02.250
Sir. I swear to God that bag isn't mine.
I found it lying around.

478
00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.958
I must have been crazy
to have picked it up.

479
00:30:05.042 --> 00:30:06.667
Why are your legs all swollen up?

480
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.750
Legs?

481
00:30:08.833 --> 00:30:10.292
I fell down as a child.

482
00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:12.458
But I'm all right now. sir.

483
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.792
What you need is a good massage.

484
00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:16.000
Massage?

485
00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:17.917
Hasn't anyone massaged them?

486
00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:21.375
My mother did when I was a boy.

487
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.500
[Zende] No mother anymore?

488
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.750
Don't you worry.

489
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.667
Your father is here now.

490
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:28.750
Gawde!

491
00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:30.750
- [Tomar groans softly]
- Yes. sir?

492
00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:32.000
Go get the lizard oil.

493
00:30:32.083 --> 00:30:33.083
Lizard oil?

494
00:30:34.042 --> 00:30:36.375
- [stammering] Uh. why?
- So. Tomar.

495
00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:39.500
[stammering] Not Tomar. sir.
I told you I am Agarwal.

496
00:30:39.583 --> 00:30:41.792
- Ajay Agarwal. reputed businessman.
- Mmm.

497

Ball.

498
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.500
You know that cricket match between India
and Pakistan that's happening in Sharjah?

499
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.667
- Who is going to win it?
- Huh?

500
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.208
- Who is going to win?
- [gasps]

501
00:30:52.292 --> 00:30:54.208
- Who is going to win it?
- [stammers. chuckles]

502
00:30:54.292 --> 00:30:56.958
Sir. I don't understand cricket at all.

503
00:30:57.042 --> 00:30:59.792
I'm a. uh. hockey fan. sir. Always been.

504
00:31:01.583 --> 00:31:03.083
- Sir. Oil.
- [Zende] Mmm?

505
00:31:04.458 --> 00:31:05.625
Lizard oil.

506
00:31:06.208 --> 00:31:08.042
Sir… [shakily] I am fine. sir.

507
00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:12.667
[clears throat] So. Mr Agarwal...

508
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.875
Tomar… [stammers] Ajay Agarwal.

509
00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:15.958
Hmm.

510
00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:17.708
- Gawde.
- [Gawde] Sir.

511
00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:18.792
Here. take this.

512
00:31:19.542 --> 00:31:20.708
And give me a hanky.

513
00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:25.708
- Listen.
- [Gawde] Yes. sir?

514

00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:37.333
I'll earn in dollars and have lots of sex!

682
00:40:37.417 --> 00:40:40.500
Every night. different babe.
Foreign babes. [Chuckles]

683
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Am I right. Carl?

684
00:40:42.583 --> 00:40:43.917
Whatever you want.

685
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.750
Whatever I want?

686
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.583
I can do two together at one time!

687
00:40:48.667 --> 00:40:51.042
Sandwich! [Cackles]

688
00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:52.292
I've seen it in films.

689
00:40:52.375 --> 00:40:54.875
- [grunts. choking]
- [sinister music playing]

690
00:41:09.208 --> 00:41:11.250
Now. we only need two dead bodies.

691
00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:25.708
[bicycle bell rings]

692
00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:35.208
Sir.

693
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.250
Sir.

694
00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:40.167
- Zende.
- Yes. sir.

695
00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:47.250
- [children laughing]
- Come on. Off you go.

696
00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:51.750
Hey. hey… [stammers] God bless. God bless.

697
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:53.875
- Sir!
- Sir!

698
00:41:54.792 --> 00:41:59.833
I said I'd rather meet you outside the
office because this is a secret mission.

699
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.083
Sit down. Sit down. [Grunts]

700
00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:04.792
Sir. kokum juice.

701
00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:06.833
Oh. wow. Thank you.

702
00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:09.542
Commissioner?

703
00:42:10.167 --> 00:42:11.333
[stammering] Yes.

704
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:14.542
DGP. DGP Purandhare.

705
00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:15.625
Yes. sir.

706
00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:20.833
[chuckles]

707
00:42:20.917 --> 00:42:22.792
- Patil. have some.
- [Patil] Huh? Mmm.

708
00:42:28.708 --> 00:42:30.000
As I was saying…

709
00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:32.042
- Zende. please sit down. Come on.
- Yes.

710
00:42:32.125 --> 00:42:33.125
- Sit.
- Sir.

711
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:34.375
No. no. no. please sit down.

712
00:42:37.833 --> 00:42:39.417
- So…
- [bicycle bell rings]

713
00:42:40.417 --> 00:42:42.333
- Yes. sir?
- Yeah.

714
00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:43.958
[Zende chuckles]

715
00:42:44.042 --> 00:42:46.292
- Ah.
- Sir. please continue. I'll be right back.

716
00:42:46.375 --> 00:42:47.417
[Purandhare chuckles]

717
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.458
[comical music playing]

718
00:43:02.708 --> 00:43:04.542
- [door closes]
- [bicycles bell rings]

719
00:43:04.625 --> 00:43:06.625
This is a secret operation.

720
00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:10.083
And we are not taking any help
from Goa Police.

721
00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:11.333
[Jacob] Sir?

722
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.125
If we can get the help
of the local police.

723
00:43:14.208 --> 00:43:16.250
our work would get a lot easier. sir.

724
00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:19.250
If you want easy work. Jacob.

725
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.375
then why not open a grocery store?

726
00:43:23.042 --> 00:43:24.458
Sorry. sir.

727
00:43:25.042 --> 00:43:26.042
What do you think. Zende?

728
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:30.333
Sir. I don't want anyone else
to get the credit for our victory.

729
00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:34.208
And I don't want anyone else
to get the blame for our loss.

730
00:43:34.292 --> 00:43:36.458
- We are not losing. Zende.
- No. sir.

731
00:43:36.542 --> 00:43:38.042
We've already lost once.

732
00:43:38.125 --> 00:43:41.250
And I think love and defeat
should only be experienced once in life.

733
00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:42.917
Wow. what a line. sir.

734
00:43:46.042 --> 00:43:48.000
[Purandhare] Carl was in Mumbai
for four days.

735
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.417
And he gave Mumbai Police the slip
and got away.

736
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.917
Therefore. the Mumbai Police
must catch him.

737
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.708
And. secondly. even though we've sent
repeated notifications to the Goa Police.

738
00:43:58.792 --> 00:44:00.542
there's been no movement at their end.

739
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:03.667
That's why we have to do this job.

740
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.000
[upbeat music playing]

741
00:44:05.083 --> 00:44:07.917
Zende. tell me.
who are you taking with you?

742
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.292
Sir. Jacob. Patil.
and if this involves the Railway Police.

743
00:44:12.375 --> 00:44:13.833
- then Deshmane.
- Sir.

744
00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:17.375
And someone who speaks the local language.
so Mr Naik.

745
00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:19.792
- And Patekar.
- Sir.

746
00:44:19.875 --> 00:44:20.875
Good.

747
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:25.208
I don't want you using
your real names there.

748
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.042
Because if the mongoose knows the Snake.

749
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:32.542
then maybe the Snake
knows the mongoose too.

750
00:44:33.708 --> 00:44:36.250
The two of you go back 15 years. Zende.

751
00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:38.708
Got it. sir.

752
00:44:38.792 --> 00:44:39.792
All right.

753
00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:42.667
You will all take
an early-morning flight tomorrow.

754
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.333
[music stops]

755
00:44:45.875 --> 00:44:47.042
F-Flight?

[music resumes]

757
00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:54.000
What's wrong?

758
00:44:54.083 --> 00:44:57.625
You have. uh. never been on an airplane?

759
00:44:58.417 --> 00:44:59.417
No. sir.

760
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.833

- Huh?

[sentimental music playing]

762
00:45:27.167 --> 00:45:28.625
Oh. Surekha.

763
00:45:28.708 --> 00:45:31.208
You know the navy blue coat
that Prakash wears sometimes?

764
00:45:31.292 --> 00:45:32.667
- Yeah.
- I needed it for a few days.

765
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:34.917
- Sure. no problem. Okay.
- Okay. thank you.

766
00:45:36.708 --> 00:45:37.708
What did you tell her?

767
00:45:38.583 --> 00:45:40.167
That you're going through a wedding.

768
00:45:40.667 --> 00:45:42.208
Our mission's a secret. right?

769
00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:43.708
- Oh.
- Ha.

770
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:53.500
You are not going to Goa.

771
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.292
And now. what's wrong?

772
00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:57.708
- Hey. Carl can't do any...
- To hell with that stupid Carl.

773
00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:02.167
Surekha told me that all sorts of things
go on in five-star hotels in Goa.

774
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.708
- What?
- Those… Th-Those…

775
00:46:04.792 --> 00:46:05.917
[stammering] What "those"?

776
00:46:06.417 --> 00:46:08.625
Uh. you know. those… [scoffs]

777
00:46:08.708 --> 00:46:10.208
…ca-cabaret dancers.

778
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:15.250
They dance half-naked
with all sorts of feathers and things.

779
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.750
Really?

780
00:46:17.333 --> 00:46:18.542
Oh. show me. show me. How?

781
00:46:18.625 --> 00:46:21.667
Haven't you seen those women
who dance like this in the movies and…

782
00:46:24.083 --> 00:46:26.417
Surely. the things
you trick me into doing.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:41.917
Sir. he could have
fled the country in the last 15 days.

1025
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.125
So why is he still here?

1026
01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:46.583
He definitely wants to leave the country.

[unsettling music playing]

1028
01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:50.250
But to do that. he needs a passport.

1029
01:04:52.042 --> 01:04:54.292
And in order to get his hands on one.

1030
01:04:55.833 --> 01:04:57.833
he'll be willing to kill again.

Sir. Carl Bhojraj was in Mumbai and
yet our police weren't able to catch him.

- What do you have to say about that?
- Sir. where's Carl now?

Sir. is it true that he's given
the Mumbai Police the slip for good. sir?

Oh. wow. Congratulations. yeah. [Chuckles]

1059

And the thing is. uh.
he's really fond of puran poli.

1060
01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:18.208
So. uh. I have made some.

1061

uh. staying in Goa.

- Zende didn't tell you where he's staying?
- Sir.

1064

Isn't the mission a secret?

Yes. [Chuckles] Yeah.

1066
01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:36.208
So is it possible to get this box to him?

1067

Of course. Certainly.

1068

But I'll keep one piece for myself. okay?

1069
01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:42.792
Thing is. we only get abuse from people.

1070

- No. sir.

Don't take any from this one.

I've made you
another box of the same sweets.

Oh. my.

1075
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:56.958
In that case. I'll personally handle
these puran polis to Zende.

- Okay. children. Hurry up.

01:08:29.542 --> 01:08:31.958
One by one. Form a line. Form a line.

1086
01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:35.208
See that? Where did
so many Charlie Chaplins come from?

1087
01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:36.750
They're having a competition. sir.

1088
01:08:36.833 --> 01:08:38.714
Who will be
the best Charlie Chaplin? [Chuckles]

1089
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.083
Hey. don't you think
Jacob would nail this competition?

1090
01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:43.333
He just has to knock off
both sides of his moustache.

1091

[all chuckling]

1092
01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.333
Hey. You can't even laugh at yourself?

1093
01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:51.083
I'm laughing. sir.

1094
01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:52.833
- Oh.
- [all laughing]

1095
01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:56.226
- Sir. the chits are ready.
- [investigative music playing]

1096
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.167
Today. we are going to go out on our own.

1097
01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.292
Let's spread out a little more.

1098
01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:02.083
Let's cover a little more area.

1099
01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:04.167
The chits we pick
will decide who goes where.

1100
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.583
Sir. I have had one more name added
to the list.

1101
01:09:06.667 --> 01:09:08.542
- Which one?
- Divar Island.

1102
01:09:08.625 --> 01:09:10.917
It sits
in the middle of the Mandovi river.

1103
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.667
You have to go there by ferry.

1104
01:09:13.167 --> 01:09:15.625
I think
we should take a good look there. sir.

1105
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500
Okay.

1106
01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:19.792
[exhales deeply]

1107
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.208
[Patil sighing] Mmm.

1108
01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:30.708
Hmm. Arambol.

1109
01:09:31.708 --> 01:09:32.708
Candolim.

1110

[unsettling music playing]

1116
01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:08.518
And I asked him.
He said there were three people...

1117
01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:11.167
- Boys. is Patil back yet?
- Not yet. sir.

1118
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:14.000
[Jacob] Sir. look at this news. sir.
[breathing shakily]

1119
01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.917
Last night. the police found a man's body
on Anjuna beach.

1120
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.667
The man's a foreigner.
Someone burnt him alive. sir.

1121
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.583
And what's more. there was no passport
or anything found on him.

1122
01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:25.167
Sir. this is exactly
Carl's modus operandi.

[Patil] Sir.

1126
01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:31.375
What's wrong. Patil?

1127
01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:34.458
Sir. I saw him.

1128
01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:37.417
Saw whom?

1129
01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:39.625
I saw Carl. sir.

1130
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:41.042

[Zende] <i>And you just let him slip away?</i>

1135
01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.042
I got scared. sir.

1136
01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.333
He killed 32 people.

1137
01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:04.958
Most likely 33!

1138
01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:08.143
Sir. I'll go to the ferry and check.

1139
01:12:08.167 --> 01:12:09.559
What is the point of going there now. man?

1140
01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:13.042
Sir… [stammering] I don't know. sir.
but I have to go. sir.

1141
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.375
I have two children. sir.

1142
01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:22.083
- [breathing heavily]
- All I could see was their faces...

1143
01:12:22.167 --> 01:12:25.167
Then go tell your children
that their father is a coward!

1144
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.250
[dramatic music playing]

1145
01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:28.417
That the Most Wanted Criminal
in the whole world

1146
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.250
appeared right in front of their father.

1147
01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:33.167
who. despite being a cop.
did not even lift a finger!

1148
01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.083
And they will be very proud of you!

1149
01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:37.000
- Sir. but...
- Fear!

1150
01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:38.958
Everyone feels fear. Patil!

1151
01:12:39.042 --> 01:12:41.125
But remember. when you're a policeman.

1152
01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:43.333
fear shouldn't be a reason
for turning away.

1153
01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:46.875
It should be a chance to stand up
and face it with courage.

1154
01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:03.958
[pensive orchestral music playing]

1155
01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:30.000
Carl? Oh. so you are planning
to marry that criminal?

1156
01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:32.208
- [children laugh]
- [laughs]

[Zende] <i>Look. Commissioner.</i>

1158
01:13:35.083 --> 01:13:37.958
He who does not do wrong to others
is a good man.

<i>He who doesn't let himself be wronged

01:14:11.167 --> 01:14:12.500
So you remembered?

1169
01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:14.750
<i>I don't want you killing me. do I?</i>

1170
01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:16.792
You talk such rubbish.

1171
01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:21.250
<i>I'm mad at you. It took you three days
to finally find the time to call me.</i>

1172
01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:26.208
Okay. listen. I gave Purandhare sir a box
of puran polis to be delivered to you.

1173
01:14:26.292 --> 01:14:27.583
To Purandhare sir?

1174

Viju.

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:35.083
So?

1177
01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:36.583
I'm a wife.

1178
01:14:37.292 --> 01:14:40.250
If a wife can hold the fort at home
while her husband's on a mission.

- Viju. Carl has a wife!
- [comical music playing]

1184
01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:52.000
What about his wife. sir?

1185
01:14:52.083 --> 01:14:54.958
Carl's wife is in America. Chantaal.

1186
01:14:55.042 --> 01:14:57.167
- Chantelle.
- [stammers] Screw that name. yeah?

1187
01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.250
Just try to get my point. Jacob!

1188
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.458
All of Carl's money is kept with his wife.

1189
01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:04.375
Where's his wife? In America.

1190
01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:08.000
So. when Carl wants to talk to his wife
sometimes. where do you think he goes?

1191
01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:09.083
America?

1192
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:12.875
That means international calls.
The telephone exchange. sir?

1193
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:17.542
Exactly! So wherever Carl might go.
the whole team will have to follow.

1194
01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:23.750
[Jacob] Listen. Patekar.

1195
01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:25.792
Patekar!

1196
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.333
<i>There must be a register for all
the international calls made from here.</i>

1197
01:15:31.417 --> 01:15:32.625
<i>Can you show it to us?</i>

1198
01:15:33.292 --> 01:15:36.792
Even you know that in our country.
the only thing you get for free is air.

1199
01:15:37.375 --> 01:15:40.292
So if you want to talk business.
then go ahead or get lost.

1200
01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:43.833
- Go on.
- Huh?

1201
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:46.042
Pay him 20.

1202
01:15:48.167 --> 01:15:50.250
You mean we pay him?

1203
01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:55.792
[scoffs] Come on. How will I explain this
to the accounts department?

1204
01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:57.542
Where's the register?

1205
01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:03.625
You'll find the register on the table
in the cabin next to mine. Go take a look.

1206
01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:05.708
Come on. Let's go. let's go.

1207
01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:07.542
By the way…

1208
01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:12.625
The thing is. not too many people
come here to make overseas calls.

1209
01:16:12.708 --> 01:16:15.167
It's a government office
so there's a lot of paperwork.

1210
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.667
Somewhere in Porvorim. there's a bar.

1211
01:16:18.167 --> 01:16:19.292
- The owner and…
- [door opens]

1212
01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:23.000
- We have an arrangement.
- [door closes]

1213
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.917
Overseas calls are made there.

1214
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.792
One after the other.
Without paperwork. Mmm.

1215
01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:28.917
Bar's name?

1216
01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:30.583
[chuckles]

1217
01:16:31.167 --> 01:16:32.875
We have given you 20 rupees.

1218
01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:36.465
- [Carl] O'Coqueiro.
- [foreboding music playing]

1219
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:41.333
No. I will need it
as soon as I land in New York. [Scoffs]

1220
01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:44.292
It's my money. my dear.

1221
01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:47.167
<i>Oui</i>. And you are still my wife.

1222
01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:50.250
Yes.

1223
01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:56.250
Yes. I will call you soon.

1224
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:58.875
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1225
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.542
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1226
01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:14.417
[music intensifies]

1227
01:17:22.958 --> 01:17:28.333
Sir. suppose we manage to capture him
here in Goa. but what happens after that?

1228
01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:30.042
We hand him over to the Goa Police?

1229
01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:33.625
If we have to hand him over
to the Goa Police.

1230
01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:35.458
why the hell are we working on our own?

1231
01:17:35.542 --> 01:17:37.292
To tell you the truth. Jacob…

1232
01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:43.042
I don't want to get into this game
of getting all the credit.

1233
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.667
A criminal escaped from jail.

1234
01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.708
And after that he committed a murder.

1235
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.208
And since I'm a policeman.
I just want to catch the guy.

1236
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.250
Alone.

1237
01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:58.667
or with someone else.

1238
01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:02.167
It makes no damn difference to me.

1239
01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:06.167
Sir. I mean.
if we could take Patil with us...

1240
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:08.542
There's no place for cowards in this team.

1241
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.375
- Understand?
- Deshmane?

1242
01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.542
Oh!

1243
01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:18.583
Amdekar!
How are you? Where have you been?

1244
01:18:18.667 --> 01:18:20.875
We have a senior officer
down from Delhi. Vyas.

1245
01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:23.118
- [Deshmane] Oh.
- [Amdekar] Let me introduce you to him.

1246
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.208
What the hell. Sinha?

1247
01:18:25.292 --> 01:18:29.375
Sir. please meet a few of my friends
from the Mumbai Police.

1248
01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:31.625
And this is Vyas sir. Delhi Police.

1249
01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:35.167
It's been two weeks since
Carl Bhojraj escaped from Tihar Jail.

1250
01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:39.375
And that's why Vyas sir and his team
of 15 to 16 men are here to catch him.

1251
01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:43.042
Inspector Zende. sir.

1252
01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:47.667
Sir. we are also here
for the same purpose.

1253
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:52.042
Sir. Purandhare sir said
not to discuss these matters...

1254
01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:54.667
One minute.
We don't have time for this anymore.

1255
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:55.750
[tense music playing]

1256
01:18:55.833 --> 01:18:58.958
If we work together.
we'll catch Carl a lot faster.

1257
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.292
Sir. we've received a lead that
Carl Bhojraj will show up at this bar

1258
01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:07.208
because phone calls made from here

1259
01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:10.500
to any corner of the world
connect at lightning speed.

1260
01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:14.500
Carl's wife is in America and he will
most definitely come here to call her.

1261
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.000
First and foremost. Mr…

1262
01:19:17.083 --> 01:19:18.583
What did you say your name was?

1263
01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:20.417
- Oh. Madhukar Zende. sir.
- [Vyas] Mmm.

1264
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.000
I didn't ask you to sit.

1265
01:19:22.083 --> 01:19:24.917
[precarious music playing]

1266
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.292
I'm going to have to talk to the Home
Ministry about this unofficial operation

1267
01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:30.458
of the Bombay Police.

1268
01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:33.875
- Sinha. make a note of this.
- Sir. Yes. sir.

1269
01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:37.958
You Bombay boys don't
do a lot of homework. do you?

1270
01:19:38.042 --> 01:19:41.708
Maybe that's why Bhojraj spent four days
in Bombay after getting out of Tihar.

1271
01:19:41.792 --> 01:19:45.042
And these guys couldn't even
find a trace of him.

1272
01:19:45.792 --> 01:19:48.792
Bhojraj always stays five-star.

1273
01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:52.917
Why would he come to this dump
to make a phone call?

1274
01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:57.292
- Amdekar. let's go.
- Yes. sir.

1275
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.375
[Vyas] Come on.

1276
01:19:58.458 --> 01:19:59.750
[music fades]

1277
01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:01.333
- [Vyas] Who was that?
- [Zende] Sir!

1278
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:07.917
Your homework hasn't
been all that great either.

1279
01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:10.875
That's why. in your Tihar Jail.

1280
01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:14.000
he got permission to celebrate
his birthday on March 16th.

1281
01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.625
And under that pretext.
he served everyone pudding.

1282
01:20:18.417 --> 01:20:20.625
knocked them out. and escaped.

1283
01:20:21.708 --> 01:20:25.500
By the way.
Carl's birthday is tomorrow. sir.

1284
01:20:26.583 --> 01:20:27.833
Sixth April.

1285
01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:32.167
All the best. Mr… whatever your name is.

1286
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.458
[Zende] Not whatever. sir.

1287
01:20:34.458 --> 01:20:35.458
Inspector Zende.

1288
01:20:35.542 --> 01:20:36.583
[heroic music playing]

1289
01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:41.917
Inspector Madhukar Bapurao Zende.

1290
01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:46.958
[ominous music playing]

1291
01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.000
Sir. if you like. I could keep
a few men here.

1292
01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.375
Stop being ridiculous!

1293
01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:52.625
But sir. if what he says
turns out to be true…

1294
01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:54.583
He is just an ordinary inspector.

1295
01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:56.250
Just a small-time cop.

1296
01:20:57.667 --> 01:20:59.458
Carl will never come here.

1297
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:01.042
Okay. sir.

1298
01:21:16.917 --> 01:21:18.917
[comical music playing]

1299
01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:49.042
[crowd cheering]

1300
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.500
- [stammering] Sir?
- What happened?

1301
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.167
[sighs] We only have 87 rupees left.

1302
01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:32.917
On top of that.
we still have to pay the hotel bill.

1303
01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.083
[mutters]

1304
01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:43.375
Here.

1305
01:22:46.792 --> 01:22:48.625
Sir. from your own pocket?

1306
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.500
This is my mission.

1307
01:22:51.458 --> 01:22:52.667
Ten from me.

1308
01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:55.417
I have 12.

1309
01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:58.042
That's five from me.

1310
01:23:00.167 --> 01:23:01.250
[sighs]

1311
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:11.625
Sir. I have only two rupees.

1312
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.042
We're not leaving
before we get this scumbag.

1313
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.458
- Hmm?
- Yes. sir.

1314
01:23:22.667 --> 01:23:24.625
Sir. when I go back to Mumbai.

1315
01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.458
I will tell everyone in the department

1316
01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:29.000
that…

1317
01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:34.917
Sir. Don't turn your head
immediately. okay.

1318
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
- but I think that's...
- Yeah. Fonseca?

1319
01:23:38.375 --> 01:23:41.417
Mate. I know.
He has been stalking us all day.

1320
01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:44.917
He reads the morning paper at night.

1321
01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:49.833
[all laughing]

1322
01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:53.417
Jacob. don't laugh today.

1323
01:23:54.667 --> 01:23:55.792
I am laughing. sir.

1324
01:23:55.875 --> 01:23:58.500
[all laughing]

1325
01:23:58.583 --> 01:23:59.583
Hey. Fonseca!

1326
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.500
[laughing continues]

1327
01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:06.583
Hey. someone tickle the fella.
Then we'll see him laughing.

1328
01:24:10.792 --> 01:24:11.792
[Zende] <i>Jacob.</i>

1329
01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:14.643
- Hey. hey. no. you can smoke.
- No. no sir. It is okay.

1330
01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:15.747
- You dropped it.
- It's okay.

1331
01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:18.292
Well. never mind. It is a bad habit.

1332
01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:19.875
Okay. listen.

1333
01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:23.292
- If Carl wants to get out of this country…
- Mmm.

1334
01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:25.393
…he has no choice
but to go through Mumbai.

1335
01:24:25.417 --> 01:24:27.958
- Mmm.
- There is no international airport in Goa.

1336
01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:29.458
Mmm.

1337
01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:32.708
So then why is that asshole
still here in Goa?

1338
01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:36.750
[Jacob] Yes. sir.
And now he has a passport as well.

1339
01:24:37.375 --> 01:24:38.500
[Zende] Mmm.

1340
01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:40.333
There's a place we need to see.

1341
01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.875
[tense music playing]

1342
01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:48.167
[officer] She leaves tomorrow.

1343
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.542
From here to Egypt.
and from there to New York. America.

1344
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.292
Sir. that rat will make his escape
on this ship tomorrow.

1345
01:24:59.375 --> 01:25:01.375
Let's have the team in place
by early morning.

1346
01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:04.625
The port area is too big. Jacob.

1347
01:25:05.542 --> 01:25:06.750
And we have very few men.

1348
01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:09.583
We will come here.

1349
01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:14.583
but we can't take our eyes off
O'Coqueiro tonight.

1350
01:25:14.667 --> 01:25:15.667
[Jacob] Sir.

1351
01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:20.042
[tense music continues]

1352
01:25:23.708 --> 01:25:24.792
Name?

1353
01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.000
John Miller.

1354
01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.292
- [Home Minister] <i>Purandhare?</i>
- <i>Jai Hind.</i> sir.

1355
01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:35.292
Purandhare. are some people
from your department in Goa right now?

1356
01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:36.917
Not that I know of. sir.

1357
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.750
Some men from the Mumbai Police
met ACP Vyas in Goa yesterday.

1358
01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:43.000
They were talking about Carl.

1359
01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:45.667
Must be one of our officers
on holiday. sir.

1360
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:47.542
