1
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.610
Please. pay attention!

2
00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.739
I need you to put your cell phones.
beepers. and radios in the container.

3
00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.657
Is this necessary. Agent Pena?

4
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.244
I'm afraid so. Captain.
Please. I'll take that.

5
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.039
One of my guys says one of your guys

6
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.332
is working for the cartel.

7
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.211
They have any proof?

8
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:27.712
Can't say yet.

9
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.591
But this warrant will be hard to execute
if they're one step ahead.

10
00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.054
It's just a precaution.

11
00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.058
Gracias.
Okay.

12
00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:44.145
For the next three hours.
we'll be running silent.

13
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.525
My colleagues and I will take the lead.
And the target?

14
00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.612
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

15
00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.536
We're advisors.
We work together. same as always.

16
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.372
Credit's all yours.

17
00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:12.132
Gentlemen. you heard!
I need you to be tight and right.

18
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.134
Understood?
Yes. sir!

19
00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.176
Let's go.

20
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.362
In case you're confused. Capiti�n.

21
00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.532
I wouldn't have come all the way
from Bogoti�if it wasn't a big deal.

22
00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:42.537
My men's safety.
That's what I care about.

23
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.999
I make the final call
if anything feels off.

24
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.126
You follow?

25
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.094
My kid gave it to me right before
I went out on this buy-bust.

26
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.181
Some Jamaican took a rip at me.
missed by that much. so...

27
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.893
I rub it for luck ever since.

28
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.634
So. what are we doing here?

29
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.680
We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

30
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.136
Applauded
by the multitude present on 10th street.

31
00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:51.184
president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano
is welcomed by the people of Colombia...

32
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.562
I don't give
Gilberto Rodriguez credit for much.

33
00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:56.314
but I have to hand it to him...

34
00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.193
he was a man in control.

35
00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.403
It's too early.

36
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:08.117
I rise early. I'm up with the sun.
Up all right!

37
00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.121
He was married to three women.

38
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:13.956
At the same time.

39
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.710
And he managed them the same way
he ran his business.

40
00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:20.713
Scheduled down to the minute.

41
00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.847
Wife number three got him
Monday and Tuesday.

42
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:30.932
Hi!

43
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:33.726
How did it go. honey?

44
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.646
Very good! Look. what a beauty.

45
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.900
Number two...

46
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.113
got him Wednesday and Thursday.

47
00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.619
And wife number one
got him on Friday and Saturday.

48
00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:52.995
Look at that pass. Goal!

49
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.873
Damn it. what sort of defense is that?
Piece of shit!

50
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.375
I'm paying your fucking salaries!

51
00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.418
Sundays were for football.

52
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.922
All the wives were invited
if they wanted to come.

53
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.590
They usually did.

54
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.008
Thank you.

55
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.385
And they all got along.

56
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.220
That was the deal.

57
00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:12.432
And he made it work. He insisted on it.

58
00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.601
He made far more friends than enemies.

59
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.020
I can help you expand your businesses...

60
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.356
And he would count on those friends
to protect him.

61
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.608
I could help you make millions.

62
00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.902
His retirement was going to go his way.
too.

63
00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.739
He wasn't going to die
on some shitty rooftop.

64
00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.868
Nobody was stabbing him in the back.
nobody forcing him out.

65
00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.289
Like I said. he was a man in control.

66
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.041
The guy who never made
a wrong move in his life.

67
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.462
A guy who built a billion-dollar empire.
brick by brick.

68
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.131
A guy who owned every cop in town.

69
00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:49.552
A guy with a get-out-of-jail-free card
burning a hole in his pocket.

70
00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.346
And you want to go after him? Shit.

71
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.560
You'd have to be crazy. stupid. brave.
and lucky all at the same time.

72
00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.146
Two units: Calderon's and mine.

73
00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.483
Breach one here. Breach two... here.

74
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.695
Feistl. Van Ness: pool.
You come in from the back.

75
00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:12.408
All right. let's do this already.
Okay.

76
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.496
If anyone kills the godfather.
I kill you.

77
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.541
We can't repeat what happened
with Escobar. I want him alive.

78
00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.668
Understood?

79
00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:52.907
Go.

80
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:26.065
Nobody lives here. boss.
That's bullshit.

81
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:28.067
Intel had Pacho here last night.

82
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.239
What do you think? What do we do?

83
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:36.033
I think there could be hideouts here.

84
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.828
We have to check the house again.
All right.

85
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.871
We turn this place upside down.

86
00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:45.626
Men. we're going to search
every corner of this house. understood?

87
00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.677
It's an elegant house in Palmira. boss.

88
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.221
I don't know whose it is.
but it's not one of ours.

89
00:09:57.305 --> 00:10:01.726
Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

90
00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:03.352
Yes. sir.

91
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.026
Salcedo.
Jorge.

92
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:11.819
Sir.

93
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.991
I need you to do something important.

94
00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.994
When you leave your house.
you'll find Navegante.

95
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:21.829
He knows where you have to go.

96
00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:27.084
Of course. sir. but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

97
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.547
Cordova. Give it to Cordova.

98
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:33.549
Jorge...

99
00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.094
be careful.
Of course. sir.

100
00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:50.191
He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

101
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.697
You're a man of your word.

102
00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:32.608
Jui�rez.

103
00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:37.446
So close to heaven and so far from God.

104
00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:40.366
Impressive.

105
00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:45.162
I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

106
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.751
Don't be an asshole. Pacho.

107
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:54.755
El Paso. Texas.
is what I wanted you to see.

108
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.466
Fucking NAFTA changed everything. Pacho.

109
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.429
It's been around for what?
Two years. more or less?

110
00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:05.766
More than two million trucks
have crossed already. many of them ours.

111
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.309
Filled to the brim.

112
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.563
Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

113
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:15.317
Less than ten percent. It's insane.
They don't have the manpower.

114
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.486
Assholes opened the floodgates

115
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.490
and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it.

116
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.537
This is the right business.
I already know this. man.

117
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.372
No. man. What I'm saying is.

118
00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:32.543
you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

119
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:34.462
And you're going to regret it.

120
00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:37.756
You want some?

121
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:46.265
Amado. are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

122
00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:51.145
No. No way. Why betray?
They want to get out.

123
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:56.108
I'm proposing that we start
something new. you and I.

124
00:12:57.109 --> 00:13:00.571
Just imagine it:
You send it to me. I get it across.

125
00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:05.034
In two years. we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

126
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.788
Think about it. all right?
Think about it.

127
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.791
Just don't take too long.
because in six months.

128
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.418
I need to secure a new supply.

129
00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.881
Hopefully. it will be with you.

130
00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:30.643
Hey...

131
00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:32.394
Give it another once-over?

132
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.439
Okay.

133
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.072
It should be now.

134
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.799
Thirty seconds.

135
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.098
Hey!

136
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.059
Hey! You can't park there!

137
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:14.687
Damn truck.

138
00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.815
These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

139
00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:18.857
You can't park here.

140
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:20.943
Let me just grab the cables
and I'll move it.

141
00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.194
Move the fucking truck.

142
00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.081
That's the one Lady Di uses.

143
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:35.291
Gilberto!

144
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.919
Someone's ringing the doorbell!

145
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:44.174
Careful.
Sorry. wait just a moment.

146
00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:46.844
Let me get the door.

147
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.220
Look.

148
00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:54.143
Gilberto?

149
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:03.152
Police! Back up. Quickly! Move it!

150
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.403
Quickly! Move it!

151
00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:06.447
What's going on?

152
00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.033
Sit down. ladies.
Sit down. I won't say it again.

153
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.371
You can't come in here. Get out.

154
00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.631
He's fucking running!

155
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.151
Get up! Look at my face!

156
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:46.904
Let's go.

157
00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:50.991
Sit down. miss.
I already told you. Gilberto is not home.

158
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:52.618
Did he contact anyone?

159
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.329
No one. Colonel.
No? All good?

160
00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:59.833
Mrs. Rodriguez. I have a federal
warrant signed and executed by myself.

161
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.920
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

162
00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:08.384
The question is. will you cooperate?

163
00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:40.207
Are you all right?

164
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:42.751
Yes.

165
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:47.506
It's good here.

166
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.726
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

167
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.981
Yeah. Okay. We're done. I'm calling it.

168
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.028
I'm sorry. I thought we had something.

169
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.196
Welcome to my world.

170
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:13.907
Well...

171
00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.869
Do what you need to wrap up.
have your men report back.

172
00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:18.454
Okay.
Feistl. anything else?

173
00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:21.331
Ride to the airport?
Sure.

174
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.262
Look. when we get there.
I think it's better if I go in alone.

175
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.723
These people are angry.

176
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:43.562
What we're asking of them.
it's an insult on top of their grief.

177
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:48.150
You're different. Jorge Salcedo.

178
00:17:51.111 --> 00:17:52.529
Different? How?

179
00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:56.909
You're crippled. You don't carry a gun.

180
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.289
Most people don't carry guns.

181
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.753
Yeah... but you're not most people.

182
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:12.132
And that's why it's so weird.
Interesting.

183
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.802
That you never carry a gun.

184
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.599
I see. Why do you think that is?

185
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.351
I don't know.

186
00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:24.812
Maybe you're scared.

187
00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.987
Fear... of what you could do with it.

188
00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:39.159
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

189
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.182
Pedrito. go in the house!

190
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.897
Good afternoon. Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down. Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

191
00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:14.027
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you. if I could.

192
00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:17.614
Go right back to where you came from

193
00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:21.577
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson.

194
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.079
she can come looking for him.

195
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.789
I just came to talk.

196
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.208
If you don't like what I have to say.

197
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:30.377
I'll go to Cali
and deliver whatever message you want.

198
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.546
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

199
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:38.760
Your boss murdered my son...
to take up with his whore wife.

200
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:43.891
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

201
00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:47.519
I know this is not what you want
to hear. But she is his mother.

202
00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:50.314
And Miguel Rodriguez is protecting her.

203
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:52.566
Protecting?

204
00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.819
Is that what they call it now?

205
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.780
And he will be protected as well.

206
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:03.869
And if you let me take him back. I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

207
00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:07.664
You promise. How nice of you.

208
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.460
Who told you I would do that?

209
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:16.256
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

210
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.550
That bitch made her choice.

211
00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:23.597
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

212
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:28.227
The next men who come...
won't be asking.

213
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.603
There will be war.

214
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.819
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

215
00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:45.035
If you don't mind. Capiti�n.
we need to stop by a friend's house.

216
00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:48.956
Make a right here.

217
00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.922
Nice neighborhood.
Your friend's very wealthy.

218
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.259
He's a very fortunate man.

219
00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:10.185
What is this?

220
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.147
My friend likes chickens.

221
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:23.323
Colonel Marti�nez.
Captain.

222
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.118
You know what's happening here?

223
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.078
Yes. I think I know.

224
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:30.163
I'm giving you one chance

225
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:34.167
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

226
00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.467
You think you're clever?

227
00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:46.888
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogoti�.

228
00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:49.683
You're way out of line here. Hugo.

229
00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:52.894
Perhaps.

230
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.034
He's here. We'll find him.

231
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:11.955
Watch him.

232
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.001
You got your kid's drawing?

233
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.048
I'm unarmed.

234
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:23.759
We're going to send your head
back to Miguel in a fucking box.

235
00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:27.095
Walk. motherfucker.
Let's go.

236
00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:28.847
Duvan!

237
00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:30.766
Duvan!

238
00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:34.853
Bring out the car.

239
00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:39.232
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

240
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.820
Very good.
Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

241
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.659
All right. my lady.
Make like a statue or I shoot your ass.

242
00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:51.745
I'm getting in first. you hear?

243
00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:53.997
Real still.

244
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:57.501
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want?

245
00:22:57.584 --> 00:22:58.585
Relax.

246
00:22:58.668 --> 00:23:00.712
Stop!
Mama!

247
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.130
What else. motherfucker?

248
00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:06.635
Fucking asshole!

249
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.707
Fuck!

250
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:44.399
Drop the weapon.

251
00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:52.240
Drop the weapon.

252
00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:58.205
Don't shoot.

253
00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:00.957
I'm a man of peace.

254
00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:21.394
Let's go.

255
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.205
Hey! Stop!

256
00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:25.333
Colonel! Calderon took off.

257
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.627
Fuck. We move fast.
Okay.

258
00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.092
You have a phone in there?
Yes. in there.

259
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.354
They got Gilberto.
they're moving towards the aerial base.

260
00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.273
The whole workforce is on this.

261
00:26:49.357 --> 00:26:53.737
They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?

262
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.923
Move it. asshole.

263
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:24.142
They'll try to take us on the road.

264
00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:25.894
Guns out!

265
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:32.067
Cleaning. cooking. working.

266
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:35.820
Hello.

267
00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:39.366
Don Miguel... something's happened.

268
00:27:39.616 --> 00:27:40.450
What happened?

269
00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:45.705
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

270
00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:20.573
We've got a visual.

271
00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:25.078
Surround him in the market!

272
00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:37.841
Tail him!

273
00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:49.561
Look! There he goes! Faster!

274
00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:53.148
Let's get him on the next turn!

275
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:01.364
Hold your fire!

276
00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:09.873
Driver!
Put your hands where I can see them!

277
00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:12.500
Driver!

278
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:16.337
Out further!

279
00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:18.631
Further!

280
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.808
Get out.

281
00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:30.769
Open the back.

282
00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:33.104
Okay. Let me get the keys.
Open it.

283
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:48.661
Open it.

284
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:50.288
Okay. All right. Settle.

285
00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:04.969
The American sons of bitches tricked us.
We've got the wrong truck!

286
00:30:06.012 --> 00:30:07.847
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

287
00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.850
I took care of security.

288
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:15.438
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

289
00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:18.858
Send Salcedo's beeper another message.

290
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.961
Uncle! It's me. Nicolas!

291
00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:42.590
Come in.

292
00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:46.845
Nicolas.
Uncle.

293
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:54.394
Is it true?
Yes.

294
00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:57.438
They got him.

295
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.150
Nicolas.
why don't you go home and wait there?

296
00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:03.444
Once something happens. I'll call you.

297
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.196
No. sir. I have to help.

298
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:08.533
Come.

299
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.370
You know your dad
doesn't want you mixed up in this.

300
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.499
We have to have faith that your dad
won't be taken out of Cali.

301
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:17.417
And if he is?

302
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.838
Why did we waste all of that money
on my education? I'm a lawyer.

303
00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:23.923
I'm taking the first flight to Bogoti�.

304
00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.425
I want to help him.

305
00:31:26.467 --> 00:31:28.720
Let's hope that's not necessary.

306
00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:27.946
Fuck.

307
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:29.989
Wait here.

308
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.248
What's up? Why'd we stop?

309
00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:41.084
There's cops surrounding the plane.

310
00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:44.337
Cops? Good ones?

311
00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:46.965
I don't think so.

312
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.134
Colonel Marti�nez.

313
00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:52.929
Sir. please don't come any closer.

314
00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:57.600
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

315
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.395
You know it.

316
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.438
And that means prison.

317
00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.153
What you do today...

318
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:12.323
what you do this moment...

319
00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:14.659
defines you.

320
00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:16.995
For the rest of your lives.

321
00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.168
Are you police or not?

322
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.263
That's better.

323
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.180
Home stretch.

324
00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:41.579
Shit!

325
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.043
What's up? It's me.

326
00:34:47.376 --> 00:34:50.171
About fucking time.
I was out of range.

327
00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.923
They arrested Gilberto.

328
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.551
What?
They got him. Jorge.

329
00:34:56.052 --> 00:34:57.470
They got Gilberto.

330
00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:03.643
You were monitoring the raid.
But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.

331
00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:07.563
Even so. we checked all the tapes.
It's impossible.

332
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.109
It doesn't make sense!

333
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.903
I just don't understand!

334
00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:18.699
Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

335
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:20.660
We got beat.

336
00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.787
Get back here quick.

337
00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:31.879
Hasta la vista. baby. Ciao.

338
00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:47.520
Take that.

339
00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.533
Five seconds to take photos. no more.

340
00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:01.868
Congratulations.

341
00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:04.912
But you know this won't hold up.

342
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:08.916
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

343
00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:14.881
Smile. Gilberto.
You're about to be on TV.

344
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.385
This way. Mr. Rodriguez.

345
00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:22.471
Mr. Rodriguez. do you have a response
to the charges against you?

346
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:25.266
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

347
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:26.517
Enough. Let's go.

348
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:30.188
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodriguez.

349
00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:40.323
For those of us
who thought the surrender was bullshit.

350
00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:43.784
Gilberto's arrest proved
that these guys could be caught.

351
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.247
For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid violence.

352
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:50.166
it was the beginning of a nightmare.

353
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:53.920
The first shot in a war
to bring down another cartel.

354
00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:58.382
But whatever side you fell on.
one thing was clear:

355
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.970
Gilberto Rodriguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

356
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.390
Especially him.

357
00:37:22.698 --> 00:37:23.741
Don Gilberto.

358
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.214
Hey. congrats.

359
00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:40.049
Congratulations. Good work.

360
00:37:40.716 --> 00:37:43.261
No. where you going?
Come on. we want to toast you!

361
00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:44.679
Start without me.

362
00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:45.846
Great work!

363
00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:53.271
Mr. Ambassador.
Big day.

364
00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:57.775
Quite a notch on your belt.
It was strong intel. sir.

365
00:37:57.858 --> 00:37:59.652
I acted...
Know how much work you torched?

366
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:01.570
People want to see
the godfathers in handcuffs

367
00:38:01.654 --> 00:38:03.197
and that's what they're gonna get.

368
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:07.118
Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
Colombians may not feel that way.

369
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.579
Let's go find out.

370
00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:13.249
Get changed.

371
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.303
My love!
Mommy!

372
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.765
Mommy.

373
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:32.101
Are you hungry? No?
No.

374
00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:37.023
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

375
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.321
Come on.
Mom will read you a story in a bit.

376
00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:44.822
Go. I'll be right there.

377
00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:47.992
Thanks for showing up. Jorge.

378
00:38:53.956 --> 00:38:56.292
Sir.
we don't know how much the DEA knows.

379
00:38:56.625 --> 00:39:00.546
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

380
00:39:03.132 --> 00:39:04.633
I'll stay here for now.

381
00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:10.890
We all need to talk.

382
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:19.899
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorizes the police...

383
00:39:19.982 --> 00:39:23.861
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

384
00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:27.615
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

385
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.033
of the United States.

386
00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:31.994
The takedown. Mr. Attorney General.
was National Police.

387
00:39:32.578 --> 00:39:36.665
The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

388
00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:39.210
So a war started by National Police?

389
00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:41.545
Look. as Attorney General.

390
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:47.134
my main... concern is achieving a
peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

391
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.762
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela

392
00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:53.682
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

393
00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:57.895
The President of Colombia.
Ernesto Samper.

394
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.985
I hate to be late to a good debate.

395
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:08.989
You know us. might as well
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.

396
00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:13.869
I've been apprised by Minister Botero

397
00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:16.622
about our newly-incarcerated
Cali godfather.

398
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:21.210
With all due respect. Mr. President?
Go ahead. Miguel.

399
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:26.132
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

400
00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:30.428
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela.

401
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.266
Colombia is a nation of laws.

402
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:37.726
Not of concessions.

403
00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.814
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organization in the world...

404
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:45.526
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

405
00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.614
Mr. Rodriguez is entitled
to the same due process

406
00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:52.783
as any Colombian citizen.

407
00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:56.287
Let's see where due process gets him.

408
00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.249
For now...

409
00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:03.586
his arrest stands.

410
00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:06.088
Thank you. gentlemen.

411
00:41:08.924 --> 00:41:10.092
Fuckin' A.

412
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:27.026
Thank you very much.

413
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:03.604
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

414
00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.730
Relax. Dad.

415
00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:08.400
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

416
00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:16.825
Besides.
I thought you could use a friendly face.

417
00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:22.373
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

418
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.505
How's it look?

419
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.342
The warrants are old.

420
00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:37.179
Invalid?
Vulnerable.

421
00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:42.101
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

422
00:42:42.184 --> 00:42:44.228
8:00 a.m.. latest. I'm out.

423
00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:48.148
Dad. you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

424
00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:53.153
And he'll hold you here in Bogoti�
due to the conspiracy charge.

425
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:56.115
I don't get it.

426
00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:58.826
This is a mistake. a blunder.

427
00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:02.538
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

428
00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:04.873
That's what you want to believe.

429
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.334
But if that was the case.
you'd be out by now.

430
00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:13.424
Dad. this is real.
No. money is real.

431
00:43:13.507 --> 00:43:15.426
And what about all I've paid?

432
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.513
Sons of bitches
can't leave me confined here.

433
00:43:23.517 --> 00:43:26.478
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that. gentlemen?

434
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:28.564
It was Calderon.

435
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:33.360
Dad. I say we tear him to pieces.

436
00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:36.947
And his fucking family and his children.
David. please.

437
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.660
Obviously.
there's responsibility on all sides.

438
00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:45.998
Cordova...
Sir. just as we realized...

439
00:43:46.081 --> 00:43:47.458
By the time you realized.

440
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:53.088
Colonel Marti�nez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

441
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.758
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

442
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:58.469
When it comes to the DEA.
Cordova counts on me.

443
00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:05.267
Wait. Cordova. you're my brother's
personal head of security.

444
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:07.728
Yes. sir.

445
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.648
Then you should've been there.

446
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.402
Your men should've been there.

447
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:21.659
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck.

448
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.162
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

449
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:31.293
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us are safe.

450
00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:33.379
Not your families...

451
00:44:37.883 --> 00:44:38.842
and not mine.

452
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:41.261
My family.

453
00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:50.604
Thank you. Attorney General Valdivieso.
Defense Minister Botero.

454
00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:54.775
Today marks an important beginning.

455
00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.193
an important victory.

456
00:44:57.444 --> 00:45:00.572
Because of the success
of our Colombian-American operation...

457
00:45:01.156 --> 00:45:02.991
the Cali cartel is on the run.

458
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.954
And with the continued support
of the Colombian National Police...

459
00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:12.668
I promise you...
the other three godfathers will fall.

460
00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:16.255
Questions?

461
00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:19.967
That's as much recognition
as we can hope for. right?

462
00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:27.057
None at all? Smart move.

463
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.560
Keep his face all over this
while we're closing in.

464
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:32.396
Kiss-ass.

465
00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:36.191
Want some?

466
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:38.986
No. I'm moving tables.

467
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.279
Oh. boy.

468
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:42.906
Oh. God.

469
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.159
Can't believe you're eating that shit.

470
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.233
Colonel. please.

471
00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:20.110
Thanks.

472
00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:23.030
Have a drink with me.

473
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:28.827
Tonight. we celebrate.

474
00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:32.080
Tomorrow. we go back to work.

475
00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:36.793
Well. not for me.

476
00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.881
What are you talking about?

477
00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.926
You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

478
00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:46.970
Yeah. we never saw those.

479
00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:50.390
Apparently. Vargas did.

480
00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:54.853
And there was a list of cops
who've been accepting money from Cali.

481
00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:59.358
One name he was eager to share: mine.

482
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.780
Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

483
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:09.117
Exactly. It sends a message to any cop
who wants to try what we did.

484
00:47:18.418 --> 00:47:20.837
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

485
00:47:24.132 --> 00:47:25.217
Good luck.

486
00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:27.636
Colonel...

487
00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:31.723
I'm sorry.

488
00:47:38.772 --> 00:47:43.026
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

489
00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:47.447
You did everything right. Pena.

490
00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:51.201
But now you're all alone.

491
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:55.372
Take care.

492
00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:25.193
We need to talk about your security.

493
00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:28.905
Let me be in charge.

494
00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:32.200
I'll protect you. Dad.

495
00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:38.165
Now's not the time for a change.

496
00:48:43.837 --> 00:48:47.090
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

497
00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:53.555
What if he doesn't come back?

498
00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:09.488
Jorge.

499
00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:11.782
Jorge.

500
00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:31.385
They got Gilberto.
I don't understand.

501
00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:34.221
I thought Gilberto
had this all under control.

502
00:49:34.596 --> 00:49:35.764
So did I.

503
00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:38.975
And what now?

504
00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:40.977
This could get messy.

505
00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:45.148
Stay where you are.
Right now. we look out for ourselves.

506
00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:49.361
Pacho... be smart.

507
00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.906
For now. we wait.

508
00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:55.575
You stay there a while longer.

509
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:58.745
We have to keep everything running.

510
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:04.960
The health of the business has never
been more important. Understand?

511
00:50:06.044 --> 00:50:07.129
Yes. Of course.

512
00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:12.426
You listening to me. motherfucker?

513
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:16.388
Hey. listen. buddy.
I don't speak Spanish.

514
00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:19.516
No speak Spanish.

515
00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:21.935
Okay.

516
00:50:22.769 --> 00:50:24.020
Have a nice day.

517
00:50:54.968 --> 00:50:57.554
Hey. boss. Good day today. huh?

518
00:50:57.637 --> 00:50:58.889
The Jurado tapes.

519
00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:03.185
Well. we probably shouldn't call them
that because they're not legal. per se.

520
00:51:03.268 --> 00:51:04.478
I want all of them.
