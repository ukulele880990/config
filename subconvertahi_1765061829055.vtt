2
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:11.363
Bren! Breakfast!

3
00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:14.408
Good morning. Mother.

4
00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.078
Where is Father?

5
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.749
Boars ruined the fence again.

6
00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.418
I will go and fetch him.

7
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.338
Before your delicious porridge gets cold.

8
00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.424
Oh. come on!

9
00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:31.884
Thank you. little spark.

10
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:42.353
Left. left!

11
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.151
Here. let me help.

12
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.698
No offense. kid. but I don't think
you can do any better.

13
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.285
Son? You have something up your sleeve?

14
00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:01.997
Pockets. actually.

15
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.670
Now keep it steady.

16
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:21.559
Well done. boy.

17
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.018
Sorcery!

18
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:27.273
No-- well. yes. Sort of.

19
00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:33.320
Your father said you could do magic--
but I figured he meant card tricks...

20
00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:36.073
A common misunderstanding.

21
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:38.242
Magic is nothing more than a tool.

22
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.494
Like a hoe or a hammer.

23
00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:46.709
Amazing what this one can do with
talent and some old books.

24
00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.591
Wow. that's a fancy ride.

25
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.343
What is the Empire doing way out here?

26
00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.245
Shake his hand.

27
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:38.010
I heard there was a farmer's son
in the Zemni Fields

28
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.387
who had a gift for magic.

29
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:45.809
This transmutation spell... it shows a
high level of refinement.

30
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.937
He's not in trouble then?

31
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:53.734
No. no. Quite the opposite.

32
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.494
It's been quite a while since I've had a
home-cooked meal.

33
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.622
Your doing. I presume?

34
00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:08.916
It was an accident.

35
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.668
Arcane Fire.

36
00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:14.964
Sadly. your brick never stood a chance.

37
00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.592
Arcane Fire burns hotter
than natural flames.

38
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:22.972
To summon such a spell
with no instruction--

39
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.974
that's exemplary. Bren.

40
00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:27.267
It was just in a book. sir.

41
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.270
Anyone can read the words.

42
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:31.647
But to understand it...

43
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.110
I believe you would thrive
at the Soltryce Academy.

44
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.946
I appreciate that. sir.

45
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.156
But my hands are needed here.

46
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.660
We've discussed it.

47
00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.453
The tuition is...

48
00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.706
We could take some livestock to market.

49
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.540
Darling.

50
00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.669
We'd never want to hold Bren back
from serving the Empire.

51
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.379
I see.

52
00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:59.883
I'm certain Bren's talent will
secure him a scholarship.

53
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.180
And if he graduates. he'll earn more than
enough to hire help for the farm.

54
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.268
Ow! You stupid--

55
00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:11.437
Frumpkin! No!

56
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.606
I am sorry. sir.
He's never done that before.

57
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.900
It's quite alright.

58
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.114
See?

59
00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.407
All better.

60
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:32.916
In my hand is an acceptance
letter to the Academy.

61
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.335
The parchment is enchanted

62
00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.049
so that when it burns. the letter
will appear in the Admissions Office.

63
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:43.218
Consider this your entrance exam.

64
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:46.638
Bren means 'fire' in the old tongue. yes?

65
00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:50.476
Let's see if you can live up to the name.

66
00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.667
You can do this. lad.

67
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.189
Bren Aldric Ermendrud.

68
00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:39.775
Welcome to the Soltryce Academy.

69
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:42.736
And to the rest of your life.

70
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.739
- Bren. how wonderful.
- My boy!

71
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.812
Now you can no longer hide.

72
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.250
You've got big balls showing up late.

73
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.299
You can do this.

74
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:48.845
You know how easy it would be for us
to kill her. together.

75
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.999
You have lost her trust Bren. The others
will soon follow.

76
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:48.250
Silence.

77
00:27:57.093 --> 00:28:00.971
The monk will snap your neck when she
finds out the truth.

78
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:02.431
Shut your mouth!

79
00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:10.106
Kill her. while you still can.

80
00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.068
Just tell her.

81
00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:16.320
You are still Volstrucker.

82
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.002
You are a killer. Follow your
instincts. Kill her. then come home.

83
00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:44.463
Father still loves you.
