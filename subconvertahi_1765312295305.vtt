No. no. Carrillo's solid.

Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

13
00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:35.204
Did you drop your wallet?

Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

24
00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.688
You probably got a price on your head.
but no one's gonna take the contract.

Fucking price on my head?

26

There's a standing bounty

The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

29
00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:17.955
was Kiki Camarena. a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

30
00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:20.333
Kiki was captured and tortured.

34
00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:33.471
They could kill an American

I won't.

- Why?

to political success were there...

90
00:06:30.643 --> 00:06:34.605

to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

91
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.656
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist

Look. I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

102
00:07:17.606 --> 00:07:19.775
And for that reason.
I think that...

103
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.111
Well. I think that
I understand the people

104
00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:25.405
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

105
00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:30.077
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say. Mr. Escobar.

106
00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:34.289
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

how much I am going to donate?

- No. no--
- Look. I am not a politician.

I come from the street... brother.

I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

112
00:07:54.518 --> 00:07:56.854
- It's not about that--
- Assuming your piece is ten percent.

113
00:07:56.937 --> 00:07:58.397
your piece would be what?

114
00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.941
$300.000 just for you.

115
00:08:05.362 --> 00:08:08.281
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

116
00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:10.784
- Most definitely.
- All right. then.

He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

127
00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:45.819
The people love him.
and he loves the people.

128
00:08:45.903 --> 00:08:48.614
And from a legal point of view.
his money is clean.

129
00:08:48.697 --> 00:08:52.409
And according to Forbes Magazine.
he's a drug trafficker.

130

In addition.
this man has no criminal record.

there would be proof of his background.

to contribute millions of dollars.

so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

a little while until things quiet down?

152

Oh. you're gonna make them quiet down?
You're that good. huh? [scoffs]

153
00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:16.952
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back. too.

We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

170
00:11:18.388 --> 00:11:22.059
That's because you don't know

00:11:25.187 --> 00:11:28.023
Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.

173
00:11:28.107 --> 00:11:29.900
[speaking Spanish]
Who is the gringa?

174
00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:31.610
A child of God. just like you.

175
00:11:31.693 --> 00:11:33.486
Hm. Got it.

176
00:11:33.653 --> 00:11:36.698
- [up-tempo music playing]
- [men cheering nearby]

177
00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:43.538
[speaking Spanish]
Let's see. you are here for a cat?

178
00:11:43.705 --> 00:11:47.126
This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

179
00:11:47.293 --> 00:11:49.836
- [in English] What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

180
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.506
[in Spanish] And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

181
00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:57.886
It was the narcos. Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

182
00:11:59.554 --> 00:12:01.056
Your friend is a little crazy.

183
00:12:01.223 --> 00:12:03.475
No hablo español. [in English]
I don't know what you're saying.

184
00:12:03.642 --> 00:12:04.935
[in Spanish]
I don't speak English.

185
00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:09.439
Get me some information. Suárez.

186
00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:11.317
[Suárez]
Look. I don't have enough people

187
00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:15.403
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a fucking cat.

188
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.199
If this was information about the narcos.
yes. my people are interested.

189
00:12:19.283 --> 00:12:20.993
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.

190
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.829
- [in English] What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

191
00:12:23.912 --> 00:12:25.247
Tell me about it.

192
00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:28.834
[in Spanish] But if you want
to put all my people to work

193
00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:33.630
to find out who killed the fucking cat.
that is going to cost you more.

194
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.759
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

195
00:12:38.635 --> 00:12:41.429
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

196
00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:42.722
Find out.

197
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.270
- [in English] Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

198
00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:51.148
[Steve] Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information.

199
00:12:51.315 --> 00:12:54.776
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

200
00:12:54.943 --> 00:12:59.781
[in Spanish] This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country.

201
00:12:59.865 --> 00:13:03.952
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

202
00:13:04.786 --> 00:13:06.246
That's not true.

203
00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:09.791
These guys killed his cat.

204
00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:13.045
Maybe you don't know this.
but the mistreatment of animals

205
00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:14.462
is a federal crime.

206
00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:17.090
Is this funny to you?

207
00:13:17.966 --> 00:13:22.470
They can bring formal charges against you.
and you could lose your job.

208
00:13:22.554 --> 00:13:25.349
Do you not need your job. Santiago?

209
00:13:26.474 --> 00:13:27.600
Yes. I need it.

210
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.906
Mr. Murphy.
do you recognize these men?

211
00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:43.742
[in English] Yeah. you guys
stalled me at the airport

212
00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:47.413
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it. didn't you?

213
00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:49.581
- [in Spanish] What?
- May I?

214
00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:54.044
You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent

215
00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:55.712
of the United States.

216
00:13:56.504 --> 00:14:00.508
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

217
00:14:00.592 --> 00:14:03.470
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

218
00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:08.141
This is absurd.

219
00:14:09.476 --> 00:14:13.272
Look. I'm a Colombian citizen.
and I know exactly my--

220
00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:16.524
You will not disrespect them!

221
00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:19.319
[softly]
Is that clear?

222
00:14:19.486 --> 00:14:25.158
If I open my mouth. they kill me...
and they kill my wife.

223
00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:27.660
He's having problems with his wife.

224
00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:28.912
Shut up!

225
00:14:29.913 --> 00:14:31.873
- [mutters] Imbecile.
- OK. gentlemen.

226
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:34.376
This is quite simple.

227
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:41.800
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents.

228
00:14:41.967 --> 00:14:46.554
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

229
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.140
How does that sound?

230
00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:56.356
I sent a copy of that passport...

231
00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:59.692
to a man they call...

232
00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:02.279
"Poison."

233
00:15:05.324 --> 00:15:07.200
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
OK. Poison.

234
00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:10.496
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

235
00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:12.372
And this is the address.

236
00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:14.791
If they stop you on the road.
just salute the official.

237
00:15:14.874 --> 00:15:17.336
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

238
00:15:18.128 --> 00:15:19.379
No violence.

239
00:15:19.463 --> 00:15:21.340
And you call me every two hours.

240
00:15:21.423 --> 00:15:23.758
- Of course. boss. Whatever you say.
- OK. then. No showing off.

241
00:15:23.925 --> 00:15:26.261
[shouts]
No showing off!

242
00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:30.474
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- [man] Got it.

243
00:15:30.682 --> 00:15:34.144
- [murmuring appreciatively]
- What the fuck are you doing?

244
00:15:35.645 --> 00:15:36.896
Getting ready. right?

245
00:15:37.063 --> 00:15:40.650
You are meeting up with politicians.
not with gangsters.

246
00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:44.779
Aren't they the same thing. boss?

247
00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:48.825
Politicians scare easily.

248
00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:50.827
You're fine with just a pistol.

249
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.455
Go to it. then.
Go to it. dumbass.

250
00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:57.625
[in English] According to CNP wiretaps.
the sicario "Poison"

251
00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:00.170
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

252
00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.838
For what purpose.
we don't know.

253
00:16:01.921 --> 00:16:04.799
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy.

254
00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:06.385
we're sending the wrong message.

255
00:16:06.468 --> 00:16:08.845
Police have the information.
then they should make the arrest.

256
00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:11.097
No. No. if we leave it to them.
someone will sell us out.

257
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.808
The narcos have informants
in their department.

258
00:16:13.975 --> 00:16:16.562
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

259
00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:18.397
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

260
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.690
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect. Ambassador.

261
00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:22.526
but you know where we are.

262
00:16:22.609 --> 00:16:24.361
With enough money.
you can get anything done.

263
00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:31.535
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock. is it?

264
00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:33.036
Well. if the roadblock is too obvious.

265
00:16:33.119 --> 00:16:36.456
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby. who knows.

266
00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:40.126
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

267
00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:43.088
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

268
00:16:43.171 --> 00:16:44.714
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

269
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:47.050
You're gonna question them. right?
Because we need to--

270
00:16:47.217 --> 00:16:48.594
Poison's killed three of my men already.

271
00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:50.678
If I catch him alive.
you guys can question him here.

272
00:16:51.638 --> 00:16:52.931
Then you guys gotta go.

273
00:17:00.146 --> 00:17:01.481
[up-tempo music plays on radio]

274
00:17:01.565 --> 00:17:03.442
[speaking Spanish]
Hey. hey. hey. hold on. 65?

275
00:17:03.609 --> 00:17:04.984
Sixty-five.

276
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.195
Hey. brother. that's a lot.

277
00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:08.905
You sure?

278
00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:11.575
I counted every single son of a bitch.

279
00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:13.201
All right!

280
00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:15.870
Sure. but are you counting
what happened last night?

281
00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:17.664
Of course.
that was number 65.

282
00:17:17.747 --> 00:17:21.293
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

283
00:17:21.376 --> 00:17:24.129
- Bullshit.
- [scoffs] Bullshit...

284
00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:26.005
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

285
00:17:26.172 --> 00:17:29.426
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground. dead.

286
00:17:29.593 --> 00:17:31.303
I shot him first.

287
00:17:33.346 --> 00:17:34.431
[inaudible chatter]

288
00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:38.101
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

289
00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:41.521
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

290
00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:42.814
So?

291
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:45.275
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations.

292
00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:47.235
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

293
00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:50.029
They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá.

294
00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.657
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car.

295
00:17:51.823 --> 00:17:53.450
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

296
00:17:55.118 --> 00:17:57.203
[up-tempo music continues on radio]

297
00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:02.167
- You don't have 65. Poi.
- Yes. I do.

298
00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:03.543
Eh!

299
00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:08.381
- [tires squealing]
- What are you doing. Gonorrhea?!

300
00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:11.050
Look. 65. man!

301
00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:13.928
[mutters in Spanish]

302
00:18:14.554 --> 00:18:16.889
Now we're going
to have to wash the car. man!

303
00:18:17.056 --> 00:18:19.184
- [scoffs]
- Son of a bitch.

304
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:21.311
- [phone ringing]
- Yes?

305
00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:23.021
[Suárez] Hi. Pablo.
I have good news for you.

306
00:18:23.188 --> 00:18:25.565
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

307
00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:27.817
And how much is it going to cost me?

308
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.237
Ten percent... $300.000.

309
00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:38.328
- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

310
00:18:38.495 --> 00:18:41.789
That Poison... he talks too much.

311
00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:44.125
You should take his phone away.

312
00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:45.460
Five percent.

313
00:18:51.508 --> 00:18:54.093
[speaks Spanish]
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

314
00:18:54.177 --> 00:18:57.305
[in English] OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

315
00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:00.016
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

316
00:19:03.687 --> 00:19:05.271
[phone ringing]

317
00:19:06.773 --> 00:19:09.150
- Hello?
- [Pablo speaking Spanish] Poison?

318
00:19:09.317 --> 00:19:12.111
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

319
00:19:12.278 --> 00:19:14.740
- Yes. I'm sorry. boss.
- Now!

320
00:19:16.908 --> 00:19:19.160
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

321
00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:23.665
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth. Poison.

322
00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:25.333
Pablo is really pissed off.

323
00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:29.462
Shut that mug.
or you will never reach 66. you hear?

324
00:19:39.222 --> 00:19:40.390
OK!

325
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:44.227
[men chattering in Spanish]

326
00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:49.232
[speaking English]
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

327
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.653
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

328
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.321
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

329
00:19:55.488 --> 00:19:57.824
[sighs] Yeah. if he did.
he must've had a better offer.

330
00:19:57.907 --> 00:19:59.743
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

331
00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:06.124
[speaking Spanish]
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood."

332
00:20:06.207 --> 00:20:08.126
but he is much more than that.

333
00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:11.879
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

334
00:20:11.963 --> 00:20:14.882
[Steve] To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune.

335
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:18.261
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega.

336
00:20:18.344 --> 00:20:20.680
a former congressman from Antioquia.

337
00:20:20.847 --> 00:20:22.390
[cheers and applause]

338
00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:27.312
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

339
00:20:33.025 --> 00:20:38.030
[speaking Spanish] I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

340
00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:44.245
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people. weak people.

341
00:20:45.163 --> 00:20:48.124
And this fight must begin here!

342
00:20:48.207 --> 00:20:51.252
[cheers and applause]

343
00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:57.300
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

344
00:20:57.467 --> 00:20:58.677
If I am elected...

345
00:20:59.594 --> 00:21:03.181
if my friend. Jairo. is elected...

346
00:21:03.264 --> 00:21:07.310
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

347
00:21:07.477 --> 00:21:09.813
[cheers and applause]

348
00:21:09.896 --> 00:21:13.441
Those who are hungry will have food.

349
00:21:13.608 --> 00:21:16.944
Those who want to learn will have schools.

350
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.656
And those who have dreams

351
00:21:19.823 --> 00:21:23.951
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

352
00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:27.997
- [cheering]
- In me. you have a friend

353
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.916
whom you have always had.

354
00:21:30.082 --> 00:21:33.628
the friend of today. the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

355
00:21:33.795 --> 00:21:36.923
[cheers and applause]

356
00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:38.049
Thank you very much.

357
00:21:40.593 --> 00:21:43.304
- [crowd chanting] Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- [Pablo] Thank you very much.

358
00:21:48.852 --> 00:21:51.855
My friend. Jairo Ortega!

359
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:54.774
[cheers and applause]

360
00:21:59.278 --> 00:22:02.657
[chanting] Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

361
00:22:02.824 --> 00:22:03.950
Thank you very much.

362
00:22:11.708 --> 00:22:13.418
- You were marvelous. my love.
- You sure?

363
00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:16.379
- Yes.
- [Valeria] Very good. Pablo.

364
00:22:16.588 --> 00:22:19.465
There are a few things we can improve.
but we'll work on them.

365
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:20.466
OK. whatever you say.

366
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.344
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much. Valeria.

367
00:22:23.428 --> 00:22:24.679
Congratulations. ma'am.

368
00:22:27.014 --> 00:22:28.015
Excuse me.

369
00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:34.689
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

370
00:22:39.402 --> 00:22:43.155
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

371
00:22:45.157 --> 00:22:47.911
[coughing. gasping]

372
00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.747
Tata. what's wrong?

373
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:57.378
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

374
00:22:57.462 --> 00:22:59.213
What are you talking about?

375
00:23:00.298 --> 00:23:03.551
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

376
00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:08.306
Tata. she's a newspaper woman.
a reporter who follows the news.

377
00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:11.183
And right now. I'm the news.

378
00:23:12.602 --> 00:23:16.856
When you win. don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

379
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.692
[softly] Come here.
Come here. come here. come here.

380
00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:22.278
Slowly... come on.

381
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:23.947
- [gasps]
- [whispers] Come on.

382
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.245
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

383
00:23:31.913 --> 00:23:35.416
Therefore. you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

384
00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:38.419
[voice quavering]
That woman is not on your level. Pablo.

385
00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:39.712
She degrades you.

386
00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:42.465
Please. don't worry about Valeria.

387
00:23:44.425 --> 00:23:46.552
[gasping]

388
00:23:46.636 --> 00:23:48.763
[cries out] Pablo!

389
00:23:50.139 --> 00:23:52.475
- A car. please!
- [gasping]

390
00:23:52.558 --> 00:23:54.686
- A car to the hospital. now!
- [cries out]

391
00:24:04.946 --> 00:24:06.113
You know what. Pablo?

392
00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:10.535
To me. it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

393
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:12.912
[sniffs]

394
00:24:13.913 --> 00:24:17.542
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

395
00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:20.753
Thing is.
you can't be a politician.

396
00:24:21.546 --> 00:24:22.797
Says who?

397
00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:28.053
[sighs] You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

398
00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:29.846
simply so they will love you.

399
00:24:32.098 --> 00:24:34.767
We... are bandits.

400
00:24:40.147 --> 00:24:44.151
If you run for Congress. find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

401
00:24:44.318 --> 00:24:46.362
[doctor] Señor Escobar?

402
00:24:46.445 --> 00:24:50.075
- Come meet your daughter.
- [baby crying]

403
00:24:55.955 --> 00:24:58.583
God has blessed us with a girl. Pablo.

404
00:25:02.128 --> 00:25:04.089
[whispers] How beautiful.

405
00:25:07.675 --> 00:25:10.261
Shh.

406
00:25:10.386 --> 00:25:11.888
Shh.

407
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.601
[whispers indistinctly]

408
00:25:18.686 --> 00:25:20.063
[camera clicks]

409
00:25:22.107 --> 00:25:24.817
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

410
00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:29.363
[plane flying overhead]

411
00:25:34.368 --> 00:25:36.037
[Fabio] Pablo is out of control.

412
00:25:39.331 --> 00:25:42.501
Mother Mary. man.
What do you want us to do?

413
00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:46.965
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

414
00:25:47.132 --> 00:25:48.257
Oh. no?

415
00:25:49.134 --> 00:25:50.259
And why not?

416
00:25:50.342 --> 00:25:53.096
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

417
00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.519
You know what he's doing. right?

418
00:26:00.603 --> 00:26:05.608
According to Colombian law.
a congressman has total immunity.

419
00:26:05.775 --> 00:26:09.904
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

420
00:26:09.988 --> 00:26:13.240
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."

421
00:26:13.324 --> 00:26:15.409
So what do we do?

422
00:26:15.493 --> 00:26:20.790
Well... we fulfill our duties.
stuffing the ballot box.

423
00:26:20.873 --> 00:26:25.920
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause. and take the risk.

424
00:26:26.004 --> 00:26:32.051
We continue with our business...
in the shadows. like always.

425
00:26:33.469 --> 00:26:35.513
Carlos. what are the guys saying?

426
00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:39.350
I imagine that they're worried. right?

427
00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:42.020
They are not politically conscious.
brother.

428
00:26:45.523 --> 00:26:48.359
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

429
00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:54.323
You do understand me. brother.

430
00:26:56.534 --> 00:27:00.329
Imagine... a state governed by us.

431
00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:03.749
Immunity for everyone. brother.

432
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:06.711
We. Carlos. belong to the people.

433
00:27:06.794 --> 00:27:10.131
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

434
00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:12.258
If you win.
you don't need to explain anything.

435
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:16.137
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

436
00:27:16.221 --> 00:27:17.763
[voice straining] I like that.

437
00:27:19.098 --> 00:27:21.142
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

438
00:27:21.226 --> 00:27:22.727
Yes.

439
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.478
He also said that no politician

440
00:27:24.562 --> 00:27:27.899
should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.

441
00:27:29.067 --> 00:27:31.027
[giggling]

442
00:27:36.157 --> 00:27:37.783
[chuckles]

443
00:27:40.912 --> 00:27:43.622
[hysterical laughter]

444
00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:50.504
Well. that's what he said.

445
00:27:53.424 --> 00:27:55.176
[sighs] And if I tell you. Carlos...

446
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.928
[sniffing]

447
00:27:57.011 --> 00:28:00.723
that what I want. sincerely...

448
00:28:01.682 --> 00:28:03.851
is to help the poor people
of this country...

449
00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:06.938
do you believe me or what?

450
00:28:09.274 --> 00:28:11.400
[Steve]
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

451
00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:14.153
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

452
00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:17.949
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

453
00:28:18.116 --> 00:28:21.493
in the fight against the oligarchs.
"The Men of Always."

454
00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:26.999
And just like any politician.
he made plenty of promises.

455
00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:31.420
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

456
00:28:32.297 --> 00:28:33.756
[cheering]

457
00:28:33.923 --> 00:28:36.425
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

458
00:28:36.592 --> 00:28:37.927
[crowd chanting] Pablo! Pablo!

459
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.264
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

460
00:28:42.723 --> 00:28:45.559
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs.

461
00:28:45.643 --> 00:28:49.105
- so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.
- [plane flies overhead]

462
00:28:49.188 --> 00:28:53.818
With characteristic German efficiency.
he turned the labs into Nazilandia.

463
00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:57.404
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

464
00:28:59.991 --> 00:29:03.369
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

465
00:29:03.452 --> 00:29:06.497
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega.

466
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.624
his front man.
once the election was over.

467
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:13.545
[speaking Spanish] As soon as the results
come out. Jairo Ortega will resign.

468
00:29:13.712 --> 00:29:16.799
I say he's running toward his death.

469
00:29:19.177 --> 00:29:20.845
- [horse snorts]
- [chattering in Spanish]

470
00:29:22.138 --> 00:29:24.640
[Steve]
As for us. we were kind of divided.

471
00:29:24.723 --> 00:29:27.726
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

472
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.729
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

473
00:29:30.813 --> 00:29:32.690
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

474
00:29:32.773 --> 00:29:34.483
No one will go on record.

475
00:29:35.651 --> 00:29:37.111
I got a better idea.

476
00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:39.697
We let him win.

477
00:29:39.864 --> 00:29:41.949
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker.

478
00:29:42.116 --> 00:29:44.660
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

479
00:29:46.954 --> 00:29:48.664
[Steve]
But first. we had to get proof

480
00:29:48.747 --> 00:29:51.250
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

481
00:29:51.417 --> 00:29:53.502
So we went to Suárez.

482
00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:55.921
- and gave him a lot of money.
- [speaking Spanish]

483
00:29:57.173 --> 00:30:01.427
First. he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76.

484
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.181
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

485
00:30:08.893 --> 00:30:13.480
Problem was. Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

486
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.235
[body thuds]

487
00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:23.741
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

488
00:30:27.995 --> 00:30:30.039
[Steve] Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

489
00:30:30.122 --> 00:30:32.417
- who reported the arrest...
- [groaning]

490
00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:35.169
...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

491
00:30:35.378 --> 00:30:38.381
and finally. the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

492
00:30:38.547 --> 00:30:40.216
[overlapping chatter]

493
00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:42.801
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

494
00:30:42.968 --> 00:30:45.221
You get too close to us.
you disappear.

495
00:30:45.388 --> 00:30:47.681
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

496
00:30:49.016 --> 00:30:50.893
If he was arrested.
there's gotta be a mug shot.

497
00:30:50.976 --> 00:30:52.937
[Javier]
Yeah. well. the file's gone.

498
00:30:53.104 --> 00:30:55.481
If there was a mug shot.
then it's gone. too.

499
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.026
If there was a photo.
there's a negative.

500
00:31:00.111 --> 00:31:02.029
[Steve] Finally. it dawned on us.

501
00:31:02.196 --> 00:31:05.574
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help.

502
00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:10.121
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

503
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.666
- [tires screech]
- [man grunting]

504
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.504
We got his negatives. and for safekeeping.
we put him into witness protection.

505
00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:24.718
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

506
00:31:26.553 --> 00:31:27.638
And what am I doing here?

507
00:31:27.721 --> 00:31:30.599
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

508
00:31:30.682 --> 00:31:33.685
Once again. the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

509
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:35.604
Your party took money from Escobar.

510
00:31:35.687 --> 00:31:37.440
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

511
00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:38.816
Everyone took money.

512
00:31:38.983 --> 00:31:43.237
By the way. it's all American money.
so why don't you take this to the press?

513
00:31:43.321 --> 00:31:46.198
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

514
00:31:48.534 --> 00:31:52.079
[Steve] Come election day.
sure enough. it was a landslide.

515
00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:54.540
The New Liberal party had the candidate

516
00:31:54.706 --> 00:31:57.543
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

517
00:31:57.626 --> 00:31:59.753
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

518
00:31:59.837 --> 00:32:01.713
[Ortega speaking Spanish]
Ladies and gentlemen.

519
00:32:01.797 --> 00:32:04.883
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

520
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:08.929
I wish to communicate to you my decision

521
00:32:09.013 --> 00:32:12.766
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

522
00:32:12.933 --> 00:32:16.479
- [crowd murmuring]
- ...for reasons of family and health.

523
00:32:16.645 --> 00:32:20.774
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

524
00:32:20.858 --> 00:32:24.778
is going to continue
our social and political ideas.

525
00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:27.698
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

526
00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:29.741
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much. Jairo.

527
00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:31.618
- [applause]
- I will give my best effort.

528
00:32:31.743 --> 00:32:32.578
Thank you very much.

529
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:35.498
[all singing Colombian national anthem]

530
00:32:57.936 --> 00:32:59.688
[song fades]

531
00:33:03.901 --> 00:33:05.777
[thunder rumbles in distance]

532
00:33:05.861 --> 00:33:08.447
[Steve]
Imagine you were born in a poor family.

533
00:33:08.531 --> 00:33:12.451
in a poor city. in a poor country.

534
00:33:12.535 --> 00:33:14.828
and by the time you were 28 years old.

535
00:33:14.912 --> 00:33:17.956
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

536
00:33:18.874 --> 00:33:21.043
[thunder continues]

537
00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:22.711
What do you do?

538
00:33:22.878 --> 00:33:26.006
- [bells tolling in distance]
- You make your dreams come true.

539
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.051
[rain pattering]

540
00:33:29.134 --> 00:33:31.845
[thunder rumbles]

541
00:33:33.222 --> 00:33:35.974
Problem is. nobody can control
the dreams they have.

542
00:33:41.313 --> 00:33:43.065
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

543
00:33:44.983 --> 00:33:47.653
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

544
00:33:52.783 --> 00:33:55.869
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

545
00:33:57.913 --> 00:34:00.999
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

546
00:34:03.877 --> 00:34:06.880
where. in their heads.
people fly as high as Icarus.

547
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.678
But even magical realism has its limits.

548
00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:16.265
[speaking Spanish]
Congressman Escobar... Sir!

549
00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:17.933
Excuse me.

550
00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:20.561
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

551
00:34:20.645 --> 00:34:22.896
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

552
00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.109
All right.

553
00:34:27.192 --> 00:34:29.570
- What is your name?
- Juan.

554
00:34:29.654 --> 00:34:31.238
Look. Juan...

555
00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:35.117
that is a really nice tie.

556
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.661
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

557
00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:38.078
Yes.

558
00:34:38.162 --> 00:34:41.748
Well. she's in the history books now.

559
00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:44.418
- Thank you very much. my son.
- Thank you. sir.

560
00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:45.836
- Thank you.
- All right.

561
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:51.676
[Steve]
And when you get too close to the sun...

562
00:34:52.718 --> 00:34:54.803
your dreams may melt away.

563
00:34:59.517 --> 00:35:02.019
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

564
00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:10.861
[man] Good morning.

565
00:35:12.613 --> 00:35:16.408
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

566
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:23.790
The Minister of Justice.
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

567
00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:26.711
is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

568
00:35:26.877 --> 00:35:30.381
I give the floor to you. Mr. Minister.

569
00:35:30.464 --> 00:35:31.882
Thank you very much.

570
00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:41.600
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money.

571
00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:47.231
"hot money."
in our national political process.

572
00:35:47.398 --> 00:35:52.194
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

573
00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:55.989
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

574
00:36:01.078 --> 00:36:03.581
To this charge. I plead guilty.

575
00:36:03.789 --> 00:36:05.999
[crowd murmuring]

576
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:09.836
In my eyes.
the sin of turning a blind eye

577
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.256
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

578
00:36:12.423 --> 00:36:16.051
We are a nation of the blind.
and in our blindness.

579
00:36:16.134 --> 00:36:19.179
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

580
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.602
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

581
00:36:26.812 --> 00:36:29.774
[overlapping murmurs]

582
00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.360
Congressman Escobar...

583
00:36:34.737 --> 00:36:38.741
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

584
00:36:41.285 --> 00:36:45.080
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

585
00:36:45.872 --> 00:36:48.375
For this reason.
I demand your resignation.

586
00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:50.628
You are not welcome in this chamber.

587
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.004
You don't belong here.

588
00:37:09.229 --> 00:37:10.355
[inaudible murmur]

589
00:37:39.217 --> 00:37:41.846
Thank you very much. Juan.
Very kind.

590
00:37:41.928 --> 00:37:43.639
[Lara] What interests the narcos

591
00:37:43.722 --> 00:37:47.309
isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice.

592
00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:51.313
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

593
00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:55.275
His two arms: silver or lead.

594
00:37:55.442 --> 00:38:01.573
I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

595
00:38:01.657 --> 00:38:05.452
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

596
00:38:05.536 --> 00:38:08.497
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

597
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.751
To the contrary.
I will proceed to denounce him legally

598
00:38:12.835 --> 00:38:15.629
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

599
00:38:15.796 --> 00:38:18.340
[Steve]
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense.

600
00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:20.718
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

601
00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:23.804
[Pablo speaking Spanish] I am not looking
for. nor do I long for a confrontation

602
00:38:23.888 --> 00:38:25.013
before the Colombian people.

603
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.600
I look for peace.
I have always preached peace.

604
00:38:28.684 --> 00:38:32.604
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

605
00:38:32.771 --> 00:38:36.233
[Lara] It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

606
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.361
can be threatened or bought at will.

607
00:38:39.528 --> 00:38:43.908
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

608
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.659
[Steve]
But Lara wouldn't back down.

609
00:38:45.743 --> 00:38:48.245
He denounced narcos at every opportunity.

610
00:38:48.328 --> 00:38:51.248
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

611
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:54.668
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

612
00:38:54.752 --> 00:38:56.503
were owned by drug traffickers.

613
00:38:57.963 --> 00:39:02.008
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team.

614
00:39:02.092 --> 00:39:04.595
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

615
00:39:05.846 --> 00:39:09.850
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

616
00:39:13.812 --> 00:39:16.231
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

617
00:39:16.398 --> 00:39:18.066
of elephants and camels from Africa.

618
00:39:20.402 --> 00:39:22.696
And with the action of one brave man.

619
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.824
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

620
00:39:25.908 --> 00:39:28.076
[Lara speaking Spanish]
What are required are honest men.

621
00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:32.831
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers.

622
00:39:32.915 --> 00:39:39.797
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

623
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.673
who is against their interests.

624
00:39:41.757 --> 00:39:45.677
[Steve] Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

625
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.805
with his stand against the narcos.

626
00:39:47.888 --> 00:39:50.348
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

627
00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:55.186
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

628
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:59.566
For his own safety. he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

629
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.195
He was slated to leave in two weeks.
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

630
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.074
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

631
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.078
You feel responsible. is that it?

632
00:40:13.664 --> 00:40:15.040
Somewhat. yes. sir.

633
00:40:15.958 --> 00:40:20.253
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

634
00:40:21.212 --> 00:40:24.382
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

635
00:40:24.466 --> 00:40:26.677
for American policy objectives?

636
00:40:28.428 --> 00:40:31.473
Let me assure you. Agent Murphy.
outside of providing me with the picture.

637
00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:33.224
you... did nothing.

638
00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.604
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

639
00:40:37.771 --> 00:40:40.607
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest. sir.

640
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:56.707
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

641
00:40:56.874 --> 00:40:59.960
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

642
00:41:00.044 --> 00:41:01.378
And what is that?

643
00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:05.799
We accept your help.
but never your condescension.

644
00:41:06.884 --> 00:41:10.929
When all this is over. Colombians
will be the heroes. and the victims.

645
00:41:12.472 --> 00:41:15.350
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

646
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.728
Just wear the vest.

647
00:41:30.657 --> 00:41:32.826
[speaking Spanish]
Oh. Pablito.

648
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.704
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

649
00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:40.625
Damned bastards.

650
00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:49.426
You're too good for them. Pablito.

651
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.273
[sighs]

652
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.243
This is a fight
that you cannot win. cousin.

653
00:42:17.662 --> 00:42:21.041
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

654
00:42:23.752 --> 00:42:26.088
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

655
00:42:31.635 --> 00:42:33.178
I will fix it.

656
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.401
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

657
00:42:48.485 --> 00:42:51.780
by Minister Lara and his cronies.

658
00:42:51.947 --> 00:42:55.492
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

659
00:42:57.744 --> 00:43:01.165
I ran as a representative
for the common man.

660
00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:04.126
a voice for those who had no voice.

661
00:43:04.292 --> 00:43:07.587
but that has happened
through much of our history.

662
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:11.925
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

663
00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:14.469
I dreamt of doing good.

664
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:17.973
Those dreams are over.

665
00:43:19.891 --> 00:43:24.896
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

666
00:43:25.897 --> 00:43:27.273
I will fight.

667
00:43:27.941 --> 00:43:30.610
"The Men of Always" are mistaken

668
00:43:30.777 --> 00:43:34.990
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

669
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:47.335
Thank you very much.

670
00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:51.339
- Thank you very much.
- [applause continues]

671
00:43:53.758 --> 00:43:56.386
- [low conversations]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

672
00:44:15.363 --> 00:44:16.531
He didn't wear it.

673
00:44:17.866 --> 00:44:19.284
[sighs]

674
00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:21.327
Wouldn't have made a difference.

675
00:44:21.995 --> 00:44:25.249
[Steve]
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

676
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.920
It was the first time
