'General opinion makes out
that we live in a world of hatred and greed

'but I don't see that.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:24.935
'Seems to me that love is everywhere.

(Sighs) It's just I know the old version
so well. you know.

19
00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:30.022
Well. we all do.

20
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.376
That's why we're making the new version.

21

Right. OK. let's go.

Oh. fuck. wank. bugger.

And so the feeling grows

35
00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:24.699
So the feeling grows

36
00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:28.103
It's written in the wind
In the wind

37
00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:30.707
It's everywhere I go

38
00:03:30.747 --> 00:03:35.298
Everywhere I go

39
00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:38.896
So if you really love Christmas
Love Christmas

40
00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.461
Come on and let it snow

41
00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:43.463
Come on and let it...

42
00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:45.702
This is shit. isn't it?

43
00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:48.341
Yep. solid gold shit. maestro.

44
00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:14.942
- God. I'm so late.
- It's just round the corner. you'll make it.

45
00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:18.138
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

46
00:04:18.187 --> 00:04:20.496
No. really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

47
00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:23.141
- I love you.
- I know.

48
00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:27.146
I love you even when you're sick
and look disgusting.

49
00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:30.577
I know. Now. go or you will actually miss it.

50
00:04:30.627 --> 00:04:32.345
Right.

51
00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:39.384
- Did I mention that I love you?
- Yes. you did. Get out. loser.

52
00:04:55.907 --> 00:04:58.626
Karen. it's me again.

53
00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:03.058
I'm sorry. I literally don't have
anybody else to talk to.

54
00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:07.064
Absolutely. Horrible moment. though.
Can I call you back?

55
00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:08.540
Of course.

56
00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:12.375
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

57
00:05:12.427 --> 00:05:14.543
Understood.

58
00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:16.896
Er. bugger off. call me later.

59
00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:22.105
So what's this big news?

60
00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:24.741
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

61
00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:26.539
and I'm the lobster.

62
00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:28.225
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:31.976
- In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

64
00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:35.224
There was more than one lobster present
at the birth of Jesus?

65
00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:37.223
Duh.

66
00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:43.777
Best sandwiches in Britain.

67
00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:47.142
Try my lovely nuts?

68
00:05:49.427 --> 00:05:52.021
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

69
00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:57.263
Morning. my future wife.

70
00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:16.978
(Man) OK. you can stop there. Thanks.

71
00:06:17.027 --> 00:06:19.336
(2nd man) I need a couple of orange gels.

72
00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:22.697
By the way. he introduced me as John
but everyone calls me Jack.

73
00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:25.705
Oh. fine. Nice to meet you. Jack.

74
00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:27.817
He got me right. though. I'm just Judy.

75
00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:30.301
Great. Just Judy!

76
00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:37.780
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

77
00:06:37.827 --> 00:06:41.217
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

78
00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.782
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

79
00:06:44.827 --> 00:06:48.217
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

80
00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.258
That is true.

81
00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.577
Good luck. kiddo.

82
00:07:06.347 --> 00:07:08.417
(Cheering. applause)

83
00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:19.500
(Press shouting) Prime Minister. over here!

84
00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:30.346
(Cheering)

85
00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:32.378
Thank you.

86
00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:38.059
- Welcome. Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

87
00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:40.018
How are you?

88
00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.183
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

89
00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:44.343
Cool. Powerful.

90
00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:46.981
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

91
00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:49.621
Yes. I would like that very much indeed.

92
00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:53.023
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

93
00:07:54.187 --> 00:07:57.065
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning. sir.

94
00:07:57.107 --> 00:07:59.701
Good morning.
I had an uncle called Terence.

95
00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:03.865
Hated him. I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

96
00:08:03.907 --> 00:08:05.977
- This is Pat.
- Hello. Pat.

97
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.461
Good morning. sir. I'm the housekeeper.

98
00:08:08.507 --> 00:08:11.021
Oh. right. I should be easier than the last lot.

99
00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:13.820
No nappies. no teenagers. no scary wife.

100
00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:16.620
And this is Natalie. She's new. like you.

101
00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:20.262
- Hello. Natalie.
- Hello. David. I mean. sir.

102
00:08:20.307 --> 00:08:22.537
Shit. I can't believe I've just said that.

103
00:08:22.587 --> 00:08:26.182
And now I've gone and said "shit".
Twice. I'm so sorry. sir.

104
00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:29.503
You could've said "fuck"
and we'd have been in real trouble.

105
00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:33.222
Thank you. sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

106
00:08:34.987 --> 00:08:37.706
Oh. piss it!

107
00:08:37.747 --> 00:08:42.343
Right. I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country. shall we?

108
00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:44.218
Yeah. I can't see why not.

109
00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:59.227
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

110
00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:01.258
- Yes. I did.
- I just went "blurh".

111
00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.537
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

112
00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:06.818
Yeah. I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

113
00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:08.744
Ah.

114
00:09:08.787 --> 00:09:10.778
(Clears throat)

115
00:09:12.747 --> 00:09:14.942
Oh. no.

116
00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:17.103
That is so inconvenient.

117
00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:21.786
In the presence of God.
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

118
00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:26.295
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

119
00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:29.339
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

120
00:09:29.387 --> 00:09:33.300
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.

121
00:09:35.987 --> 00:09:38.023
(Organ plays Wedding March)

122
00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:41.745
And you resisted
the temptation for surprises.

123
00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:43.857
Yeah. I'm mature now.

124
00:09:44.587 --> 00:09:47.863
(Wedding March becomes
La Marseillaise)

125
00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:56.065
(Chorus) Love. love. love

126
00:09:57.587 --> 00:10:00.897
Love. love. love

127
00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:04.262
- Love. love. love...
- Did you do this?

128
00:10:04.307 --> 00:10:07.219
Er. no.

129
00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:11.340
Love. love. love. love

130
00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:16.142
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

131
00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:18.178
Oh. it...

132
00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:20.900
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

133
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:25.826
There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

134
00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:29.257
It's easy

135
00:10:30.467 --> 00:10:32.776
All you need is love

136
00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:37.455
All you need is love

137
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:43.860
All you need is love. love

138
00:10:44.747 --> 00:10:47.102
Love is all you need...

139
00:10:49.187 --> 00:10:51.542
Look. it's Pikey.

140
00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:04.820
Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:11:04.867 --> 00:11:07.665
Oh. I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

142
00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.540
- The lady of the house let you in. did she?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:13.863
- Lovely. obliging girl.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:17.104
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

145
00:11:17.147 --> 00:11:21.345
- Oh.
- Listen. erm. I've been thinking.

146
00:11:21.387 --> 00:11:25.665
I think we ought to take Mum out for
her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

147
00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:30.178
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

148
00:11:30.227 --> 00:11:32.138
(Girlfriend) Hurry up. big boy!

149
00:11:32.187 --> 00:11:36.146
I'm naked and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

150
00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:40.217
(Music and chatter)

151
00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:48.303
(Juliet) I am so happy to see you!

152
00:11:49.627 --> 00:11:52.300
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er. no. thanks.

153
00:11:57.627 --> 00:11:59.822
Taste explosion?

154
00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:13.423
- Food?
- No. thanks.

155
00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:15.458
Yeah. a bit dodgy. isn't it?

156
00:12:15.507 --> 00:12:19.022
Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.

157
00:12:19.067 --> 00:12:21.422
Oh. Tastes like it. too.

158
00:12:24.907 --> 00:12:26.977
I'm Colin. by the way.

159
00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:29.461
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

160
00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:31.862
- What do you do. Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

161
00:12:31.907 --> 00:12:33.784
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes. I do.

162
00:12:33.827 --> 00:12:37.536
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

163
00:12:37.587 --> 00:12:40.977
- God. I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

164
00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:43.177
(Embarrassed giggle) Right.

165
00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:48.937
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

166
00:12:48.987 --> 00:12:51.376
English girls. They're stuck up. you see.

167
00:12:51.427 --> 00:12:56.023
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler. game for a laugh.

168
00:12:56.067 --> 00:13:00.185
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!

169
00:13:00.227 --> 00:13:03.219
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

170
00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:05.462
I think it's crap. Colin.

171
00:13:05.507 --> 00:13:07.259
That's where you're wrong.

172
00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.219
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

173
00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:14.260
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes. I do! I'm going to America.

174
00:13:14.307 --> 00:13:17.663
Colin. you're a Ionely. ugly arsehole.
Accept it.

175
00:13:17.707 --> 00:13:22.497
Never. I am Colin. God of Sex.
I'm just on the wrong continent. that's all.

176
00:13:22.547 --> 00:13:25.266
Bit of quiet
while we finish the lighting. guys!

177
00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:29.823
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

178
00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:32.222
Judy. could you take the top off this time?

179
00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:36.340
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the. erm. nipples and when we're not.

180
00:13:36.387 --> 00:13:39.857
Yes. OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

181
00:13:39.907 --> 00:13:41.306
Not always the case. is it?

182
00:13:41.347 --> 00:13:44.976
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years In Tibet...

183
00:13:45.027 --> 00:13:47.177
- Yes. yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

184
00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:50.139
Guys. time's tight
and we have to get the actors in.

185
00:13:50.187 --> 00:13:52.257
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

186
00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:54.184
(Judy laughs)

187
00:13:54.907 --> 00:13:58.900
(Director) Right. let's have
another look at that. please.

188
00:14:09.427 --> 00:14:11.782
Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

189
00:14:11.827 --> 00:14:14.057
- OK. yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

190
00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:15.859
I'll warm them up!

191
00:14:18.507 --> 00:14:21.305
- And massage them. please.
- Right.

192
00:14:26.507 --> 00:14:31.376
It's junction 13 that's just murder. isn't it?
Total gridlock this morning.

193
00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:39.977
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

194
00:14:40.027 --> 00:14:42.336
Some of her requests.

195
00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:47.905
for instance. that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral.

196
00:14:47.947 --> 00:14:51.656
I was confident she expected me to ignore.

197
00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:54.744
But others she was pretty damn clear about.

198
00:14:56.027 --> 00:14:59.144
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen.

199
00:15:00.187 --> 00:15:02.701
I said. "Over my dead body."

200
00:15:02.747 --> 00:15:05.784
And she said. "No. Daniel. over mine."

201
00:15:05.827 --> 00:15:08.864
And as usual. my darling girl...

202
00:15:10.507 --> 00:15:12.737
and Sam's darling mum was right.

203
00:15:14.107 --> 00:15:18.817
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but.

204
00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:20.858
inevitably.

205
00:15:22.067 --> 00:15:24.058
ever so coolly.

206
00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:28.537
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

207
00:15:29.107 --> 00:15:32.736
(On speakers)
Bye bye baby. baby goodbye

208
00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:36.905
Goodbye baby. baby bye bye

209
00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:38.744
Bye bye baby

210
00:15:38.787 --> 00:15:43.736
Don't make me cry
Goodbye baby. baby bye bye

211
00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:47.575
You're the one girl in town I'd marry

212
00:15:47.627 --> 00:15:52.747
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free

213
00:15:52.787 --> 00:15:57.702
I wish it could be

214
00:15:57.747 --> 00:16:01.535
I could love you but why begin it?

215
00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:04.545
Cos there ain't any future in it

216
00:16:04.587 --> 00:16:08.023
She's got me but I'm not free so...

217
00:16:08.987 --> 00:16:11.660
(From DJ booth)
Bye bye baby. baby goodbye

218
00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:16.223
Goodbye baby. baby bye bye

219
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.986
Bye bye baby. don't make me cry

220
00:16:19.027 --> 00:16:22.906
Goodbye baby. baby bye bye

221
00:16:22.947 --> 00:16:24.699
Wish I never had known you...

222
00:16:24.747 --> 00:16:27.215
Do you love him?

223
00:16:27.267 --> 00:16:29.258
Er. er. what?

224
00:16:29.307 --> 00:16:32.936
No. l-I just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

225
00:16:32.987 --> 00:16:37.697
and you needed someone to talk to about it
and no one had ever asked you.

226
00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:42.377
No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

227
00:16:42.427 --> 00:16:44.338
...on my finger...

228
00:16:44.387 --> 00:16:46.218
So that's a no. then?

229
00:16:46.267 --> 00:16:48.337
Yes. Erm...

230
00:16:48.387 --> 00:16:50.776
Bye bye baby. baby goodbye

231
00:16:50.827 --> 00:16:52.818
Goodbye baby. baby bye bye...

232
00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:55.665
This DJ. what do you reckon?

233
00:16:55.707 --> 00:16:58.505
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

234
00:16:58.547 --> 00:17:00.902
I think it all hangs on the next song.

235
00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:02.903
Now here's one for the lovers.

236
00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:06.826
That's quite a few of you.
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

237
00:17:06.867 --> 00:17:09.017
(S Club Juniors: Puppy Love)

238
00:17:10.427 --> 00:17:12.657
And they called it...

239
00:17:12.707 --> 00:17:17.656
- He's done it. it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

240
00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:21.700
Oh. I guess they'll never know...

241
00:17:21.747 --> 00:17:24.056
(Knocks)

242
00:17:24.907 --> 00:17:26.704
Sarah's waiting for you.

243
00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:30.181
Oh. yes. of course. erm...

244
00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:33.097
Great. er. good. good.

245
00:17:33.147 --> 00:17:37.186
How are you doing. Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

246
00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:38.899
Absolutely.

247
00:17:41.107 --> 00:17:42.859
- Harry?
- Sarah.

248
00:17:42.907 --> 00:17:49.745
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

249
00:17:52.387 --> 00:17:55.220
Two years. seven months.

250
00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:57.861
three days and. I suppose. what. two hours?

251
00:17:57.907 --> 00:18:02.742
And how long have you been in love
with Karl. our enigmatic chief designer?

252
00:18:03.747 --> 00:18:05.738
Um...

253
00:18:08.547 --> 00:18:13.337
Two years. seven months. three days
and. I suppose. an hour and 30 minutes.

254
00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:15.025
Thought as much.

255
00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:17.058
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

256
00:18:17.107 --> 00:18:19.302
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

257
00:18:20.347 --> 00:18:23.225
Oh. that is... that is bad news.

258
00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:28.500
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

259
00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:31.896
- Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink

260
00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:36.623
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

261
00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:38.942
- You know that?
- Yes.

262
00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:42.302
And so does Karl.

263
00:18:42.347 --> 00:18:44.736
Think about it. for all our sakes.

264
00:18:44.787 --> 00:18:47.255
It's Christmas.

265
00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:52.017
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

266
00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:54.183
Thanks. boss.

267
00:18:55.707 --> 00:18:57.902

- Hi. Karl.

270
00:19:08.107 --> 00:19:11.224
Babe. Absolutely. fire away.

271
00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:14.423
Mia. Mia. would you turn that down?

272
00:19:16.427 --> 00:19:18.099
What is that?

273
00:19:18.147 --> 00:19:21.617
That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

274
00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:24.500
Oh. dear me. how are the mighty fallen.

275
00:19:24.547 --> 00:19:29.985
I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

276
00:19:30.027 --> 00:19:34.020
Oh. and coincidentally.
I believe Billy will be a guest

277
00:19:34.067 --> 00:19:36.706
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

278

Welcome back. Bill.

279
00:19:39.867 --> 00:19:41.858
Billy. welcome back to the airwaves.

New Christmas single.
cover of Love Is All Around.

281
00:19:45.027 --> 00:19:50.147
Except we've changed
the word "love" to "Christmas".

282
00:19:50.187 --> 00:19:53.259
Yes. is that an important message
to you. Bill?

283
00:19:53.307 --> 00:19:55.696
(Snorts) Not really. Mike.

284
00:19:55.747 --> 00:19:59.899
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

285
00:19:59.947 --> 00:20:02.336
- And that's not you?
- That's not me. Michael.

286
00:20:02.387 --> 00:20:06.221
When I was young and successful.
I was greedy and foolish

and now I'm left with no one.
wrinkled and alone.

288
00:20:10.307 --> 00:20:12.946
- Wow. Thanks for that. Bill.
- For what?

289
00:20:12.987 --> 00:20:15.740
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

290
00:20:15.787 --> 00:20:19.382
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford. I can tell you.

291
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:23.056
- Ask me anything. I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

292
00:20:23.107 --> 00:20:25.746
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

293
00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:27.982
No. only kidding! (Snorts)

294
00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:30.336
- She was rubbish.
- OK. here's one.

295
00:20:30.387 --> 00:20:34.824
How do you think the new record
compares to your old. classic stuff?

296
00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:38.257
Come on. Mikey. you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

297
00:20:38.307 --> 00:20:39.945
(Bill laughing)

298
00:20:39.987 --> 00:20:43.297
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

299
00:20:43.347 --> 00:20:45.577
wasn't some smug teenager

300
00:20:45.627 --> 00:20:49.779
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

301
00:20:49.827 --> 00:20:53.217
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

302
00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:55.861
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

303
00:20:55.907 --> 00:20:59.377
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe.

304
00:20:59.427 --> 00:21:01.463
ugliest man in the world.

305
00:21:01.507 --> 00:21:05.785
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

children. like your Uncle Billy does.

307
00:21:10.947 --> 00:21:14.576
buy my festering turd of a record.

308
00:21:14.627 --> 00:21:17.539
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

309
00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:21.865
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

310
00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:24.102
I think you're referring to

311
00:21:24.147 --> 00:21:26.377
"If you really love Christmas..."

312
00:21:26.427 --> 00:21:29.544
"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.

313
00:21:29.587 --> 00:21:31.578
So. here it is one more time.

314
00:21:31.627 --> 00:21:34.824
the dark horse for this year's
Christmas number one.

315
00:21:34.867 --> 00:21:39.179
Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you. Billy. After this. the news.

316
00:21:39.227 --> 00:21:41.661
Is the new prime minister in trouble already?

317
00:21:42.747 --> 00:21:46.626
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes

318
00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:50.107
- OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

319
00:21:50.147 --> 00:21:54.106
Ah. yes. yes. I fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play. Alex.

320
00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:59.299
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

321
00:21:59.347 --> 00:22:01.781
- like the last government.
- (AIl) Here. here.

322
00:22:01.827 --> 00:22:05.786
This is our first really important test.
let's take a stand.

323
00:22:05.827 --> 00:22:10.343
Right. Right. I understand that
but I have decided...

324
00:22:11.827 --> 00:22:13.818
not to. Not this time.

325
00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:18.224
Let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

326
00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:20.701
I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

327
00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:26.296
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

328
00:22:32.987 --> 00:22:34.705
Right.

329
00:22:34.747 --> 00:22:36.419
(Knocking)

330
00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:38.537
Yeah. come in.

331
00:22:42.587 --> 00:22:45.147
- These are from the Treasury...
- Uh-huh.

332
00:22:45.187 --> 00:22:48.179
...and these are for you.

333
00:22:48.227 --> 00:22:49.945
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

334
00:22:49.987 --> 00:22:54.026
I was hoping you'd win. not that
I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke.

335
00:22:54.067 --> 00:22:57.821
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

336
00:22:57.867 --> 00:22:59.698
Thanks very much. Thanks...

337
00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:03.337
Natalie.

338
00:23:07.627 --> 00:23:12.257
God. come on. get a grip.
You're the Prime Minister. for God's sake.

339
00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:16.661
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

340
00:23:16.707 --> 00:23:21.098
Oh. I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married. though.

341
00:23:21.147 --> 00:23:24.184
You know the type. he's married to his job.

342
00:23:24.227 --> 00:23:27.344
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

343
00:23:27.387 --> 00:23:30.538
Excuse me. Judy. if you could
just lower the nipples

344
00:23:30.587 --> 00:23:32.976
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

345
00:23:36.107 --> 00:23:38.621
I have to say. Judy. this is a real pleasure.

346
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:42.216
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

347
00:23:42.267 --> 00:23:44.258
- Thank you!
- Oh. well. you know.

348
00:23:44.307 --> 00:23:45.979
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

349
00:23:46.027 --> 00:23:48.302
The move again. please. Judy.

350
00:23:48.347 --> 00:23:50.781
- Ooh. sorry.
- Oh. God. sorry. You all right?

351
00:23:53.747 --> 00:23:56.705
- Exciting news!
- What?

352
00:23:56.747 --> 00:23:59.944
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

353
00:23:59.987 --> 00:24:01.386
- No.
- Yes!

354
00:24:01.427 --> 00:24:05.420
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

355
00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:08.982
Yes! Wisconsin babes.
here comes Sir Colin!

356
00:24:09.027 --> 00:24:13.066
No. Col! There are a few babes in America.
I grant you.

357
00:24:13.107 --> 00:24:15.780
but they're going out
with rich. attractive guys.

358
00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:18.944
Tone. you're just jealous.

359
00:24:18.987 --> 00:24:22.741
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

360
00:24:22.787 --> 00:24:27.019
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

361
00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:31.538
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

362
00:24:31.587 --> 00:24:36.342
No. I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

363
00:24:36.387 --> 00:24:38.582
- No. Colin. no!
- Yes!

364
00:24:38.627 --> 00:24:39.776
- Nyet!
- Da!

365
00:24:39.827 --> 00:24:41.146
- Nein!
- Ja. darling!

366
00:24:41.187 --> 00:24:44.782
Right. the Christmas party.
not my favourite night of the year

367
00:24:44.827 --> 00:24:47.102
and your unhappy job to organise.

368
00:24:47.147 --> 00:24:50.025
- Tell me.
- It's basic. really.

369
00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:53.742
Find a venue. over-order on the drinks.
bulk buy the guacamole

370
00:24:53.787 --> 00:24:57.666
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

371
00:24:57.707 --> 00:25:02.019
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean. not children.

372
00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:05.537
But their wives and girlfriends. et cetera.

373
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:11.105
Oh. Christ. you haven't got some horrible
six-foot. tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

374
00:25:11.147 --> 00:25:15.743
No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe.
hoping to be kissed.

375
00:25:17.027 --> 00:25:19.666
Really?

376
00:25:19.707 --> 00:25:21.698
Right.

377
00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:34.376
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean. he'll be up there now.

378
00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:37.976
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

379
00:25:38.027 --> 00:25:42.384
Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

380
00:25:42.427 --> 00:25:45.146
Yeah. but Karen. this is all the time.

381
00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:50.540
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong. you know?

382
00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:52.578
I mean. clearly it's about his mum

383
00:25:52.627 --> 00:25:57.576
but Christ. he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

384
00:25:57.627 --> 00:25:59.345
(Karen) At the age of 11?

385
00:25:59.387 --> 00:26:03.460
(Daniel) Well. maybe not his eyeballs. then.
Maybe just his veins.

386
00:26:03.507 --> 00:26:07.705
The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him. you know. and...

387
00:26:09.347 --> 00:26:14.467
I don't know. this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

388
00:26:14.507 --> 00:26:16.702
like it never did before.

389
00:26:16.747 --> 00:26:21.377
Listen. it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

390
00:26:21.427 --> 00:26:23.895
Just be patient.

391
00:26:23.947 --> 00:26:26.222
And maybe check the room for needles.

392
00:26:26.267 --> 00:26:31.057
And then when he sometimes does
come out. it's obvious he's been crying.

393
00:26:39.867 --> 00:26:43.257
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

394
00:26:43.307 --> 00:26:46.424
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

395
00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:50.420
I just don't know.

396
00:26:50.467 --> 00:26:53.061
Get a grip.

397
00:26:53.107 --> 00:26:55.223
People hate sissies.

398
00:26:55.267 --> 00:26:58.418
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

399
00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:01.300
Yeah. Absolutely.

400
00:27:01.347 --> 00:27:03.338
Helpful.

401
00:27:10.707 --> 00:27:14.416
So. what's the problem. Samuel?

402
00:27:16.227 --> 00:27:20.857
Is it just Mum or is it something else. huh?

403
00:27:22.187 --> 00:27:24.257
Maybe school?

404
00:27:25.387 --> 00:27:27.264
Are you being bullied?

405
00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:30.423
Or is it something worse?

406
00:27:32.147 --> 00:27:34.377
Can you give me any clues at all?

407
00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:38.984
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

408
00:27:39.027 --> 00:27:41.495
Even though you won't be able to help?

409
00:27:41.547 --> 00:27:44.061
Even if that's the case. yeah.

410
00:27:45.987 --> 00:27:48.342
OK. Well...

411
00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:52.140
truth is. actually...

412
00:27:53.147 --> 00:27:54.978
I'm in love.

413
00:27:55.027 --> 00:27:56.585
Sorry?

414
00:27:56.627 --> 00:28:01.018
I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

415
00:28:01.067 --> 00:28:05.185
I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

416
00:28:05.227 --> 00:28:09.140
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

417
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:12.099
Ah. well. OK. well...

418
00:28:13.867 --> 00:28:16.301
I'm a little relieved.

419
00:28:17.347 --> 00:28:19.417
- Why?
- Because I...

420
00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:21.537
thought it'd be something worse.

421
00:28:21.587 --> 00:28:24.499
Worse than the total agony of being in love?

422
00:28:24.547 --> 00:28:27.107
Er...

423
00:28:27.147 --> 00:28:29.741
No. you're right.

424
00:28:29.787 --> 00:28:31.857
Total agony.

425
00:29:07.387 --> 00:29:09.503
- Night. Sarah.
- Night. Karl.

426
00:29:13.787 --> 00:29:15.778
(Mobile)

427
00:29:18.987 --> 00:29:20.978
Yeah. absolutely.

428
00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:24.177
Free as a bird. Fire away.

429
00:29:54.387 --> 00:29:56.457
Alone again.

430
00:29:57.667 --> 00:29:59.305
Naturally.

431
00:29:59.347 --> 00:30:01.417
- I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

432
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.903
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

433
00:30:07.787 --> 00:30:09.345
Thanks.

434
00:30:09.387 --> 00:30:11.378
Natalie.

435
00:30:13.587 --> 00:30:16.226
Erm. I'm starting to feel...

436
00:30:17.347 --> 00:30:20.942
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

437
00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:25.378
and me knowing so little about you.
it seems elitist and wrong.

438
00:30:26.427 --> 00:30:28.179
Well. there's not much to know.

439
00:30:28.227 --> 00:30:31.617
Well. erm. where do you live. for instance?

440
00:30:31.667 --> 00:30:33.783
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

441
00:30:33.827 --> 00:30:37.058
- Ah. my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

442
00:30:38.267 --> 00:30:40.735
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

443
00:30:40.787 --> 00:30:44.257
At the end of the high street.
Harris Street. near the Queen's Head.

444
00:30:44.307 --> 00:30:47.060
- Oh. yeah. yeah. that is dodgy.
- Hm.

445
00:30:47.107 --> 00:30:51.225
Erm. and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

446
00:30:52.427 --> 00:30:55.305
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

447
00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:59.818
I've just split up with my boyfriend. so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

448
00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:04.019
- Ah. Sorry.
- No. it's fine.

449
00:31:04.067 --> 00:31:06.422
I'm well shot of him.

450
00:31:06.467 --> 00:31:09.186
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:31:09.227 --> 00:31:13.015
He said no one'd fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks.

452
00:31:13.067 --> 00:31:15.581
Not a nice guy. actually. in the end.

453
00:31:16.867 --> 00:31:18.858
No.

454
00:31:25.587 --> 00:31:27.703
You know. erm...

455
00:31:28.307 --> 00:31:31.504
being Prime Minister.
I could just have him murdered.

456
00:31:32.547 --> 00:31:34.936
Thank you. sir. I'll think about it.

457
00:31:34.987 --> 00:31:38.775
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

458
00:31:38.827 --> 00:31:42.661
Ruthless. trained killers
are just a phone call away.

459
00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:50.098
Oh. God.

460
00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:54.902
Did you have this kind of problem?

461
00:31:57.227 --> 00:31:59.741
Yeah. course you did. you saucy minx.

462
00:31:59.787 --> 00:32:03.097
So. let's go. We can definitely crack this.

463
00:32:03.147 --> 00:32:05.297
Remember. I was a kid once. too.

464
00:32:05.347 --> 00:32:09.579
So. come on. it's someone at school. Right?

465
00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:11.458
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good. good.

466
00:32:11.507 --> 00:32:14.499
And what does she. he. feel about you?

467
00:32:14.547 --> 00:32:17.380
SHE doesn't even know my name.

468
00:32:17.427 --> 00:32:20.146
And even if she did. she'd despise me.

469
00:32:20.187 --> 00:32:22.462
She's the coolest girl in school.

470
00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:26.466
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

471
00:32:26.507 --> 00:32:28.941
Good. Good.

472
00:32:30.147 --> 00:32:32.217
Well.

473
00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:34.861
basically you're fucked. aren't you?

474
00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:39.257
(All I Want For Christmas Is You)

475
00:32:40.827 --> 00:32:43.216
Hi there and welcome back.

476
00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:47.419
So. three weeks till Christmas. looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

477
00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:51.824
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

478
00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:54.176
No. Little scamps.

479
00:32:54.227 --> 00:32:57.537
But very. very talented musicians.

480
00:32:57.587 --> 00:33:01.705
Yeah. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

481
00:33:01.747 --> 00:33:03.180
Yes. I have. Ant or Dec.

482
00:33:03.227 --> 00:33:07.106
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

483
00:33:07.147 --> 00:33:08.739
Oh. great.

484
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:12.416
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass.

485
00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:17.063
so if you've got a framed picture.
like. for instance. this one of Blue.

486
00:33:17.107 --> 00:33:19.098
you can just write on it.

487
00:33:30.667 --> 00:33:32.225
(Kids snickering)

488
00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:36.021
(Dec) Er. a lot of kids watching. Billy.
(Billy) Oh. yeah.

489
00:33:36.067 --> 00:33:38.820
Hiya. kids.

490
00:33:38.867 --> 00:33:42.143
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

491
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:44.257
don't buy drugs.

492
00:33:46.147 --> 00:33:49.105
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

493
00:33:49.147 --> 00:33:53.777
And I do believe it's a commercial break.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

494
00:33:53.827 --> 00:33:58.457
All I want for Christmas is you

495
00:34:05.387 --> 00:34:09.380
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

496
00:34:09.427 --> 00:34:11.895
Actually. they're not funny. They're art.

497
00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:15.183
(Laughing)

498
00:34:16.227 --> 00:34:18.866
OK. let's say. er. Thursday. my place.

499
00:34:18.907 --> 00:34:23.105
Great. I've got Juliet on the other line.
she wants to ask you a favour.

500
00:34:23.147 --> 00:34:27.937
- (Sighing) OK. fine.
- Thanks and. er. be nice.

501
00:34:27.987 --> 00:34:32.902
- I'm always nice.
- 'You know what I mean. Marky. be friendly.'

502
00:34:32.947 --> 00:34:35.222
- I'm always...
- (Juliet) 'Mark? '

503
00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:38.100
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

504
00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:40.820
It was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

505
00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:44.337
- So. what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour.'

506
00:34:44.387 --> 00:34:47.265
I've just tried the wedding video
and it's a disaster.

507
00:34:47.307 --> 00:34:50.265
- 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.'
- I'm sorry.

508
00:34:50.307 --> 00:34:53.856
I remember you filming a lot
and I wondered if I could look at it.

509
00:34:53.907 --> 00:34:55.943
To be honest. I didn't really...

510
00:34:55.987 --> 00:35:00.503
Please. All I want is one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

511
00:35:00.547 --> 00:35:05.302
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it.
so don't get any hopes up.

512
00:35:05.347 --> 00:35:08.100
- 'Must go.'
- (Click)

513
00:35:12.547 --> 00:35:15.266
Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

514
00:35:15.307 --> 00:35:19.095
No. I've done fuck-all and never will
because he's too good for me.

515
00:35:19.147 --> 00:35:21.138
How true.

516
00:35:22.507 --> 00:35:24.498
- (Sarah) Stop.
- (Mobile)

517
00:35:24.547 --> 00:35:26.697
And of course. your mobile goes.

518
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:30.227
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

519
00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:34.065
- So. how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

520
00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:36.223
Think I've found a venue.

521
00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.543
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

522
00:35:39.587 --> 00:35:44.502
It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

523
00:35:46.267 --> 00:35:49.498
Oh. Right.

524
00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:53.586
Good. Well. I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

525
00:35:53.627 --> 00:35:55.663
You should.

526
00:36:03.107 --> 00:36:05.098
(Typewriter clacking)

527
00:36:05.867 --> 00:36:07.858
(Bell tinkles)

528
00:36:13.947 --> 00:36:15.460
Ah. bonjour. Eleonore.

529
00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:18.260
Bonjour. Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

530
00:36:18.307 --> 00:36:20.343
And this year you bring a lady guest?

531
00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:23.504
No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

532
00:36:23.547 --> 00:36:27.825
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

533
00:36:27.867 --> 00:36:30.506
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah. yeah.

534
00:36:30.547 --> 00:36:35.575
Good. Well. I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

535
00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:38.095
This is Aurelia.

536
00:36:38.147 --> 00:36:40.024
Ah.

537
00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:43.980
- Er. bonjour. Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

538
00:36:44.027 --> 00:36:48.976
(French) Er. je suis. er. tr�s heureux
de vous avoir ici.

539
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:53.905
Unfortunately. she cannot speak French.
just like you.

540
00:36:53.947 --> 00:36:55.824
She's Portuguese.

541
00:36:55.867 --> 00:36:58.381
(Italian) Ah. ah. buongiorno.

542
00:36:58.427 --> 00:37:00.304
Eusebio. er. er...

543
00:37:00.347 --> 00:37:02.656
(Pidgin Spanish) Er. molto bueno...

544
00:37:03.867 --> 00:37:08.702
I think she's ten years too young
to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

545
00:37:08.747 --> 00:37:11.056
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

546
00:37:11.107 --> 00:37:12.586
Right.

547
00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:15.300
Anyway. it's nice to meet you and...

548
00:37:15.827 --> 00:37:17.977
Can you drive her home after her work?

549
00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:21.702
Oh. absolutely. yes.
Con-Con grande. er. pl-plesura.

550
00:37:21.747 --> 00:37:23.897
Which is what? Turkish?

551
00:37:31.307 --> 00:37:33.298
(Pidgin Portuguese) Bello.

552
00:37:34.867 --> 00:37:36.858
Er. bella.

553
00:37:37.987 --> 00:37:40.262
Er. mon-montagno.

554
00:37:40.307 --> 00:37:42.298
arvarez...

555
00:37:45.107 --> 00:37:47.575
No. right. Silence is golden.

556
00:37:49.547 --> 00:37:51.663
As the Tremeloes said.

557
00:37:53.427 --> 00:37:55.065
Clever guys.

558
00:37:55.107 --> 00:38:00.181
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

559
00:38:00.227 --> 00:38:02.138
Gr-great band.

560
00:38:02.187 --> 00:38:04.621
(High-pitched humming:
Silence Is Golden)

561
00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:06.976
Oh. shut up.

562
00:38:07.027 --> 00:38:09.302
(Cheering)

563
00:38:17.347 --> 00:38:19.463
(Press) Mr President!

564
00:38:21.147 --> 00:38:23.786
- Over here. sir!
- What will you be talking about?

565
00:38:25.147 --> 00:38:26.785
Mr President. welcome.

566
00:38:26.827 --> 00:38:28.385
It's a pleasure to meet you.

567
00:38:28.427 --> 00:38:31.146
Come through.
I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

568
00:38:31.187 --> 00:38:34.338
So is she. Although she would have been
kind of Ionely.

569
00:38:34.387 --> 00:38:36.378
Yes. Pathetic. isn't it?

570
00:38:36.427 --> 00:38:38.816
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

571
00:38:38.867 --> 00:38:41.427
Not sure that politics and dating go together.

572
00:38:41.467 --> 00:38:44.345
Really? I've never found that.

573
00:38:44.387 --> 00:38:48.665
Yeah. you're still sickeningly handsome.
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

574
00:38:48.707 --> 00:38:53.223
- Very jealous of your plane. by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

575
00:38:53.267 --> 00:38:55.462
Ah. Natalie. Hi.

576
00:38:55.507 --> 00:38:58.146
Morning. ma'am. How's your day so far?

577
00:38:58.187 --> 00:39:00.781
- (Natalie giggles)
- Excellent.

578
00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:06.936
(Sighs) My goodness.
that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

579
00:39:06.987 --> 00:39:08.978
Did you see those pipes?

580
00:39:09.027 --> 00:39:12.099
Yeah. she's terrific. At her job.

581
00:39:12.147 --> 00:39:16.663
No. absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

582
00:39:16.707 --> 00:39:18.538
That is unexpected.

583
00:39:18.587 --> 00:39:20.976
Well. it shouldn't be.

584
00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:24.099
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

585
00:39:24.147 --> 00:39:26.900
We're being consistent with their policies.

586
00:39:26.947 --> 00:39:29.700
With all respect. they were bad policies.

587
00:39:29.747 --> 00:39:32.864
Thanks. Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

588
00:39:32.907 --> 00:39:36.661
Let's. erm... move on. shall we?

589
00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:42.343
Well. now. that was an interesting day.

590
00:39:43.867 --> 00:39:47.746
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today.

591
00:39:47.787 --> 00:39:50.460
then just disappointing you for four years.

592
00:39:50.507 --> 00:39:53.340
I have plans and I plan to see them through.

593
00:39:53.387 --> 00:39:56.345
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.

594
00:39:56.387 --> 00:39:59.504
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

595
00:39:59.547 --> 00:40:02.061
I'll give you anything you ask for.

596
00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:05.099
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

597
00:40:09.627 --> 00:40:11.265
Hi.

598
00:40:11.307 --> 00:40:13.298
Pathetic.

599
00:40:33.147 --> 00:40:36.503
It's great Scotch.

600
00:40:36.547 --> 00:40:40.335
I'II. erm... I'll be going. then.

601
00:40:41.747 --> 00:40:43.977
Er. Natalie.

602
00:40:44.027 --> 00:40:48.782
I hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

603
00:40:48.827 --> 00:40:51.216
Thank you. sir.

604
00:41:06.827 --> 00:41:08.704
Er. yes. Peter.

605
00:41:08.747 --> 00:41:10.942
Mr President. has it been a good visit?

606
00:41:10.987 --> 00:41:14.423
Very satisfactory indeed.

607
00:41:14.467 --> 00:41:17.027
We got what we came for

608
00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:20.457
and our special relationship
is still very special.

609
00:41:20.507 --> 00:41:22.941
Prime Minister?

610
00:41:22.987 --> 00:41:27.344
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins. doesn't it?

611
00:41:27.387 --> 00:41:30.777
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

612
00:41:31.907 --> 00:41:35.866
A relationship based on
the President taking what he wants

613
00:41:35.907 --> 00:41:40.742
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to. erm...

614
00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:45.258
Britain.

615
00:41:45.307 --> 00:41:49.300
We may be a small country
but we're a great one. too.

616
00:41:49.347 --> 00:41:52.464
The country of Shakespeare.
Churchill. the Beatles.

617
00:41:52.507 --> 00:41:55.624
- Sean Connery. Harry Potter.
- (Laughter)

618
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:58.545
- David Beckham's right foot.
- (Laughter)

619
00:41:58.587 --> 00:42:01.181
David Beckham's left foot. come to that.

620
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:05.106
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

621
00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:08.264
And since bullies only respond to strength.
from now onward.

622
00:42:08.307 --> 00:42:11.902
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

623
00:42:11.947 --> 00:42:15.098
And the President
should be prepared for that.

624
00:42:15.147 --> 00:42:17.866
(Press clamouring)

625
00:42:24.547 --> 00:42:26.538
Mr President!

626
00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:31.695
Joe.

627
00:42:32.707 --> 00:42:34.857
It's your sister on line four.

628
00:42:36.147 --> 00:42:40.538
All right. Er. yes. I'm very busy
and important. how can I help you?

629
00:42:40.587 --> 00:42:42.657
Have you gone completely insane?

630
00:42:42.707 --> 00:42:46.302
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

631
00:42:46.347 --> 00:42:49.020
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

632
00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:51.740
- 'I'll call you back.'
- No. you won't!

633
00:42:53.547 --> 00:42:59.224
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

634
00:42:59.267 --> 00:43:02.259
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

635
00:43:02.307 --> 00:43:06.698
What did I do?
I made a papier-m�ch� lobster head.

636
00:43:06.747 --> 00:43:09.215
What is this we're listening to?

637
00:43:09.267 --> 00:43:11.462
Joni Mitchell.

638
00:43:11.507 --> 00:43:14.260
I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

639
00:43:14.307 --> 00:43:17.743
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

640
00:43:19.107 --> 00:43:23.976
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

641
00:43:24.027 --> 00:43:28.066
Did she? Oh. well. that's good.
I must write to her and say thanks.

642
00:43:29.387 --> 00:43:31.582
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

643
00:43:31.627 --> 00:43:35.666
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

644
00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:40.177
(Female DJ) 'It's almost enough
to make you feel patriotic.

645
00:43:40.227 --> 00:43:43.742
'so here's one
for our arse-kicking prime minister.

646
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.381
'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.'

647
00:43:46.427 --> 00:43:48.736
(Pointer Sisters: Jump)
Hold me

648
00:43:48.787 --> 00:43:51.426
I'll give you all that you need

649
00:43:52.467 --> 00:43:55.425
Wrap your love around me

650
00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:59.016
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

651
00:43:59.067 --> 00:44:00.705
Oh baby

652
00:44:00.747 --> 00:44:05.184
I'll take you down. I'll take you down

653
00:44:05.227 --> 00:44:07.502
Where no one's ever gone before

654
00:44:07.547 --> 00:44:09.344
And if you want more

655
00:44:09.387 --> 00:44:14.017
If you want more. more. more

656
00:44:14.067 --> 00:44:16.740
Jump for my love

657
00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.618
Jump in

658
00:44:18.667 --> 00:44:20.385
And feel my touch

659
00:44:20.427 --> 00:44:24.420
Jump. if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then

660
00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:27.027
Jump for my love

661
00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:32.465
I'll take you down. I'll take you down

662
00:44:32.507 --> 00:44:33.940
Where no one's ever gone

663
00:44:33.987 --> 00:44:35.818
- (Music stops)
- Yeah. erm.

664
00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:40.816
Mary. can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

665
00:44:40.867 --> 00:44:44.257
- Certainly. sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

666
00:44:51.347 --> 00:44:53.986
Erm. Would you like the last. er...?

667
00:44:54.027 --> 00:44:56.257
(Portuguese) Thank you very much but no.

668
00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:58.377
If you saw my sister. you'd understand why.

669
00:44:58.427 --> 00:45:00.463
That's all right. more for me.

670
00:45:00.507 --> 00:45:02.623
(Portuguese)
Just don't go eating it all yourself.

671
00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:04.146
you're getting chubbier every day.

672
00:45:04.187 --> 00:45:08.499
I'm very lucky I've got a constitution
where I never put on weight.

673
00:45:08.547 --> 00:45:10.583
(Phone)

674
00:45:10.627 --> 00:45:14.142
- Hello.
- (Ringing continues)

675
00:45:20.667 --> 00:45:23.056
Oop. Sorry.

676
00:45:23.107 --> 00:45:25.177
(Ringing continues)

677
00:45:26.387 --> 00:45:27.945
Hello?

678
00:45:43.227 --> 00:45:45.695
- Thank you.
- (Portuguese) N�o!

679
00:45:45.747 --> 00:45:48.819
- Eu pe�o imensa desculpa.
- Oh. no. Hold on.

680
00:45:48.867 --> 00:45:51.335
- God. it's half the book. Oh. no.
- Que desastre.

681
00:45:51.387 --> 00:45:54.777
Just leave them. please!
They're not important.

682
00:45:54.827 --> 00:45:57.421
They're not worth it!

683
00:45:57.467 --> 00:46:00.300
Stop! Stop.

684
00:46:00.347 --> 00:46:02.861
Aa-ahh.

685
00:46:03.987 --> 00:46:06.103
It's all just rubbish.

686
00:46:07.667 --> 00:46:09.737
Just leave it.

687
00:46:21.147 --> 00:46:24.264
Oh. God. she's in.

688
00:46:24.307 --> 00:46:27.982
And now she'll think I'm a total spaz
if I don't go in too.

689
00:46:29.027 --> 00:46:31.336
(Portuguese) Fuck - it's cold!

690
00:46:34.707 --> 00:46:36.982
Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

691
00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:40.224
(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.

692
00:46:40.787 --> 00:46:43.620
It's not worth it.
this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

693
00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.464
(Portuguese) I don't want to drown

694
00:46:45.507 --> 00:46:48.180
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

695
00:46:48.227 --> 00:46:49.626
Just stop. Stop.

696
00:46:49.667 --> 00:46:52.306
(Portuguese) What kind of idiot
doesn't make copies?

697
00:46:52.387 --> 00:46:54.184
I really must do copies.

698
00:46:55.507 --> 00:46:57.623
There'd better not be eels in here.

699
00:46:57.667 --> 00:47:00.659
(Portuguese) Try not to disturb the eels.

700
00:47:00.707 --> 00:47:02.618
Oh. what the hell is that?

701
00:47:12.427 --> 00:47:14.657
Thank you. Thank you so much.

702
00:47:18.867 --> 00:47:22.257
I know. I'll name
one of the characters after you.

703
00:47:22.307 --> 00:47:26.664
(Portuguese) Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

704
00:47:26.707 --> 00:47:29.744
Or give me 50% of the profits.

705
00:47:29.787 --> 00:47:32.859
Or I could give you 5% of the profits.

706
00:47:35.747 --> 00:47:38.420
(Portuguese) What kind of book is it?

707
00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:48.903
- Romance?
- Yes.

708
00:47:48.947 --> 00:47:51.825
It's. erm...
(Imitates horror film sound effects)

709
00:47:51.867 --> 00:47:53.061
Ah. er...

710
00:47:53.107 --> 00:47:55.257
(Portuguese) Thriller... crime...

711
00:47:55.307 --> 00:47:59.141
(Portuguese) Sim.
(English) Crime. Crime. murder.

712
00:47:59.187 --> 00:48:00.859
(Portuguese) Frightening? (Gasps)

713
00:48:00.907 --> 00:48:03.899
Er. scary? Yes. sometimes scary.

714
00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:08.225
And. er. sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

715
00:48:17.067 --> 00:48:19.422
Mm.

716
00:48:21.227 --> 00:48:24.902
(Portuguese) I'd better get back to work.

717
00:48:24.947 --> 00:48:28.576
- Ah.
- (Portuguese) Later you'll drive me home?

718
00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:30.618
Sure.

719
00:48:33.787 --> 00:48:36.665
It's my favourite time of day...

720
00:48:36.707 --> 00:48:38.698
driving you.

721
00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:45.224
(Portuguese) It's the saddest part
of my day. leaving you.

722
00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.306
Sorry.

723
00:49:18.587 --> 00:49:21.943
(TV) 'And coming up
later this morning. it's this guy... '

724
00:49:21.987 --> 00:49:26.219
There's no beginning. there'll be no end

725
00:49:26.267 --> 00:49:29.896
- Cos on Christmas...
- '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll.

726
00:49:29.947 --> 00:49:32.461
'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'

727
00:49:38.147 --> 00:49:39.978
Banoffee pie?

728
00:49:40.027 --> 00:49:41.745
No. thanks.

729
00:49:41.787 --> 00:49:45.143
Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

730
00:49:45.187 --> 00:49:48.543
Right. well. lucky you.

731
00:49:48.587 --> 00:49:52.341
- Can I come in?
- Er. yeah. well. I'm a bit busy...

732
00:49:52.387 --> 00:49:57.097
I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

733
00:49:57.147 --> 00:49:59.980
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

734
00:50:00.027 --> 00:50:02.222
or maybe Munchies?

735
00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:06.499
Actually. I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

736
00:50:06.547 --> 00:50:09.380
Mark. can I say something?

737
00:50:09.427 --> 00:50:11.418
Yeah.

738
00:50:12.427 --> 00:50:14.861
I know you're Peter's best friend

739
00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:19.856
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

740
00:50:19.907 --> 00:50:22.705
Look. don't. don't argue.

741
00:50:22.747 --> 00:50:25.056
We've never got friendly.

742
00:50:25.107 --> 00:50:27.541
But I wanted to say. I hope that can change.

743
00:50:27.587 --> 00:50:31.500
I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

744
00:50:32.787 --> 00:50:35.301
It would be great if we could be friends.

745
00:50:35.907 --> 00:50:37.898
Absolutely. Absolutely.

746
00:50:41.347 --> 00:50:43.656
Great.

747
00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:46.585
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video. though.

748
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:50.336
I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

749
00:50:50.387 --> 00:50:53.220
This one says
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

750
00:50:53.267 --> 00:50:55.497
Do you think we might be on the right track?

751
00:50:55.547 --> 00:50:59.938
Er. yeah. well... Wow. That-that could be it.

752
00:50:59.987 --> 00:51:02.626
- Do you mind if I...?
- I've probably taped over it.

753
00:51:02.667 --> 00:51:05.659
Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

754
00:51:06.707 --> 00:51:08.698
Oh.

755
00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:12.263
Oh. bingo.

756
00:51:13.827 --> 00:51:15.863
That's lovely.

757
00:51:15.907 --> 00:51:17.977
Well done. you.

758
00:51:19.267 --> 00:51:21.417
Oh. that's gorgeous.

759
00:51:22.787 --> 00:51:26.746
Thank you so much. Mark.
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

760
00:51:33.427 --> 00:51:35.622
I look quite pretty.

761
00:51:42.587 --> 00:51:44.657
You've stayed rather close.

762
00:52:36.547 --> 00:52:38.742
They're all of me.

763
00:52:42.627 --> 00:52:45.664
(Mark) Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:52:45.707 --> 00:52:47.698
Yes.

765
00:53:16.627 --> 00:53:18.538
But...

766
00:53:19.587 --> 00:53:21.703
you never talk to me.

767
00:53:23.987 --> 00:53:25.978
You always talk to Peter.

768
00:53:28.427 --> 00:53:30.543
You don't like me.

769
00:53:31.707 --> 00:53:33.698
I hope it's useful.

770
00:53:33.747 --> 00:53:36.705
Don't show it around too much.

771
00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:39.819
Needs a bit of editing.

772
00:53:39.867 --> 00:53:43.416
Look. I've got to get to a... lunch.

773
00:53:43.467 --> 00:53:45.344
Early lunch.

774
00:53:45.387 --> 00:53:48.220
You can just show yourself out. can't you?

775
00:53:53.667 --> 00:53:57.865
It's a... self-preservation thing. you see.

776
00:54:00.747 --> 00:54:02.738
(Dido: Here With Me)

777
00:54:08.627 --> 00:54:11.585
Oh I am what I am

778
00:54:11.627 --> 00:54:14.460
I'll do what I want

779
00:54:14.507 --> 00:54:19.103
But I can't hide

780
00:54:19.147 --> 00:54:21.217
And I won't go

781
00:54:22.107 --> 00:54:24.826
I won't sleep

782
00:54:24.867 --> 00:54:27.665
And I can't breathe

783
00:54:27.707 --> 00:54:30.665
Until you're resting here with me

784
00:54:30.707 --> 00:54:33.221
And I won't leave

785
00:54:33.267 --> 00:54:35.940
And I can't hide

786
00:54:35.987 --> 00:54:38.706
I cannot be

787
00:54:38.747 --> 00:54:41.261
Until you're resting here

788
00:54:41.307 --> 00:54:44.060
And I won't go

789
00:54:44.107 --> 00:54:46.826
And I won't sleep

790
00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:49.665
And I can't breathe

791
00:54:49.707 --> 00:54:54.019
Until you're resting here with me

792
00:54:54.067 --> 00:54:56.865
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

793
00:54:59.107 --> 00:55:01.985
Annie. my darling. my dream. my boat.

794
00:55:02.907 --> 00:55:05.023
Ah...

795
00:55:05.067 --> 00:55:07.581
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.

796
00:55:07.627 --> 00:55:09.618
Anything for the hero of the hour.

797
00:55:11.347 --> 00:55:14.225
Don't ask me why.
and don't read stuff into this.

798
00:55:14.267 --> 00:55:16.622
it's just a weird personality thing.

799
00:55:16.667 --> 00:55:19.625
But. erm. you know Natalie who works here?

800
00:55:19.667 --> 00:55:22.101
The chubby girl?

801
00:55:22.147 --> 00:55:24.138
Ooh. would we call her chubby?

802
00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:28.658
I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there.
yes. sir. Huge thighs.

803
00:55:29.707 --> 00:55:32.619
Yeah. Well. whatever. erm...

804
00:55:33.707 --> 00:55:37.416
I'm sure she's a lovely girl
but I wonder if you could. erm...

805
00:55:39.907 --> 00:55:42.819
redistribute her?

806
00:55:42.867 --> 00:55:44.858
It's done.

807
00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:20.457
Hey. Sammo. Can't sleep?

808
00:56:21.147 --> 00:56:23.217
I got some terrible news today.

809
00:56:23.267 --> 00:56:25.178
Let's have it.

810
00:56:25.227 --> 00:56:28.185
- Joanna's going back to America.
- Your girl's American?

811
00:56:28.227 --> 00:56:30.661
Yes. she's American.

812
00:56:30.707 --> 00:56:33.016
And she's not my girl.

813
00:56:33.067 --> 00:56:37.026
And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

814
00:56:37.067 --> 00:56:39.183
That is bad news.

815
00:56:41.187 --> 00:56:43.576
Well. we need Kate

816
00:56:43.627 --> 00:56:46.824
and we need Leo. and we need them now.

817
00:56:46.867 --> 00:56:48.619
Come on.

818
00:56:52.147 --> 00:56:54.217
'Hold on. Hold on.

819
00:56:54.267 --> 00:56:56.462
'Keep your eyes closed.

820
00:56:56.507 --> 00:57:00.819
- 'Do you trust me? '
- 'I trust you.'

821
00:57:01.707 --> 00:57:04.221
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

822
00:57:04.267 --> 00:57:06.781
- Fool!
- Get off. you big bully.

823
00:57:09.227 --> 00:57:12.219
'AII right. open your eyes.'

824
00:57:15.227 --> 00:57:18.697
You know. Sammy.
I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary

825
00:57:18.747 --> 00:57:21.625
but general wisdom is that in the end.

826
00:57:21.667 --> 00:57:24.977
there isn't just one person for each of us.

827
00:57:26.027 --> 00:57:28.018
There was for Kate and Leo.

828
00:57:28.067 --> 00:57:30.627
There was for you.

829
00:57:30.667 --> 00:57:32.544
And there is for me.

830
00:57:32.587 --> 00:57:34.498
She's the one.

831
00:57:36.067 --> 00:57:38.865
Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

832
00:57:38.907 --> 00:57:41.979
Yeah. I know. Same as Mum.

833
00:57:51.867 --> 00:57:54.256
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

834
00:57:57.867 --> 00:58:00.859
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

835
00:58:15.387 --> 00:58:18.106
(Pidgin Portuguese)
Oh. Appolo... Erm. appologia.

836
00:58:18.147 --> 00:58:23.175
Grande. er... grande familio.
grande tradizione de Christmas presents.

837
00:58:23.227 --> 00:58:25.218
Stupido.

838
00:58:50.267 --> 00:58:52.861
Well. goodbye.

839
00:58:52.907 --> 00:58:54.943
(Portuguese) Thank you.

840
00:58:57.867 --> 00:59:00.256
Erm. it was. erm...

841
00:59:01.307 --> 00:59:04.219
(Portuguese) I will miss you.

842
00:59:05.467 --> 00:59:08.265
And your very slow typing...

843
00:59:09.307 --> 00:59:12.060
and your very bad driving.

844
01:00:01.267 --> 01:00:03.258
(Car horn)

845
01:00:10.227 --> 01:00:14.266
You know I love Christmas. I always will

846
01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:20.058
My mind's made up. the way that I feel

847
01:00:21.427 --> 01:00:25.818
There's no beginning. there'll be no end

848
01:00:25.867 --> 01:00:30.702
Cos on Christmas you can depend

849
01:00:36.627 --> 01:00:38.618
Daniel!

850
01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:43.580
- I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

851
01:00:43.627 --> 01:00:46.619
- Well. girls love musicians. don't they?
- Uh-huh.

852
01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:49.500
- Even the weird ones get girlfriends.
- That's right.

01:00:49.547 --> 01:00:51.902
Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.

Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.

855
01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:59.546
Whatever. There's this big concert
at the end of term and Joanna's in it.

856
01:00:59.587 --> 01:01:03.262
I thought if I was in the band
and played superbly.

857
01:01:03.307 --> 01:01:06.299
she might fall in love with me.
What do you think?

858
01:01:06.347 --> 01:01:09.100
I think it's brilliant. I think it's stellar.

859
01:01:09.147 --> 01:01:12.901
Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

860
01:01:12.947 --> 01:01:16.144
- I don't play a musical instrument?
- Yes. sir.

861
01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:18.977
A tiny. insignificant detail.

I go out of my mind

865
01:01:27.067 --> 01:01:28.978
I can't see anything

866
01:01:29.027 --> 01:01:31.495
Cos this love's got me blind

867
01:01:31.547 --> 01:01:34.266
I can't help myself

868
01:01:34.307 --> 01:01:35.945
I can't break this spell

869
01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:39.502

So deep I can't sleep. I can't...

874
01:01:55.027 --> 01:01:57.666
I suppose I'd better do the duty round.

875

Yeah. sure. sure.

As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.

880
01:02:17.107 --> 01:02:19.063
Not my boyfriend.

881
01:02:19.107 --> 01:02:21.177

it's gonna be possible

969

Yes. Yes. I'm sure he's very good
at exorcism but...

970
01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:50.256
Well. I'm sure...

971
01:08:50.307 --> 01:08:53.982
Jon Bon Jovi is as well
and I'll definitely look into it.

972
01:08:54.027 --> 01:08:57.463
OK? OK. I'll talk to you later.

973
01:08:57.507 --> 01:08:59.498
All right. bye-bye.

974

- Sorry about that.
- No. it's fine.

- I'm sorry.
- No. it's fine. It's fine.

977
01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:18.898
I mean. it's not really fine. it is what it is.

978
01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:22.462
and there being no parents now
and us being over here.

979
01:09:22.507 --> 01:09:27.706
it's my job to keep an eye on him.
Not my job. obviously. I'm glad to do it...

980
01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:32.377
That's OK. Life is full
of interruptions and complications.

981
01:09:34.867 --> 01:09:36.380
So...

982
01:09:47.787 --> 01:09:49.778
(Mobile)

983
01:09:52.627 --> 01:09:54.618
Will it make him better?

984
01:09:55.947 --> 01:09:57.665
No.

985
01:09:57.707 --> 01:09:59.698
Then maybe...

986
01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:02.418
don't answer.

987
01:10:09.587 --> 01:10:12.055
Hey. How you doing?

Oh. please. please don't. little darling.

990
01:10:18.867 --> 01:10:23.463
Between the two of us we'll find the answer
and it won't hurt any more.

991
01:10:23.507 --> 01:10:25.418
No. no.

992
01:10:25.467 --> 01:10:27.458
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

993
01:10:29.027 --> 01:10:32.224
Of course. if you want me
to come over I will. Mm-hm.

994
01:10:33.867 --> 01:10:35.664
OK.

995
01:10:44.267 --> 01:10:47.020
That was a good night.

996
01:10:47.067 --> 01:10:49.661
- Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

997
01:10:49.707 --> 01:10:51.299
It's true.

998
01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:55.386
Nowadays the only clothes I can get into
were once owned by Pavarotti.

999
01:10:55.427 --> 01:10:58.225
I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.

1000
01:11:01.627 --> 01:11:03.618
Mia's very pretty.

1001
01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.418
Is she?

1002
01:11:08.747 --> 01:11:11.659
You know she is. darling.

1003
01:11:11.707 --> 01:11:13.823
Be careful there.

1004
01:11:36.107 --> 01:11:38.780
Have you been watching stuff on TV?

1005
01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:42.535
Yeah.

1006
01:11:42.587 --> 01:11:44.498
- Every night.
- Good.

1007
01:11:44.547 --> 01:11:46.617
And every day.

1008
01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:58.022
- The nurses are trying to kill me.
- Nobody's trying to kill you. babe.

1009
01:12:03.867 --> 01:12:05.858
Thank you.

1010
01:12:08.467 --> 01:12:10.856
Don't do that. my darling.

1011
01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:15.058
Thank you.

1012
01:12:21.827 --> 01:12:23.897
Don't do that.

Are you gonna get me something?

1016
01:13:02.427 --> 01:13:04.418
Er...

1017
01:13:05.867 --> 01:13:07.858
I don't know. I hadn't thought.

1018
01:13:07.907 --> 01:13:09.704
Where's Sarah. by the way?

1019
01:13:09.747 --> 01:13:12.420
She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

1020
01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:16.062
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

1021
01:13:16.107 --> 01:13:20.100
- See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

1022
01:13:23.347 --> 01:13:25.338
A lot.

1023
01:13:36.907 --> 01:13:39.023
Are you gonna give me something?

1024
01:13:39.987 --> 01:13:42.626
I thought I made it clear last night.

1025
01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:46.262
When it comes to me.
you can have everything.

1026
01:13:46.307 --> 01:13:49.663
So. erm. what do you need?

1027
01:13:50.867 --> 01:13:54.746
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

1028
01:13:54.787 --> 01:13:58.097
No. I don't want something I need.

1029
01:13:58.147 --> 01:14:01.457
I want something I want. Something pretty.

1030
01:14:02.587 --> 01:14:04.418
Right.

1031
01:14:05.467 --> 01:14:07.458
Right.

1032
01:14:14.507 --> 01:14:18.102
Sorry I'm late. I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

1033
01:14:21.827 --> 01:14:24.387
Right. listen. you keep yourself occupied

1034
01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:27.464
while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

1035
01:14:48.507 --> 01:14:50.577
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1036
01:14:50.627 --> 01:14:53.266
Looking for anything in particular. sir?

1037
01:14:53.307 --> 01:14:56.822
Yes. That necklace there. how much is it?

1038
01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:58.983
It's �270.

1039
01:15:00.267 --> 01:15:04.226
- Erm. all right. Er. I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1040
01:15:07.107 --> 01:15:10.099
Would you like it... giftwrapped?

1041
01:15:10.147 --> 01:15:12.820
- Yes. all right.
- Lovely.

1042
01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:17.937
Let me just pop it in the box.

1043
01:15:19.547 --> 01:15:20.946
There.

1044
01:15:20.987 --> 01:15:24.457
- Look. could we be quite quick?
- Certainly. sir.

1045
01:15:24.507 --> 01:15:27.260
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1046
01:15:34.427 --> 01:15:36.019
- There.
- That's great.

1047
01:15:36.067 --> 01:15:38.786
Not quite finished.

1048
01:15:42.147 --> 01:15:46.663
- I don't need a bag. I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh. this isn't a bag. sir.

1049
01:15:46.707 --> 01:15:49.983
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1050
01:15:56.467 --> 01:15:58.423
Ooh!

1051
01:16:12.227 --> 01:16:14.536
Could we be quite quick. please?

1052
01:16:14.587 --> 01:16:17.260
Prontissimo.

1053
01:16:34.787 --> 01:16:37.426
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick. sir.

1054
01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:40.857
- Actually. I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it. sir.

1055
01:16:40.907 --> 01:16:43.102
Want to bet?

1056
01:16:43.147 --> 01:16:45.502
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1057
01:16:48.827 --> 01:16:51.022
There we go. Almost finished.

1058
01:16:51.067 --> 01:16:55.379
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1059
01:16:55.427 --> 01:16:58.419
No. sir. we're going to pop it
in the Christmas box.

1060
01:16:58.467 --> 01:17:00.025
I don't want a Christmas box.

1061
01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:02.740
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1062
01:17:02.787 --> 01:17:04.505
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1063
01:17:04.547 --> 01:17:07.186
- All we need now...
- Oh. God.

1064
01:17:07.227 --> 01:17:09.343
...is a sprig of holly.
- No. no. no. no.

1065
01:17:09.387 --> 01:17:11.343
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1066
01:17:11.387 --> 01:17:13.981
- Leave it.
- Ooh!

1067
01:17:14.027 --> 01:17:17.861
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1068
01:17:17.907 --> 01:17:20.467
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1069
01:17:20.507 --> 01:17:24.022
after 13 years of
Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

1070
01:17:24.067 --> 01:17:26.058
Actually. I do love this one.

1071
01:17:26.107 --> 01:17:28.223
(Darlene Love: All Alone On Christmas)

1072
01:17:28.267 --> 01:17:30.383
I've gotta know

1073
01:17:30.427 --> 01:17:36.343
Where do the Ionely hearts go...

1074
01:17:36.387 --> 01:17:39.618
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1075
01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:42.579
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

1076
01:17:42.627 --> 01:17:45.858
You're not actually going ahead
with this stupid plan?

1077
01:17:45.907 --> 01:17:47.579
I bloody am.

1078
01:17:47.627 --> 01:17:50.824
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1079
01:17:50.867 --> 01:17:53.825
It is chock-a-block full of condoms.

1080
01:17:53.867 --> 01:17:57.177
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect. keep that going.

1081
01:17:57.227 --> 01:17:59.422
(Clears throat) Look. erm...

1082
01:18:00.707 --> 01:18:03.175
sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...

1083
01:18:03.227 --> 01:18:07.698
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink.
do you? I mean. nothing implied.

1084
01:18:07.747 --> 01:18:13.140
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1085
01:18:13.187 --> 01:18:16.384
Obviously. if you don't want to.
you don't have to. I...

1086
01:18:16.427 --> 01:18:18.099
I'm rambling now. sorry.

1087
01:18:18.147 --> 01:18:20.741
No. That would be lovely.

1088
01:18:20.787 --> 01:18:23.062
Oh. great.

1089
01:18:25.307 --> 01:18:26.581
Yay!

1090
01:18:26.627 --> 01:18:28.697
You know. that is really great.

1091
01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:33.502
Normally. I'm really shy. takes me ages
to get the courage up. so thank you.

1092
01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:35.617
(Repetitive drumbeats)

1093
01:18:39.787 --> 01:18:44.941
- Explain again why you're so late.
- Can't a man have any secrets?

1094
01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:49.060
We've been waiting for hours.
it's the first ever preview.

1095
01:18:49.107 --> 01:18:51.098
...is a thing of the past

1096
01:18:51.147 --> 01:18:54.423
Maybe you can bring us all hope this year

1097
01:18:54.467 --> 01:18:57.345
Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared...

1098
01:18:57.387 --> 01:19:01.300
(Karen) It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1099
01:19:01.347 --> 01:19:04.419
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1100
01:19:12.187 --> 01:19:15.736
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1101
01:19:15.787 --> 01:19:18.699
(Russian) Is this the way to the train station?

1102
01:19:18.747 --> 01:19:21.784
I would like half-pint of churly.

1103
01:19:22.827 --> 01:19:25.421
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1104
01:19:25.467 --> 01:19:29.096
(Portuguese) Oh. my God.
I've got a terrible stomachache.

1105
01:19:29.147 --> 01:19:31.342
It must have been the prawns.

1106
01:19:31.387 --> 01:19:33.821
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1107
01:19:34.947 --> 01:19:38.986
(Portuguese) My goodness.
this is a very big fish!

1108
01:19:39.027 --> 01:19:41.939
It tastes delicious!

1109
01:19:41.987 --> 01:19:43.625
All alone on Christmas

1110
01:19:43.667 --> 01:19:46.227
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1111
01:19:46.267 --> 01:19:50.055
All alone on Christmas
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1112
01:19:50.107 --> 01:19:51.586
Tell me I've got to know

1113
01:19:51.627 --> 01:19:56.143
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Don't leave me alone

1114
01:19:56.187 --> 01:20:00.783
- You'll come back a broken man.
- Yeah. back broken from too much sex.

1115
01:20:00.827 --> 01:20:03.102
You are on the road to disaster.

1116
01:20:03.147 --> 01:20:06.503
No. I am on shag highway. heading west.

1117
01:20:07.067 --> 01:20:08.978
Farewell. failure.

1118
01:20:09.027 --> 01:20:12.815
America. watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1119
01:20:12.867 --> 01:20:16.303
And he's got a big knob

1120
01:20:17.347 --> 01:20:20.180
(Santana Featuring Rob Thomas:
Smooth)

1121
01:20:26.587 --> 01:20:29.055
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1122
01:20:29.107 --> 01:20:32.383
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.

1123
01:20:33.107 --> 01:20:35.905
(On jukebox) Man. it's a hot one

1124
01:20:35.947 --> 01:20:39.144
Like seven inches
from the midday sun...

1125
01:20:39.187 --> 01:20:42.816
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like a Budweiser. please.

1126
01:20:42.867 --> 01:20:46.143
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1127
01:20:47.027 --> 01:20:49.222
Oh. my God.

1128
01:20:49.267 --> 01:20:51.098
Are you from England?

1129
01:20:52.667 --> 01:20:55.022
- Yes.
- Oh...

1130
01:20:55.067 --> 01:20:57.945
that is so cute.

1131
01:20:57.987 --> 01:21:01.536
Hi. I'm Stacey. (Giggles)

1132
01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:03.578
Jeannie?

1133
01:21:05.387 --> 01:21:07.423
Yeah?

1134
01:21:07.467 --> 01:21:10.140
- This is...
- Colin.

1135
01:21:11.587 --> 01:21:13.737
Frissell.

1136
01:21:13.787 --> 01:21:15.823
Cute name.

1137
01:21:15.867 --> 01:21:18.586
- Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1138
01:21:18.627 --> 01:21:20.777
Yep. Basildon.

1139
01:21:20.827 --> 01:21:23.625
- Oh.
- Oh.

1140
01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:28.422
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
She's crazy about English guys.

1141
01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.537
(Stacey) Uh-huh.

1142
01:21:33.467 --> 01:21:37.301
- Hey. girls.
- Carol-Anne. come meet Colin.

1143
01:21:37.347 --> 01:21:39.861
He's from England.

1144
01:21:39.907 --> 01:21:43.980
Well. step aside. ladies. This one's on me.

1145
01:21:46.987 --> 01:21:49.455
- Hey. gorgeous.
- (Gentle growl)

1146
01:21:51.147 --> 01:21:53.183
That is so funny!

1147
01:21:54.467 --> 01:21:56.742
- What do you call that?
- Er. bottle.

1148
01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.823
(With English accent) "Bottle."

1149
01:21:58.867 --> 01:22:00.858
- What about this?
- Er. straw.

1150
01:22:00.907 --> 01:22:02.704
(Girls) "Straw."

1151
01:22:02.747 --> 01:22:04.658
- What about this?
- Table.

1152
01:22:05.867 --> 01:22:07.858
- Table. The same.
- Oh. it's the same.

1153
01:22:07.907 --> 01:22:11.183
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1154
01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:13.946
I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1155
01:22:13.987 --> 01:22:17.184
Oh. my God. Oh. my God. that is so cute.

1156
01:22:17.227 --> 01:22:21.778
No. no. no. listen. This may be a bit pushy
cos we just met you but...

1157
01:22:21.827 --> 01:22:24.261
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1158
01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:26.377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1159
01:22:26.427 --> 01:22:29.305
Well. if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1160
01:22:29.347 --> 01:22:32.259
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1161
01:22:32.307 --> 01:22:34.343
What?

1162
01:22:34.387 --> 01:22:37.902
Well. we're not the richest of girls.
you know.

1163
01:22:37.947 --> 01:22:42.737
So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1164
01:22:42.787 --> 01:22:46.018
So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1165
01:22:46.067 --> 01:22:52.256
And on this cold. cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1166
01:22:52.307 --> 01:22:54.980
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1167
01:22:55.027 --> 01:22:57.336
No?

1168
01:22:57.387 --> 01:22:59.821
Which means...

1169
01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:01.983
we would be naked.

1170
01:23:06.467 --> 01:23:08.059
No. no. I think it'd be fine.

1171
01:23:08.107 --> 01:23:10.416
- (Girls) Great.
- Erm...

1172
01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:13.459
The thing that's gonna make it
more crowded...

1173
01:23:13.507 --> 01:23:15.623
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1174
01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:17.464
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1175
01:23:17.507 --> 01:23:21.659
Don't worry. you're totally gonna like her
cos she is "the sexy one".

1176
01:23:21.707 --> 01:23:24.380
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1177
01:23:24.427 --> 01:23:28.136
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh. and he's a Christian.

1178
01:23:30.507 --> 01:23:32.099
(AIl) Cheers.

1179
01:23:32.147 --> 01:23:34.581
If I could

1180
01:23:34.627 --> 01:23:36.697
Then I would

1181
01:23:36.747 --> 01:23:40.786
I'll go wherever you will go

1182
01:23:40.827 --> 01:23:42.783
Way up high

1183
01:23:42.827 --> 01:23:44.818
Or down low

1184
01:23:44.867 --> 01:23:48.906
I'll go wherever you will go

1185
01:23:48.947 --> 01:23:52.223
If I could turn back...

1186
01:23:52.267 --> 01:23:55.384
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1187
01:23:55.427 --> 01:23:57.338
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1188
01:23:57.387 --> 01:24:00.424
- I'll get it.
- No. no. no. I want to choose mine.

1189
01:24:00.467 --> 01:24:02.662
I think I want...

1190
01:24:04.747 --> 01:24:08.376
...this one.
- I have bought the traditional scarf as well

1191
01:24:08.427 --> 01:24:12.215
but this is my other.
slightly special. personal one.

1192
01:24:12.267 --> 01:24:14.337
Thank you.

1193
01:24:14.387 --> 01:24:16.423
That's a real first.

1194
01:24:16.467 --> 01:24:18.822
- Rip it!
- What is it?

1195
01:24:18.867 --> 01:24:21.335
I'm going to... All right. I'll rip it.

1196
01:24:27.627 --> 01:24:29.936
God. that's a surprise.

1197
01:24:31.147 --> 01:24:32.865
(Daisy) What is it?

1198
01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:38.216
It's a CD. Joni Mitchell. wow.

1199
01:24:38.267 --> 01:24:40.542
To continue your emotional education.

1200
01:24:40.587 --> 01:24:42.703
Yes.

1201
01:24:42.747 --> 01:24:45.136
Goodness.

1202
01:24:45.187 --> 01:24:47.098
That's great.

1203
01:24:47.147 --> 01:24:49.980
- My brilliant wife.
- Ah. yes.

1204
01:24:52.147 --> 01:24:56.299
Actually. do you mind if I just absent myself
for a second?

1205
01:24:56.347 --> 01:24:59.145
All that ice cream. Er...

1206
01:24:59.187 --> 01:25:02.338
Darling. could you make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1207
01:25:02.387 --> 01:25:05.379
- Back in a minute.
- (Harry to kids) All right. take it easy.

1208
01:25:05.747 --> 01:25:07.624
(Bernie) Mine first. Mine.

1209
01:25:08.027 --> 01:25:10.700
(Joni Mitchell: Both Sides Now)
Moons and Junes

1210
01:25:10.747 --> 01:25:13.056
And Ferris wheels

1211
01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:19.495
The dizzy dancing way that you feel

1212
01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:24.416
As every fairy tale comes real

1213
01:25:26.707 --> 01:25:29.096
I've looked at love that way

1214
01:25:32.587 --> 01:25:36.102
But now it's just another show

1215
01:25:38.227 --> 01:25:42.618
And you leave 'em laughing when you go

1216
01:25:43.947 --> 01:25:46.586
And if you care

1217
01:25:46.627 --> 01:25:48.743
Don't let them know

1218
01:25:50.467 --> 01:25:53.584
Don't give yourself away

1219
01:25:56.267 --> 01:25:58.497
I've looked at love

1220
01:25:58.547 --> 01:26:01.345
From both sides now

1221
01:26:01.387 --> 01:26:03.423
From give and take

1222
01:26:04.587 --> 01:26:07.659
And still somehow

1223
01:26:07.707 --> 01:26:12.735
It's love's illusions that I recall

1224
01:26:14.547 --> 01:26:16.902
I really don't know love

1225
01:26:21.027 --> 01:26:23.666
I really don't know love at all

1226
01:26:34.907 --> 01:26:37.102
Tears and fears

1227
01:26:37.147 --> 01:26:39.866
And feeling proud

1228
01:26:40.907 --> 01:26:45.776
To say I love you right out loud

1229
01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:49.421
Dreams and schemes

1230
01:26:49.467 --> 01:26:52.186
And circus crowds

1231
01:26:53.467 --> 01:26:56.425
I've looked at life that way

1232
01:26:57.827 --> 01:26:59.943
Oh but now old friends...

1233
01:26:59.987 --> 01:27:01.579
Oh. my God.

1234
01:27:01.627 --> 01:27:04.585
It's a miracle. You're all dressed.

1235
01:27:04.627 --> 01:27:07.585
Come on. come on. come on.
we're horribly late.

1236
01:27:07.627 --> 01:27:09.982
Come on. then. In the car. In the car.

1237
01:27:11.147 --> 01:27:13.866
Well something's lost

1238
01:27:13.907 --> 01:27:15.704
But something's gained

1239
01:27:17.067 --> 01:27:20.264
In living every day

1240
01:27:20.507 --> 01:27:23.465
- Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

1241
01:27:23.507 --> 01:27:27.978
But the thing about romance is people
only get together right at the very end.

1242
01:27:28.027 --> 01:27:30.143
Of course.

1243
01:27:31.187 --> 01:27:34.896
By the way. I feel bad. I never ask you
how your love life is going.

1244
01:27:34.947 --> 01:27:36.858
Er-huh!

1245
01:27:36.907 --> 01:27:38.659
No.

1246
01:27:38.707 --> 01:27:41.540
As you know.
that was a done deal long ago.

1247
01:27:42.787 --> 01:27:47.577
Unless Claudia Schiffer calls. in which case
I want you out of here straightaway.

1248
01:27:47.627 --> 01:27:50.744
- you wee motherless mongrel.
- Oh!

1249
01:27:50.787 --> 01:27:54.496
No. no. We'll want to have sex
in every room. including yours.

What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at Elton John's.

1358
01:35:03.107 --> 01:35:08.101
Well. I was there for a minute or two
and then I had an epiphany.

1359
01:35:08.147 --> 01:35:10.456
- Really?
- Yeah.

1360
01:35:10.507 --> 01:35:12.543
Come on. Just come up.

1361
01:35:12.587 --> 01:35:15.624
So what was this epiphany?

1362
01:35:15.667 --> 01:35:18.340
Erm. it... it was about Christmas.

1363
01:35:18.387 --> 01:35:20.582
You realised it was all around.

1364
01:35:20.627 --> 01:35:24.859
No. I realised that Christmas is the time
to be with the people you love.

1365
01:35:25.907 --> 01:35:27.386
Right.

1366
01:35:27.427 --> 01:35:33.980
And I realised that. as dire chance
and fateful cockup would have it.

1367
01:35:34.027 --> 01:35:35.983
here I am.

1368
01:35:36.027 --> 01:35:38.257
mid-fifties.

1369
01:35:38.307 --> 01:35:41.379
and without knowing it.
I've spent most of my adult life

1370
01:35:41.427 --> 01:35:45.102
with a chubby employee. (Snorts)

1371
01:35:45.147 --> 01:35:47.786
And. much as it grieves me to say it.

1372
01:35:47.827 --> 01:35:53.379
it might be that the people I love is. in fact...

1373
01:35:54.427 --> 01:35:57.225
you.

1374
01:35:58.267 --> 01:36:00.303
Well. this is a surprise.

1375
01:36:00.347 --> 01:36:02.099
Yeah.

1376
01:36:02.147 --> 01:36:04.342
Ten minutes at Elton John's and you're gay?

1377
01:36:04.387 --> 01:36:06.378
No. look. I'm serious here.

1378
01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:12.059
I left Elton's and a hefty number
of half-naked chicks with their mouths open

1379
01:36:12.107 --> 01:36:16.259
in order to hang out with you at Christmas.

1380
01:36:17.747 --> 01:36:22.980
- Well. Bill...
- It's a terrible. terrible mistake. chubs...

1381
01:36:26.627 --> 01:36:29.858
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1382
01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:36.941
And to be honest.
despite all my complaining...

1383
01:36:38.747 --> 01:36:41.102
we have had a wonderful life.

1384
01:36:45.427 --> 01:36:47.065
Well...

1385
01:36:48.787 --> 01:36:50.903
thank you.

1386
01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:55.419
I mean. come on. it's been an honour.

1387
01:36:56.867 --> 01:36:59.176
I feel very proud.

1388
01:36:59.227 --> 01:37:01.297
Oh. look. don't be a moron.

1389
01:37:09.187 --> 01:37:11.701
(Clears throat)

1390
01:37:11.747 --> 01:37:15.057
Come on. let's get pissed and watch porn.

1391

about the thing that happened.

1394
01:37:42.027 --> 01:37:45.019
'It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.

1395
01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.898
'Particularly because -

1396
01:37:46.947 --> 01:37:49.620
'if you can't say it at Christmas.
when can you. eh? -

1397
01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:53.296
'I'm actually yours. With love. your Natalie.'

1398

(Pointer Sisters: Jump)

1401
01:38:27.707 --> 01:38:29.982
Oh. don't wait up.

1402
01:38:33.547 --> 01:38:35.822
I'd like to go to Wandsworth. the dodgy end.

1403
01:38:35.867 --> 01:38:38.017
Very good. sir.

1404

I can feel it in your heart beat

1406
01:38:45.227 --> 01:38:48.105
I know you like what you see...

1407
01:38:48.147 --> 01:38:50.980
(Terry) Harris Street. What number. sir?

1408
01:38:51.027 --> 01:38:55.737
(David) Oh. God. it's the longest street
in the world and I have absolutely no idea.

1409
01:38:55.787 --> 01:38:58.620
Wrap your love around me

1410
01:38:58.667 --> 01:39:01.545

1423
01:39:41.427 --> 01:39:43.224
Well. I suppose I could.

On the feast of Stephen

1428
01:39:57.307 --> 01:40:00.663
(Joins in with rich. deep voice)
When the snow lay round about

1429
01:40:00.707 --> 01:40:04.017
Deep and crisp and even

1430
01:40:04.067 --> 01:40:07.457
Brightly shone the moon that night

1431
01:40:07.507 --> 01:40:09.975
- (Doorbell)

1432

1433
01:40:12.947 --> 01:40:15.017
She lives next door.

1434
01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:19.901
Ah. Brilliant.

1435
01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:22.825
You're not who I think you are. are you?

1436
01:40:22.867 --> 01:40:24.903
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1437
01:40:24.947 --> 01:40:28.257
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

Oh. where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1443
01:40:54.667 --> 01:40:58.421
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1444
01:40:58.467 --> 01:41:03.382
Erm. this is my mum and my dad
and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1445
01:41:03.427 --> 01:41:05.304
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1446
01:41:05.347 --> 01:41:09.022
And. erm... this is the Prime Minister.

Yes. we can see that. darling.

1448
01:41:11.907 --> 01:41:14.626
And erm. unfortunately. we're very late.

1449
01:41:14.667 --> 01:41:17.659
It's the school Christmas concert.
you see. David.

1450
01:41:17.707 --> 01:41:21.017
All the local schools have joined together.
even St Basil's...

1451
01:41:21.067 --> 01:41:24.776
- Too much detail. Mum.
- Anyway. how can we help. sir?

1452
01:41:24.827 --> 01:41:28.581
Well. I... just needed Natalie...

1453
01:41:31.227 --> 01:41:33.218
on some state business.

1454
01:41:33.267 --> 01:41:37.704
- Oh.
- Right. yes. Of course.

1455
01:41:37.747 --> 01:41:39.465
Right. er...

1456
01:41:39.507 --> 01:41:42.146
Well. perhaps you should
come on later. Plumpy.

1457
01:41:42.187 --> 01:41:43.540
Er. Natalie.

1458
01:41:43.587 --> 01:41:46.021
I don't want to make you late for the concert.

1459
01:41:46.067 --> 01:41:49.582
- No. it's nothing. really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1460
01:41:49.627 --> 01:41:53.620
- No. really. it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1461
01:41:53.667 --> 01:41:55.623
Eight is a lot of legs. David.

1462
01:41:55.667 --> 01:41:58.101
Mm. Erm...

1463
01:41:59.827 --> 01:42:01.863
Listen. why don't I give you a lift

1464
01:42:01.907 --> 01:42:06.822
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car.

1465
01:42:08.307 --> 01:42:09.786
OK.

1466
01:42:09.827 --> 01:42:12.580
- Lovely. yes.
- Thank you.

1467
01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:14.663
Hold tight. everybody.

1468
01:42:20.987 --> 01:42:23.706
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1469
01:42:23.747 --> 01:42:26.341
Ah. right. Well. er...

1470
01:42:28.187 --> 01:42:30.337
I just wanted to say...

1471
01:42:32.187 --> 01:42:34.257
thank you for the Christmas card.

1472
01:42:34.307 --> 01:42:36.059
You're welcome.

1473
01:42:36.107 --> 01:42:37.984
Look. I'm so sorry about that day.

1474
01:42:38.027 --> 01:42:41.224
I came in and he slinked towards me
and there was a fire

1475
01:42:41.267 --> 01:42:45.579
and he's the President of the United States
and nothing happened. I promise.

1476
01:42:45.627 --> 01:42:48.664
I just felt like such a fool because...

1477
01:42:48.707 --> 01:42:51.858
I think about you all the time. actually.

1478
01:42:51.907 --> 01:42:55.183
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1479
01:42:55.227 --> 01:42:56.819
...Iove.
- Oh. wow.

1480
01:42:56.867 --> 01:42:59.427
That really was just round the corner. Er...

1481
01:43:01.067 --> 01:43:03.058
Erm...

1482
01:43:05.427 --> 01:43:07.577
Ow!

1483
01:43:11.587 --> 01:43:13.782
(Sighs)

1484
01:43:13.827 --> 01:43:16.022
Well. look. I...

1485
01:43:17.707 --> 01:43:20.141
I think I'd better not come in. you know?

1486
01:43:21.067 --> 01:43:24.503
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1487
01:43:24.547 --> 01:43:28.017
No. please come. It'll be great.

1488
01:43:28.067 --> 01:43:30.661
No. I'd... I'd better not.

1489
01:43:31.707 --> 01:43:36.337
But I will be very sorry

1490
01:43:36.387 --> 01:43:38.423
to drive away from you.

1491
01:43:39.827 --> 01:43:41.943
Just give me one second.

1492
01:43:55.307 --> 01:43:58.344
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1493
01:43:58.387 --> 01:44:01.379
- Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1494
01:44:04.347 --> 01:44:06.338
No!

1495
01:44:36.387 --> 01:44:39.902
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1496
01:44:39.947 --> 01:44:42.063
OK. Terry. I won't be long.

1497
01:44:45.387 --> 01:44:48.185
Look. this has to be a very secret visit. OK?

1498
01:44:48.227 --> 01:44:52.220
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1499
01:44:54.827 --> 01:44:57.944
Look. the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1500
01:44:57.987 --> 01:45:01.866
- Oh. David.
- Ah!

1501
01:45:01.907 --> 01:45:04.137
Oh. how are you?

1502
01:45:04.187 --> 01:45:08.100
Hi. guys. Hey. hey. hey. You all right?

1503
01:45:08.147 --> 01:45:10.217
What the hell are you doing here?

1504
01:45:10.267 --> 01:45:13.179
- Well. you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1505
01:45:13.227 --> 01:45:17.778
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1506
01:45:17.827 --> 01:45:19.658
I thought it was time I did.

1507
01:45:19.707 --> 01:45:22.983
I didn't want anyone to see.
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1508
01:45:23.027 --> 01:45:25.382
Good luck. Daisy. good luck. Bernie.

1509
01:45:25.427 --> 01:45:29.022
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1510
01:45:29.067 --> 01:45:32.218
- Thank you.
- All right.

1511
01:45:32.267 --> 01:45:35.100
Oh. now. We haven't been introduced.

1512

20 years ago. you'd have been his type.

1519
01:45:51.427 --> 01:45:56.182
I'll be very careful. Don't try something. sir.

Catch a falling star

Save it for a rainy day

1527

01:47:06.507 --> 01:47:09.977
(A capella) I don't want a lot for Christmas

1541
01:47:10.027 --> 01:47:14.179
There's just one thing I need

1542
01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:17.424
I don't care about the presents

1543
01:47:17.467 --> 01:47:21.221
Underneath the Christmas tree

1544
01:47:21.267 --> 01:47:24.782
I just want you for my own

1545
01:47:24.827 --> 01:47:28.502
More than you could ever know

1546
01:47:28.547 --> 01:47:32.335
Make my wish come true

1547
01:47:32.387 --> 01:47:36.380
All I want for Christmas

1548
01:47:36.427 --> 01:47:43.822
Is you

1549
01:47:45.787 --> 01:47:48.301
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1550
01:47:48.347 --> 01:47:51.544
There's just one thing I need

1551
01:47:51.587 --> 01:47:54.465
I don't care about the presents

1552
01:47:54.507 --> 01:47:57.579
Underneath the Christmas tree

1553
01:47:57.627 --> 01:48:00.824
I just want you for my own

1554
01:48:00.867 --> 01:48:03.700
More than you could ever know

1555
01:48:03.747 --> 01:48:06.739
Make my wish come true

1556
01:48:06.787 --> 01:48:11.303
All I want for Christmas is you

1557
01:48:12.867 --> 01:48:15.097
You baby

1558
01:48:15.147 --> 01:48:18.901
Oh. all the lights are shining

1559
01:48:18.947 --> 01:48:22.906
So brightly everywhere

1560
01:48:22.947 --> 01:48:26.576
And the sound of children's laughter
fills the air

1561
01:48:26.627 --> 01:48:28.936
Laughter fills the air

1562
01:48:28.987 --> 01:48:31.820
Everyone is singing
Oh yeah

1563
01:48:31.867 --> 01:48:34.176
I hear those sleigh bells ringing

1564
01:48:34.227 --> 01:48:36.946
Santa won't you bring me my honey

1565
01:48:36.987 --> 01:48:40.343
Won't you please bring my baby to me

1566
01:48:40.387 --> 01:48:43.220
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1567
01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:46.657
This is all I'm asking for
All I'm asking for

1568
01:48:46.707 --> 01:48:49.540
I just wanna see my baby

1569
01:48:49.587 --> 01:48:52.624
Standing right outside my door

1570
01:48:52.667 --> 01:48:55.261
Cos I just want you for my own

1571
01:48:55.307 --> 01:48:58.504
More than you could ever know
You will ever know

1572
01:48:58.547 --> 01:49:01.778
Make my wish come true

1573
01:49:01.827 --> 01:49:05.820
All I want for Christmas

1574
01:49:05.867 --> 01:49:09.337
Is you

1575
01:49:09.387 --> 01:49:11.617
All I want for Christmas

1576
01:49:11.667 --> 01:49:15.057
And you and you

1577
01:49:15.107 --> 01:49:17.905
And you and you
All I want for Christmas

1578
01:49:18.747 --> 01:49:22.183
All I want for Christmas

1579
01:49:22.227 --> 01:49:24.502
(Cheering. whistling)

1580
01:49:37.747 --> 01:49:39.658
Right.

1581
01:49:42.507 --> 01:49:44.816
So. not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

1582
01:49:44.867 --> 01:49:47.062
- What do we do now?
- Smile.

1583
01:49:48.107 --> 01:49:50.098
Little bow.

1584
01:49:53.347 --> 01:49:55.417
And a wave.

1585
01:50:08.187 --> 01:50:11.304
Absolutely no idea.
I mean. can you imagine?

1586
01:50:11.347 --> 01:50:13.383
I'll see you later. all right?

1587
01:50:13.427 --> 01:50:15.497
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1588
01:50:17.827 --> 01:50:21.820
Tell me. if you were in my position.
what would you do?

1589
01:50:21.867 --> 01:50:23.858
What position is that?

1590
01:50:23.907 --> 01:50:27.502
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1591
01:50:27.547 --> 01:50:30.539
and. come Christmas.
gave it to somebody else.

1592
01:50:30.587 --> 01:50:33.260
- Oh. Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1593
01:50:33.307 --> 01:50:35.867
- Good night.
- Night. darling. Happy Christmas.

1594
01:50:35.907 --> 01:50:38.785
Would you wait around to find out
if it's just a necklace

1595
01:50:38.827 --> 01:50:41.136
or if it's sex and a necklace

1596
01:50:41.187 --> 01:50:44.736
or if. worst of all. it's a necklace and love?

1597
01:50:45.947 --> 01:50:50.896
Would you stay? Knowing life
would always be a little bit worse?

1598
01:50:50.947 --> 01:50:54.303
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh. God.

1599
01:50:58.707 --> 01:51:01.426
I am so in the wrong.

1600
01:51:01.467 --> 01:51:03.458
A classic fool.

1601
01:51:03.507 --> 01:51:06.579
Yes. but you've also made a fool out of me.

1602
01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:09.380
You've made the life I lead foolish. too.

1603
01:51:11.667 --> 01:51:14.545
Darling. Ooh. darlings!

1604
01:51:14.587 --> 01:51:17.659
Oh. you were wonderful.

1605
01:51:17.707 --> 01:51:20.619
My little lobster. you were so...

1606
01:51:20.667 --> 01:51:22.897
What is that word?

1607
01:51:22.947 --> 01:51:25.097
Orange.

1608
01:51:25.147 --> 01:51:28.105
Come on. I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1609
01:51:29.507 --> 01:51:34.058
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming. son.

1610
01:51:34.107 --> 01:51:38.020
- Thanks. Plan didn't work. though.
- Tell her. then.

1611
01:51:38.067 --> 01:51:39.898
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1612
01:51:39.947 --> 01:51:42.780
No way. Anyway. they fly tonight.

1613
01:51:42.827 --> 01:51:47.947
Even better. Sam. you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1614
01:51:49.467 --> 01:51:51.617
I never told your mum enough.

1615
01:51:51.667 --> 01:51:55.945
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1616
01:51:57.027 --> 01:52:01.145
You've seen the films. kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1617
01:52:03.027 --> 01:52:07.578
OK. Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1618
01:52:07.627 --> 01:52:09.857
Yes.

1619
01:52:09.907 --> 01:52:12.137
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1620
01:52:13.627 --> 01:52:16.380
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1621
01:52:16.427 --> 01:52:18.497
That's OK.

1622
01:52:18.547 --> 01:52:21.857
- My fault.
- No. no. really. it wasn't.

1623
01:52:21.907 --> 01:52:24.705
You're Sam's dad. aren't you?

1624
01:52:24.747 --> 01:52:27.545
Yeah. Stepdad. actually.

1625
01:52:27.587 --> 01:52:30.306
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1626
01:52:30.347 --> 01:52:32.065
Carol.

1627
01:52:32.107 --> 01:52:36.339
- OK. I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1628
01:52:37.667 --> 01:52:39.897
I hope we'll meet again. Karen.

1629
01:52:39.947 --> 01:52:42.097
Carol. (Laughs)

1630
01:52:43.387 --> 01:52:47.824
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1631
01:52:49.387 --> 01:52:51.378
(Carol laughs)

1632
01:52:55.347 --> 01:52:57.338
- Tell her.
- What?

1633
01:52:57.387 --> 01:53:00.299
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1634
01:53:03.787 --> 01:53:05.823
- Look. there she is.
- Where?

1635
01:53:05.867 --> 01:53:08.062
Over there.

1636
01:53:09.827 --> 01:53:11.783
Oh. no.

1637
01:53:12.827 --> 01:53:15.705
It's OK. we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1638
01:53:30.267 --> 01:53:32.303
(Portuguese) Good evening.

1639
01:53:32.347 --> 01:53:35.259
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1640
01:53:35.307 --> 01:53:38.856
I am here to ask your daughter

1641
01:53:38.907 --> 01:53:40.784
for her hands in marriage.

1642
01:53:40.827 --> 01:53:42.977
You want to marry my daughter?

1643
01:53:43.027 --> 01:53:44.858
Yes.

1644
01:53:44.907 --> 01:53:46.306
Come here.

1645
01:53:46.347 --> 01:53:47.826
there is a man at the door.

1646
01:53:49.347 --> 01:53:51.463
He wants to marry you.

1647
01:53:51.507 --> 01:53:52.826
But I've never seen him before.

1648
01:53:52.867 --> 01:53:54.220
Who cares?

1649
01:53:54.267 --> 01:53:56.417
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1650
01:53:56.467 --> 01:53:59.379
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1651
01:53:59.427 --> 01:54:03.978
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1652
01:54:04.027 --> 01:54:07.622
She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.

1653
01:54:07.667 --> 01:54:09.100
You! Stay here.

1654
01:54:09.147 --> 01:54:11.980
As if I would. Stupid!

1655
01:54:14.787 --> 01:54:19.383
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1656
01:54:23.027 --> 01:54:25.018
Wait. Wait.

1657
01:54:28.227 --> 01:54:29.580
Oh. no.

1658
01:54:31.027 --> 01:54:32.824
You better not say yes. Father.

1659
01:54:32.867 --> 01:54:35.745
Shut up. Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1660
01:54:40.667 --> 01:54:44.137
- Look. we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1661
01:54:44.187 --> 01:54:48.419
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1662
01:54:50.067 --> 01:54:51.944
No.

1663
01:54:53.947 --> 01:54:57.019
- I'm sorry. Sam.
- Boarding pass. sir?

1664
01:54:57.067 --> 01:55:00.503
Just a moment. I know I've got it.
Would you hang on to that?

1665
01:55:00.547 --> 01:55:02.503
- Unless...
- What?

1666
01:55:02.547 --> 01:55:05.015
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1667
01:55:05.067 --> 01:55:07.501
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1668
01:55:08.107 --> 01:55:11.099
- OK.
- Yes!

1669
01:55:11.147 --> 01:55:15.345
I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1670
01:55:31.827 --> 01:55:34.466
(Beeping)

1671
01:56:14.627 --> 01:56:17.141
(Inaudible through glass)

1672
01:56:18.267 --> 01:56:20.576
(Chattering excitedly)

1673
01:56:25.187 --> 01:56:27.701
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1674
01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:29.863
Cool!

1675
01:57:02.707 --> 01:57:04.698
Joanna.

1676
01:57:05.707 --> 01:57:07.698
Sam?

1677
01:57:10.787 --> 01:57:14.905
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1678
01:57:14.947 --> 01:57:18.496
Oh. Jesus. Here. I've gotta run.

1679
01:58:08.867 --> 01:58:11.335
- (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1680
01:58:11.387 --> 01:58:13.343
This man wants to marry her.

1681
01:58:13.387 --> 01:58:16.026
He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1682
01:58:34.187 --> 01:58:35.905
Boa noite. Aurelia.

1683
01:58:37.387 --> 01:58:39.378
Boa noite. Jamie.

1684
01:58:54.067 --> 01:58:56.945
Beautiful Aurelia...

1685
01:58:56.987 --> 01:59:01.026
I've come here with a view to asking you...

1686
01:59:02.067 --> 01:59:04.183
to marriage me.

1687
01:59:05.467 --> 01:59:10.097
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1688
01:59:11.667 --> 01:59:18.379
but sometimes things are so transparency.

1689
01:59:19.627 --> 01:59:22.903
they don't need evidential proof.

1690
01:59:24.747 --> 01:59:30.504
And I will inhabit here.
or you can inhabit with me in England.

1691
01:59:30.547 --> 01:59:32.981
Definitely go for England. girl.

1692
01:59:33.027 --> 01:59:36.178
You'll meet Prince William -
then you can marry him instead.

1693
01:59:37.147 --> 01:59:42.904
Of course I don't expecting you
to be as foolish as me.

1694
01:59:43.747 --> 01:59:48.263
and of course I prediction you say no...

1695
01:59:49.307 --> 01:59:56.895
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to... check.

1696
02:00:00.947 --> 02:00:04.417
Oh. God - say yes. you skinny moron.

1697
02:00:07.107 --> 02:00:09.098
(English) Thank you.

1698
02:00:10.827 --> 02:00:12.818
That will be nice.

1699
02:00:14.987 --> 02:00:17.660
Yes is being my answer.

1700
02:00:19.267 --> 02:00:21.497
Easy question.

1701
02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:23.902
(Portuguese) What did you say?

1702
02:00:23.947 --> 02:00:25.266
Yes. of course.

1703
02:00:25.507 --> 02:00:27.862
(Cheering)

1704
02:00:27.907 --> 02:00:30.137
Bravo!

1705
02:00:54.467 --> 02:00:56.537
(English) You learned English?

1706
02:00:57.027 --> 02:00:59.143
Just in cases.

1707
02:01:14.947 --> 02:01:17.745
(Beach Boys: God Only Knows)

1708
02:01:31.347 --> 02:01:34.066
I may not always love you

1709
02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:38.343
But long as there are stars above you...

1710
02:01:38.387 --> 02:01:39.786
Hello. Daisy.

1711
02:01:39.827 --> 02:01:42.660
- This one's Greta.
- Hello. Greta.

1712
02:01:42.707 --> 02:01:44.982
I'll make you so sure about it...

1713

Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1714
02:01:48.947 --> 02:01:51.984
- Mark. didn't see you there.
- Just thought I'd tag along.

1715
02:01:52.027 --> 02:01:54.860
Jamie's friends are so good-Iooking.

1716
02:01:54.907 --> 02:01:57.102
He never tells me this.

1717
02:01:57.147 --> 02:02:00.184
I think maybe now
I have made the wrong choice.

1718
02:02:00.227 --> 02:02:01.865
picked wrong Englishman.

1719
02:02:01.907 --> 02:02:04.023

Can't deny the joy it brings

02:05:04.187 --> 02:05:07.463
A dozen roses. diamond rings
