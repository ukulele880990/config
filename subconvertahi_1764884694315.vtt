00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.441
You can't keep
punishing yourself. Boyd.

3
00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:05.772
She wouldn't have wanted that.

4
00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:07.741
And I wish you had
the luxury of grief.

5
00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:10.447
but you don't.
These people need you.

6
00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:12.944
I knew all about the divorce
and how this whole trip

7
00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.385
was just one last hurrah

8
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.288
before you sat us down
to break the news.

9
00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:19.489
Thomas is dead!
You have two other kids!

10
00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:21.326
Why aren't we enough for you?

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.300
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

12
00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:36.440
Seriously. man. I don't know why
you keep staring at that thing.

13
00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:39.212
Yeah. there's two pages
stuck together here.

14
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.006
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

15
00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.749
Holy shit.

16
00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:50.784
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

17
00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.588
She showed me this.

18
00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:54.887
Something was
watching me that day.

19
00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.427
the same thing that told Sara--

20
00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:58.759
And you think this thing
is trying to help us?

21
00:00:58.794 --> 00:01:00.827
Whatever it is. it's a part
of the fabric of this place.

22
00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:03.368
They're in the house!
They're inside!

23
00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.639
Follow protocol!

24
00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:12.707
Find your buddy.
get into the van!

25
00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:13.708
Ellis! We have to
get back in the house!

26
00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:16.546
We have to get inside!
I have an idea. Come on!

27
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.584
Please. please. please. please!

28
00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.618
We have to go.

29
00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:25.016
Go where?
Where are we going?

30
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.589
You go first.

31
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:28.492
I'll follow you down.

32
00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:30.626
We need to get to town.

33
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:32.364
No. We have to go to the trees.

34
00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:33.530
You're crazy.

35
00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.598
You have to get inside.

36
00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.369
-The tree? No! No!
-You'll be safe!

37
00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:38.601
-What?
-I promise.

38
00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.471
Find your brother.
You have to tell him.

39
00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:42.539
I'll be right behind you!

40
00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.480
No!
No. come here!

41
00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.814
Stay with me.

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:17.068
Hey. Sheriff?

44
00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.575
Yep.

45
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.710
In a sec.

46
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:29.984
I got. uh--

47
00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.083
I got most of the Colony House
residents squared away.

48
00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.558
Most people in town aren't
really using their basements.

49
00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:36.989
so each house is
gonna take two or three.

50
00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.562
Some are at the clinic and. uh.

51
00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:41.092
the last three are gonna
stay with me and my mom...

52
00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:44.029
and Jade. I guess.

53
00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.965
Okay.

54
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.067
Feels like things are starting
to get tense out there.

55
00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.575
People are already
boarding up their windows.

56
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.841
and with Colony House and
the town living together now.

57
00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:56.877
I think maybe we should get
everyone gathered together

58
00:02:56.912 --> 00:02:59.418
and. I don't know.
say something?

59
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.046
It's a good idea.

60
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:04.016
You should do that.

61
00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.888
I think it would mean
a lot more coming from you.

62
00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.462
Right.

63
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.761
Right.

64
00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.369
Are you okay?

65
00:03:17.735 --> 00:03:19.999
He saved my life.
You know that?

66
00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:23.035
Father Khatri.
the night we got into town.

67
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.609
he risked his own life
to make sure that...

68
00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:30.449
-Give everyone my regards.
-Wait. Where are you going?

69
00:03:30.484 --> 00:03:31.681
I got something to do.
It's important.

70
00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.452
More important than this?

71
00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:36.719
Sheriff. the people
need you right now.

72
00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:38.655
-They need to hear that--
-What?

73
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.591
They need to hear what?

74
00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:42.692
Everything's gonna be okay?
That God's got a plan.

75
00:03:42.727 --> 00:03:44.793
Look. if you're gonna be
the sheriff when I'm gone.

76
00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:47.026
you're gonna need to start
figuring out how to say things

77
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.502
like that for yourself
and sound halfway convincing.

78
00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:53.406
You'll do fine.

79
00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:17.694
Let's take a walk.

80
00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:37.603
-Come on!

81
00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:39.836
-Listen to those lyrics.

82
00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:42.036
Listen to how
peaceful that sounds.

83
00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:45.941
The man is riding
a pony on an ocean.

84
00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:49.879
You know why?
'Cause he has a boat.

85
00:06:49.914 --> 00:06:52.343
Doesn't matter how many times
you listen to the song.

86
00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:54.081
still can't afford
to buy a boat.

87
00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:56.820
Yeah. look. all I'm saying is
if we manage the payments--

88
00:06:56.855 --> 00:06:58.756
Oh. we're gonna
manage the payments?

89
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.956
-Yeah!
-Right.

90
00:07:00.991 --> 00:07:03.156
So. is not paying the payments
one of the management options?

91
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:05.928
Because that's
the option we'd be taking.

92
00:07:05.963 --> 00:07:08.095
Yeah. I'm pretty sure most
lenders frown on that option.

93
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.361
Yeah. yeah. Listen.
nobody's talking to you.

94
00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.968
-All right? Nobody.

95
00:07:13.003 --> 00:07:15.267
You know what they used
to call e in the army. right?

96
00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:16.741
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

97
00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:18.710
That's right!
That's right! That's right!

98
00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:19.978
They'd send me to
any base to set it up.

99
00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:22.813
and no matter what they gave me.
no matter what the resources.

100
00:07:22.848 --> 00:07:24.881
I would make it work.
Yes. sir. that's right.

101
00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:26.080
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

102
00:07:26.115 --> 00:07:27.181
...Loaves.

103
00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:29.754
Yeah. but. you know. didn't
they call mom Iron Abby?

104
00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:31.789
They certainly did.
And don't you forget it.

105
00:07:31.824 --> 00:07:34.660
Yeah. yeah.
I hear you.

106
00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:37.355
The problem with iron is...
rigid.

107
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.963
So. sometimes. you know.
it doesn't know when to bend.

108
00:07:40.998 --> 00:07:41.764
Uh-huh.

109
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:45.330
Babe... Babe...
all I'm saying.

110
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.299
all I'm saying is. a boat.

111
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:50.940
you know. wouldn't be
a bad retirement gift.

112
00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.843
In case you
needed some ideas

113
00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:56.440
on how to help me. you know.
smooth my transition

114
00:07:56.475 --> 00:08:00.818
from a long and decorated
military career to. you know.

115
00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:03.150
this strange and mysterious
civilian life.

116
00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:06.153
And a boat-- Babe. what are--
what are you looking for?

117
00:08:06.188 --> 00:08:08.419
My-my Chapstick. I can't
find anything in this bag.

118
00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.894
Can you hold this for me?

119
00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:13.226
Sure.
What is-- Is--

120
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:16.262
This--
This looks like a boat key.

121
00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:18.132
-What?
-What?

122
00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:20.937
Yeah. why am I holding
a-a boat key?

123
00:08:20.972 --> 00:08:23.038
-Wait. did you buy the boat?

124
00:08:23.073 --> 00:08:24.974
-Oh. shit.

125
00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:27.174
Of course we
bought you a boat!

126
00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:29.242
-Oh. snap!
-If I had to listen to that man

127
00:08:29.277 --> 00:08:31.310
sing about Tonto and
his pony one more time.

128
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.048
I'd throw myself into traffic.

129
00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.918
-Oh. snap!
-Happy retirement. Dad!

130
00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:36.821
You bought me a boat. baby!

131
00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:38.053
-Thank you!
-Dad!

132
00:08:38.088 --> 00:08:40.121
Oh!

133
00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:50.428
Oh. God.

134
00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.942
Please.

135
00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:01.373
can you just tell me
where we're going?

136
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.177
Where's Father Khatri?

137
00:09:05.082 --> 00:09:07.951
They used to shriek.
Did you know that?

138
00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:12.483
All night long. they'd shriek.
Drove people crazy.

139
00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:15.926
That all stopped
once we got the talismans.

140
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.125
Then they started to whisper.

141
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.391
I always wondered about that.

142
00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:22.031
Your voices tell you
anything about that?

143
00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:24.398
No.

144
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:27.806
'Course not. God forbid
they tell you anything useful.

145
00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.875
Keep walking.

146
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.845
Not until you
tell me what's going on.

147
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.176
You think you're
gonna stand there

148
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:37.046
and make demands
after what you did?

149
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:38.245
Where is Father Khatri?

150
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.280
He's dead!

151
00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:41.853
What?

152
00:09:41.888 --> 00:09:43.250
Those things got
into Colony House.

153
00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:46.957
Father Khatri tried to help.
Now he's dead.

154
00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:49.421
along with a lot
of other people.

155
00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.797
Is Ellis okay?

156
00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:57.132
He's fine.
He's scraped up.

157
00:09:57.167 --> 00:10:00.366
He's back at the clinic
with the others.

158
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.270
Oh. now you wanna cry.

159
00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:06.108
You cry like that
for Bing Qian?

160
00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:08.374
You think I'm a monster.

161
00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.442
I don't give
two shits what you are.

162
00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:13.115
The only reason you're alive
is because Father Khatri

163
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.985
thought you could
help us all get home.

164
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.415
The second you prove him wrong.

165
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.583
I'm gonna put
a bullet in you myself.

166
00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.827
Now. keep walking.

167
00:10:23.193 --> 00:10:25.193
-Where are we going?
-I said keep walking!

168
00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:37.568
So. I'll make up some beds
for you in the basement.

169
00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:40.373
Uh. bathroom's in the back and
feel free to use the kitchen.

170
00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:42.177
but you've gotta
respect the rations.

171
00:10:42.212 --> 00:10:44.311
It won't be the most
comfortable thing in the world.

172
00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.049
but we should have Colony House
back up

173
00:10:46.084 --> 00:10:47.578
and running pretty soon. so...

174
00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:49.481
What the fuck is this?

175
00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:52.319
Uh. we're gonna have a few more
house guests for a little while.

176
00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:56.290
And how little
is a little while?

177
00:10:56.325 --> 00:10:59.062
Aren't you the guy that thought
this was a giant escape room?

178
00:10:59.097 --> 00:11:00.965
How'd that work out for you?

179
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.164
-Fuck off.
-Okay.

180
00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.067
All right.
this is bullshit. okay?

181
00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:05.937
They chose the flower.
They don't belong here.

182
00:11:05.972 --> 00:11:07.103
Dude. why don't
you just--

183
00:11:07.138 --> 00:11:08.599
All right.
any of you guys know Victor?

184
00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:11.338
All right. where's he squatting?
I need to find him.

185
00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:13.241
I saw him running
towards the woods

186
00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:14.979
with the Matthews
girl last night.

187
00:11:15.014 --> 00:11:17.344
Fantastic.
See what a little intercommunity

188
00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:20.215
cooperation can do?
Kumbay-fucking-ya!

189
00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:23.317
Let's get inside.

190
00:11:23.352 --> 00:11:25.583
That guy's
the fuckin' worst.

191
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.487
I don't--
I don't even understand.

192
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:31.193
It was like one second everyone
was having such a good time--

193
00:11:31.228 --> 00:11:33.360
How-- How did you
get out of the house?

194
00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:37.133
I was-- I was up in
Victor's room and we--

195
00:11:37.168 --> 00:11:39.102
No. It...

196
00:11:39.137 --> 00:11:41.236
-It wasn't like that. We were...
-Julie...

197
00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:43.271
No. he was stacking
all of these.

198
00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:45.372
and it looked like he was
getting ready to leave.

199
00:11:45.407 --> 00:11:47.638
And then.
when the screaming started.

200
00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:50.146
we climbed out his window.

201
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:51.983
and he said we had
to go to the forest.

202
00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:54.953
And then. we ran to this tree
and then he pushed me inside--

203
00:11:54.988 --> 00:11:56.581
-Hey.
-And I...

204
00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.352
He said it was starting.

205
00:11:58.387 --> 00:12:00.024
What was starting?

206
00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:02.125
I don't know. He...

207
00:12:05.097 --> 00:12:07.262
All I know is. one second.
I was in a tree.

208
00:12:07.297 --> 00:12:10.463
and the next. I was in a
giant cabinet in a root cellar.

209
00:12:10.498 --> 00:12:11.662
How is that possible?

210
00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:14.434
You went through a Farway Tree!

211
00:12:14.469 --> 00:12:16.271
Huh?

212
00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:19.604
Victor said you can
go all sorts of places.

213
00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:23.410
And sometimes people
go to different places.

214
00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:25.676
So. maybe he went
somewhere else.

215
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.480
We have to find him!

216
00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:30.483
One step at a time.
Hey. Julie...

217
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.388
Jules...
Hey. Jules.

218
00:12:36.458 --> 00:12:37.996
Julie...

219
00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:42.363
What's happening to us?
What--?

220
00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:44.365
-Honey...
-What is going on?

221
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.498
What's happening?

222
00:12:45.533 --> 00:12:47.335
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

223
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.140
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

224
00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:52.307
Hey. hey. No.

225
00:12:53.442 --> 00:12:55.310
Jules. we're gonna be fine.
Breathe.

226
00:12:56.478 --> 00:12:58.082
I know.
Everything's gonna be okay.

227
00:12:58.117 --> 00:13:00.018
-Yes.
-No! How can you say that?

228
00:13:00.053 --> 00:13:02.218
What part of this is okay?

229
00:13:02.253 --> 00:13:04.319
Honey. oh my God.
Just...

230
00:13:04.354 --> 00:13:07.388
Ah. Good. you're here.
Have you seen Victor?

231
00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:08.689
-Hey!
-One of the squatters

232
00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:11.425
at my house said you ran off to
the woods with him last night!

233
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.360
Ow! Ow!

234
00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:13.658
Hey!
I need to talk to her!

235
00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:16.430
What is wrong with you?!

236
00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.366
Do you have any idea
what she has been through?

237
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:20.533
Look. believe me. I get it.
Times are tough all around.

238
00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:23.074
But I found
something last night!

239
00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:27.342
There is this symbol that
I've been-- I've been seeing.

240
00:13:27.377 --> 00:13:29.113
The same symbol is in this book.

241
00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:30.741
And last night. okay.
last night.

242
00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.215
I found this photo!

243
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.777
I don't give a shit
about your questions

244
00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.614
and your symbol and your books.

245
00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.254
Just stay the fuck away
from my daughter.

246
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:40.421
You understand me?

247
00:13:42.227 --> 00:13:46.757
Okay. you're doing the whole
protective dad thing.

248
00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:48.363
I respect that.

249
00:13:48.398 --> 00:13:51.399
You dragged me out
into the woods.

250
00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:54.567
have me climb a fuckin' tree
for some stupid idea.

251
00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.536
and then you
run off like a psycho

252
00:13:56.571 --> 00:13:58.373
before we even have
a chance to try it.

253
00:13:58.408 --> 00:14:02.146
Yeah. uh.
I'm sorry about that...

254
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:03.609
It worked.

255
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.613
-Wait. What?
-Yeah.

256
00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:11.485
All I got was some static.
but it worked.

257
00:14:14.424 --> 00:14:16.391
I think if we get it
up over the tree line.

258
00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:17.755
and we get it enough power.

259
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.559
I think we could
get a signal out.

260
00:14:19.594 --> 00:14:20.627
Wait. wait. wait.

261
00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:23.365
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

262
00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:27.402
We start by going
to the high ground.

263
00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.186
Jesus. That's grim.

264
00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:50.623
Where are
all the people?

265
00:14:50.658 --> 00:14:52.262
I mean...

266
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.627
Wait!

267
00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:56.695
-Whoa. Boyd!
-Jesus!

268
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.533
Hey!
Hey. hey. back up!

269
00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:01.799
Back up!

270
00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.307
You tryin' to get
yourself killed?

271
00:15:04.342 --> 00:15:06.111
I need you to
listen to me. please.

272
00:15:06.146 --> 00:15:08.179
Okay?
There isn't much time.

273
00:15:08.214 --> 00:15:11.842
Now. this is gonna
sound very. very strange.

274
00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.448
and you're not
gonna believe me.

275
00:15:13.483 --> 00:15:15.450
and I wouldn't
believe me either. Okay?

276
00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:17.386
And I wish there was
more time to explain.

277
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.190
But if you don't come
with me right now.

278
00:15:19.225 --> 00:15:21.456
you're all going to die.

279
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:24.195
-Oh...
-Okay. whoa. whoa. whoa. Mom.

280
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.197
Mom. what the hell
are you doing?

281
00:15:26.232 --> 00:15:28.199
Okay. you have a gun.
That is good.

282
00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:31.400
And you're welcome to keep it
pointed at me the entire time.

283
00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:35.305
But I am begging you.
please come with me.

284
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.374
Go on.
Drive away. Drive away.

285
00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:40.178
No. no. no. no. Please.

286
00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:45.843
What the hell was that?

287
00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.812
That was death.

288
00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:50.419
and it's coming...
right now.

289
00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:54.753
Please.

290
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.238
Let's go.

291
00:16:18.317 --> 00:16:21.384
You can put that thing away now.

292
00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:23.452
The only things that are
gonna hurt you are out there.

293
00:16:23.487 --> 00:16:25.784
and that thing's not gonna
make a damn bit of difference

294
00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.258
if they find us.

295
00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:33.198
Look. I know you
all have questions.

296
00:16:33.934 --> 00:16:38.236
And. I promise. we will talk
when the sun comes up.

297
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.287
-Okay.
-Ah...

298
00:16:56.322 --> 00:16:57.387
-Here we go. all right?
-Okay.

299
00:16:57.422 --> 00:16:58.553
-Nice and slow.
-Okay.

300
00:16:58.588 --> 00:16:59.884
It's gonna hurt a bit.
Just breathe.

301
00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:02.227
-Yeah.
-Good. good. good.

302
00:17:02.262 --> 00:17:02.953
-There we go.

303
00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.295
-Breathe.

304
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.824
Good.
Breathe. breathe. breathe.

305
00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.529
Relax. Down. Good.

306
00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:08.992
Okay. see?
Good as new.

307
00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:10.268
Yeah.

308
00:17:10.303 --> 00:17:11.698
-All right.
-Yeah.

309
00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.502
Just gonna put a sling on here.

310
00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:14.833
Can I help with anything?

311
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.341
Make sure
he doesn't get out of bed. Okay?

312
00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:18.573
I don't want you going anywhere

313
00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:21.444
until I can give you
a solid once-over.

314
00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:22.973
-Yeah.
-All right?

315
00:17:24.284 --> 00:17:25.745
Here we go. You good?

316
00:17:27.386 --> 00:17:28.748
Be back in
a second. okay?

317
00:17:28.783 --> 00:17:30.717
Thank you.

318
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.324
Hey.

319
00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:34.820
Busy day for you.

320
00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:36.789
Uh. yeah. we're
a little short-handed.

321
00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:38.362
What can I do?

322
00:17:38.397 --> 00:17:39.594
Well. I could use some help

323
00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:40.795
getting this place
a bit more secure.

324
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.466
It's gonna be a full house
tonight. given what happened.

325
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.336
-So...
-Yeah. of course.

326
00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:47.404
Oh. I. um...

327
00:17:47.439 --> 00:17:50.737
I. uh...
I finished Chapter 6. It's...

328
00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:52.706
Things are starting
to get interesting.

329
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:53.872
Yeah. I don't think
it's gonna be

330
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.709
much of a reading
night tonight. but. uh.

331
00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:57.447
yeah. I'll try to check it out.

332
00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:58.745
Cool.

333
00:18:02.322 --> 00:18:04.256
Thanks. Deputy.

334
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.271
Donna.

335
00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:31.943
You got a minute?

336
00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:34.385
How's Julie?

337
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.717
She's okay.

338
00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:38.389
She's. uh...

339
00:18:38.424 --> 00:18:40.655
But that--
that's not why I'm here.

340
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.020
We came because
we need your help.

341
00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.054
With what?

342
00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:48.091
We wanna build a tower

343
00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:49.763
and we wanna
put it on the roof.

344
00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:50.664
What?

345
00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:52.403
We think if we can
get it high enough.

346
00:18:52.438 --> 00:18:55.571
we could
broadcast a signal

347
00:18:55.606 --> 00:18:57.672
that anyone else
in the area could hear.

348
00:18:57.707 --> 00:19:00.510
And what area
is that exactly?

349
00:19:00.545 --> 00:19:04.107
Look. whatever
this place is.

350
00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:07.880
wherever this place is.

351
00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:10.652
radio signals work
in ways that we can't.

352
00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:13.919
And we already got a strong
indication that this could work.

353
00:19:15.593 --> 00:19:18.055
Well...
We got a little static.

354
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.827
C--Colony House

355
00:19:20.862 --> 00:19:23.764
is the highest point
on the highest hill.

356
00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:26.063
And if we build a tower
and we put it up there.

357
00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.604
we could broadcast out a signal
that could get up over

358
00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:32.410
any interference
from the forest canopy.

359
00:19:34.744 --> 00:19:37.382
Sure.

360
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:41.551
You're okay with this?

361
00:19:41.586 --> 00:19:44.818
You know how many people
died here last night?

362
00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.656
Fourteen.

363
00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:51.957
Those things killed
14 of my people.

364
00:19:51.992 --> 00:19:56.159
There are pieces of them
lying all over this hill.

365
00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:59.899
And I don't think the others
are coming back any time soon.

366
00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:05.542
So. we might as well use
the house for something.

367
00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:10.646
Keep going.

368
00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:15.981
Wait right there.

369
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.497
Let's go.

370
00:20:34.837 --> 00:20:36.672
You're gonna sit tight here.

371
00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:39.136
I'll be back before dark.

372
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:43.877
I've got a few things in town
to wrap up before we head out.

373
00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:45.450
Head out where?

374
00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:47.947
Find our way home.

375
00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:50.983
You won't need those.

376
00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:54.184
I'm not going anywhere.

377
00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.725
I wanna help.

378
00:20:57.827 --> 00:21:00.828
All I've ever
wanted to do is help.

379
00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:03.160
There's nothing to
chain you to here anyway.

380
00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:04.898
If you run--

381
00:21:04.933 --> 00:21:06.702
I understand.

382
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.576
I'll be back.

383
00:21:52.552 --> 00:21:54.651
My God.

384
00:21:57.722 --> 00:22:00.250
Boyd.

385
00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.626
Here. Come on.

386
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.008
Welcome to your
worst nightmare.

387
00:22:22.043 --> 00:22:23.647
Look.

388
00:22:23.682 --> 00:22:28.619
it's a--
it's a lot to unpack.

389
00:22:28.654 --> 00:22:31.853
Just take it slow.

390
00:22:31.888 --> 00:22:34.988
I'll explain more
at the diner.

391
00:22:35.023 --> 00:22:37.188
At the what?

392
00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:39.696
The diner.
It's. uh...

393
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:41.698
Meet me over there.

394
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.705
Hey.
You okay?

395
00:22:51.237 --> 00:22:53.908
No. not really.

396
00:22:53.943 --> 00:22:56.647
That's what you people
do every night here?

397
00:22:56.682 --> 00:22:59.980
Here?
You hide and pray?

398
00:23:00.015 --> 00:23:04.314
Well. there's really
not much else we can do.

399
00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:07.922
And you don't know
anything else about this place?

400
00:23:07.957 --> 00:23:10.089
Who built it?
How long's it been here?

401
00:23:10.124 --> 00:23:14.797
Look. what we know
is what you see.

402
00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:17.965
And the people here.

403
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.739
they just-- they're just tryin'
to live through the night.

404
00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:25.907
Doesn't give us much time
for anything else.

405
00:23:28.714 --> 00:23:30.010
You gotta start
working together.

406
00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:32.683
That's a little
easier said than done.

407
00:23:32.718 --> 00:23:33.849
Yeah. Right.

408
00:23:33.884 --> 00:23:36.786
So. you start small. right?

409
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:38.689
Gather your resources.

410
00:23:38.724 --> 00:23:41.923
create a system. making sure
everybody's covered at night.

411
00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:44.024
Nobody hides
in the same place twice.

412
00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:46.026
You gotta get
these people to start

413
00:23:46.061 --> 00:23:48.633
looking out for each other.
taking care of each other.

414
00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:51.966
and then. you build from there.

415
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.135
Okay.

416
00:23:57.743 --> 00:24:00.909
But where do we start?

417
00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:04.748
All right.

418
00:24:04.783 --> 00:24:07.311
Once we have
everything inventoried.

419
00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:09.786
we're gonna start
rationing it out.

420
00:24:09.821 --> 00:24:12.151
Donna here is
in charge of resupply.

421
00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:14.692
So. you need anything.
you go see her.

422
00:24:14.727 --> 00:24:16.826
Abby is gonna be
drawing up a system

423
00:24:16.861 --> 00:24:18.256
for where we spend
the nights.

424
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:20.159
We're gonna start
digging up some new spots.

425
00:24:20.194 --> 00:24:22.425
make sure we are
constantly rotating.

426
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.735
Let's not make it easy
for these things.

427
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.265
Come on.
What do you got?

428
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.135
All right.

429
00:24:42.722 --> 00:24:44.656
Hey.

430
00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.187
What are you doing?

431
00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:53.060
Are you hungry?

432
00:24:54.833 --> 00:24:57.196
No. Not really.

433
00:25:04.975 --> 00:25:07.173
Have you eaten anything?

434
00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:12.684
I don't know. No.

435
00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:17.854
I'm gonna make you some food.

436
00:25:17.889 --> 00:25:20.285
Are you and Dad still
getting a divorce?

437
00:25:22.223 --> 00:25:24.256
I. uh...

438
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.798
I really don't have an answer
for you right now.

439
00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:29.767
It's a simple question.

440
00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:34.838
It's not
that simple. honey.

441
00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:42.747
Hey. Hey.

442
00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.850
You said you loved each other.

443
00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:51.316
We do.

444
00:25:52.858 --> 00:25:55.056
Then why?

445
00:25:55.091 --> 00:25:56.794
-Is it me?
-No.

446
00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:58.059
Did I do something wrong?

447
00:25:58.094 --> 00:26:00.226
Oh. God. no.
No. no. no. No.

448
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:03.328
No. honey. you didn't
do anything wrong. Don't...

449
00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:04.934
No.

450
00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.874
Listen.

451
00:26:12.372 --> 00:26:16.308
There are things that
you'll only understand

452
00:26:16.343 --> 00:26:19.047
when you become a parent.

453
00:26:19.082 --> 00:26:22.512
One of those things...

454
00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.822
is that you live
for your children.

455
00:26:28.124 --> 00:26:33.193
Your only job is-- is
to love them and protect them.

456
00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:41.168
So when Thomas died...

457
00:26:43.238 --> 00:26:45.370
something inside of me broke.

458
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:52.784
And I have
no idea how to fix it.

459
00:26:59.386 --> 00:27:01.793
I keep reliving that day.

460
00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:06.325
It was just
such a normal day.

461
00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:11.132
You and Ethan were
in the next room.

462
00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:12.837
Your Dad and I
were in the kitchen.

463
00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:16.071
and Thomas was in his changing
table right between us.

464
00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:30.283
Then the phone rang.

465
00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:34.089
I reached for the diaper

466
00:27:34.124 --> 00:27:36.421
and your father reached
for the phone and...

467
00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:43.461
we just turned for one second...

468
00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:46.068
just one fucking second...

469
00:27:46.103 --> 00:27:49.071
and he rolled off the table.

470
00:27:57.246 --> 00:28:00.852
Your father
is the love of my life.

471
00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:07.023
But sometimes I see him and...

472
00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:13.491
I hear
that fucking phone ring.

473
00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:17.363
Why didn't you tell me that?

474
00:28:20.973 --> 00:28:24.337
Because no matter
how grown up you are.

475
00:28:24.372 --> 00:28:27.208
you're always
gonna be my little girl.

476
00:28:31.115 --> 00:28:33.247
So we pretended...

477
00:28:36.351 --> 00:28:38.384
yeah. that everything was fine.

478
00:28:40.993 --> 00:28:43.158
I think that just made
everything worse.

479
00:28:47.395 --> 00:28:49.197
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:53.630
I'm sorry. too.

481
00:29:02.014 --> 00:29:03.442
Let us in!

482
00:29:06.348 --> 00:29:10.416
There's gonna be trouble if you
don't move outta the way!

483
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:12.220
-Let us in!
-Hey. hey. hey. hey!

484
00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:13.683
What the hell's going on?!

485
00:29:15.093 --> 00:29:16.422
Tom. Eli.
what the hell are you doing?

486
00:29:16.457 --> 00:29:18.721
We got people from Colony House
in our houses.

487
00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:20.261
using our supplies!

488
00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:21.395
If I gotta choose between me

489
00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:23.726
and some asshole from
Colony House raiding this place.

490
00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:26.333
-then it's gonna be me!
-Nobody's raiding anything!

491
00:29:26.368 --> 00:29:27.601
Well. those things weren't
supposed to be able

492
00:29:27.636 --> 00:29:30.975
to get into Colony House either.
and look how that turned out!

493
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.471
-Exactly.
-Alright. So then. you guys--

494
00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:34.341
you just wanna
throw it all away?

495
00:29:34.376 --> 00:29:36.409
Start acting like animals
and make it all worse?

496
00:29:36.444 --> 00:29:38.642
Look. we're gonna
figure this out.

497
00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:42.151
Just-- just go home.

498
00:29:42.186 --> 00:29:45.088
Just go home. please.

499
00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:56.429
They... scared.

500
00:29:56.464 --> 00:29:58.068
Yeah.

501
00:30:08.245 --> 00:30:11.015
Those things come out at night.

502
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.250
They walking around in
the forest during the daytime?

503
00:30:15.285 --> 00:30:18.121
Not as far as we can tell.

504
00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:21.091
There might be
resources out there.

505
00:30:21.126 --> 00:30:23.456
We go scavenging
during the daytime.

506
00:30:23.491 --> 00:30:26.162
never know what
we might find.

507
00:30:26.197 --> 00:30:29.198
Yeah.
Good luck findin' volunteers.

508
00:30:29.233 --> 00:30:33.400
Right.
We'll work on that part.

509
00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:35.204
How long were you
in the military?

510
00:30:36.537 --> 00:30:38.636
Uh. almost 30 years.

511
00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:40.440
Hm.

512
00:30:40.475 --> 00:30:42.277
Set up operations
in some of the biggest.

513
00:30:42.312 --> 00:30:45.445
baddest clusterfucks
on the planet.

514
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.118
And your wife?

515
00:30:48.153 --> 00:30:50.252
Abby was a Marine.

516
00:30:50.287 --> 00:30:53.354
She's the badass
in the family.

517
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:54.487
Yeah.

518
00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:10.074
Mom. you okay?

519
00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:12.307
Yeah.

520
00:31:12.342 --> 00:31:14.408
Yeah. I'm fine. I...

521
00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:17.807
I was just thinking
about this dream I had

522
00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.578
when I was a little girl.

523
00:31:19.613 --> 00:31:21.580
I was...

524
00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:27.157
Never mind.
We should go help your dad.

525
00:31:27.192 --> 00:31:29.060
Lots to do.

526
00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:37.629
Can't go. not now.

527
00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:39.631
Damn near had
a riot at the diner.

528
00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:41.633
But this is exactly
why you said you had to go.

529
00:31:41.668 --> 00:31:44.372
Things are coming apart.
It's already starting to happen.

530
00:31:44.407 --> 00:31:46.209
We lost over a dozen people
last night.

531
00:31:46.244 --> 00:31:49.311
And we'll lose more if...
if they start to panic.

532
00:31:49.346 --> 00:31:51.148
-At least if you--
-Kenny. enough.

533
00:31:51.183 --> 00:31:53.150
I'll stay until
things settle down.

534
00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:55.383
And what if they don't?

535
00:31:55.418 --> 00:31:57.319
What if they don't?

536
00:31:57.354 --> 00:31:58.518
Am I interrupting?

537
00:31:58.553 --> 00:31:59.618
No. come on in.

538
00:31:59.653 --> 00:32:00.784
Sheriff. please--

539
00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:04.293
Kenny. we're done. Okay?

540
00:32:04.328 --> 00:32:07.230
We're not done.

541
00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:11.597
I said. we're not done.

542
00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:14.666
You told me you had to go.

543
00:32:14.701 --> 00:32:16.668
You told me
that I had to step up

544
00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:19.473
and be strong
while you were gone.

545
00:32:19.508 --> 00:32:21.310
You told me we were
running out of time.

546
00:32:21.345 --> 00:32:23.873
and what part
of that's changed? Huh?

547
00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:26.249
We've all been sitting
around the last few months.

548
00:32:26.284 --> 00:32:28.218
acting like those
talismans were a solution.

549
00:32:28.253 --> 00:32:30.913
Like they made us safe?

550
00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:34.389
Well. guess what.
We were never safe.

551
00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:36.787
Those talismans were a Band-Aid.

552
00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:39.526
a-- a temporary reprieve.

553
00:32:40.562 --> 00:32:42.628
Things were never okay here.

554
00:32:42.663 --> 00:32:46.632
and things are never
going to be okay here.

555
00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:54.508
We need to find a way home

556
00:32:54.543 --> 00:32:57.313
or else every
single person here

557
00:32:57.348 --> 00:32:59.579
is gonna end up
exactly like Father Khatri.

558
00:33:02.353 --> 00:33:05.255
There are answers out there.

559
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.258
and you're going to find them.

560
00:33:08.293 --> 00:33:09.721
And in the meantime.

561
00:33:09.756 --> 00:33:12.493
you need to get over
what happened last night.

562
00:33:12.528 --> 00:33:13.791
You need to get
your shit together

563
00:33:13.826 --> 00:33:15.859
and be the scary hard-ass
that you've always been

564
00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:18.796
because that's who people
need you to be right now.

565
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:22.569
And if we're not gonna fight
like hell to go home.

566
00:33:22.604 --> 00:33:25.440
then we might as well swallow
a fucking bullet right now.

567
00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:29.345
Is that what you want?

568
00:33:42.624 --> 00:33:45.559
I didn't know the little
bastard had that in him.

569
00:33:47.464 --> 00:33:49.266
Now. how about you explain

570
00:33:49.301 --> 00:33:51.565
what the fuck
he was talking about?

571
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.369
Where exactly are you going?

572
00:33:53.404 --> 00:33:57.208
Let's take a walk.
I'll explain on the way.

573
00:33:58.739 --> 00:33:59.969
Come on. man!
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

574
00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:03.709
Come on!
Help me out a little bit here.

575
00:34:03.744 --> 00:34:04.743
Hey!

576
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:07.548
Look what I found!

577
00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:09.847
Okay. what? Where--
where did you--?

578
00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:13.015
I-- He was about half
a mile out. eating some grass.

579
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.588
There are chickens
out there too.

580
00:34:14.623 --> 00:34:16.425
Tomorrow.
I'm gonna set up some traps.

581
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.723
There's chickens in the forest?

582
00:34:17.758 --> 00:34:18.590
Yep.

583
00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:20.594
Hey. you know what?
Grab some people.

584
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:23.267
We need to start rebuilding
that. uh. pen outside the barn.

585
00:34:23.302 --> 00:34:24.664
Okay? Hey! Hey!

586
00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:25.431
Hey.

587
00:34:25.467 --> 00:34:27.304
-I found a goat.
-He got a goat.

588
00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:28.734
Yeah. that's great.

589
00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:30.868
Hey. uh. look.
I need to talk to you.

590
00:34:30.903 --> 00:34:32.870
All right. Hey. could you
take him off my hands?

591
00:34:32.905 --> 00:34:34.377
No.

592
00:34:34.412 --> 00:34:35.609
Yeah. no. you got it.
Yeah. yeah.

593
00:34:35.644 --> 00:34:37.347
He's not exactly what
I'd call cooperative.

594
00:34:37.382 --> 00:34:38.348
but just hold the rope.

595
00:34:38.383 --> 00:34:39.349
-Yeah.
-You got it.

596
00:34:39.384 --> 00:34:40.746
-I. uh...
-You believe that?

597
00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:42.880
I knew I was gonna find
something out in those woods.

598
00:34:42.915 --> 00:34:45.454
I ain't think it was gonna be
livestock. but I'll take it.

599
00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:46.587
Who knows what else might be--

600
00:34:46.622 --> 00:34:48.358
You need to stop
going out there.

601
00:34:48.393 --> 00:34:49.590
What?

602
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:51.889
It's Mom.
She's not doing well. Okay?

603
00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:53.891
I mean. you've been going out
there for weeks now.

604
00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:55.893
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

605
00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:58.764
I think this place is. like.
starting to get to her.

606
00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:00.898
Okay.

607
00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:03.967
Look. I know you're scared. man.

608
00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:08.807
I'm fricking terrified.
But do me a favor. Look around.

609
00:35:08.842 --> 00:35:11.942
The things we are doing
are working.

610
00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:14.549
There are things out
in those woods that can help us.

611
00:35:14.584 --> 00:35:18.388
things that might even--
All I know. all I know is that

612
00:35:18.423 --> 00:35:22.359
the second we stop looking for
answers. that's when we lose.

613
00:35:22.394 --> 00:35:23.921
Okay. so. then why don't
we just get someone else

614
00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:26.528
to go and look for a while?
Dad. we need you here.

615
00:35:26.563 --> 00:35:28.497
Mom needs you here!

616
00:35:28.532 --> 00:35:32.600
Okay. look. she-- she's not...

617
00:35:32.635 --> 00:35:34.800
You know. sometimes.
I-I see her just standing.

618
00:35:34.835 --> 00:35:37.473
staring off in the middle
of the road. like she's--

619
00:35:37.508 --> 00:35:41.070
Your mom... Your mom is
as tough as they come.

620
00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:43.105
Iron Abby. remember?

621
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.351
Now. I know this is hard.
but this is what we have to do.

622
00:35:47.386 --> 00:35:48.715
at least for now.

623
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.784
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying to you!

624
00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:54.622
Look. look. okay. okay.
Look. look. Look. look.

625
00:35:54.657 --> 00:35:57.526
We got about four hours
of daylight left. right?

626
00:35:57.561 --> 00:36:00.463
Help your mom get everybody
secured. tucked away.

627
00:36:00.498 --> 00:36:03.125
And when I get home
tonight. we will talk.

628
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.896
I promise.

629
00:36:06.504 --> 00:36:08.735
Dad. please...

630
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.001
just stay.

631
00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:13.971
We will talk tonight.

632
00:36:14.006 --> 00:36:15.478
Okay?

633
00:36:17.482 --> 00:36:19.482
Go help your mom.

634
00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:45.134
What are you doin' out here?

635
00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:51.448
Well. you belong to someone.

636
00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:54.715
Someone out here maybe?

637
00:36:58.919 --> 00:37:01.524
You live out here
with someone. buddy?

638
00:37:01.559 --> 00:37:03.427
-It's okay.

639
00:37:03.462 --> 00:37:05.792
It's okay.

640
00:37:06.993 --> 00:37:09.499
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

641
00:37:09.534 --> 00:37:11.699
I just wanna get
a closer look.

642
00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:17.672
Hey! Hey! Hey!

643
00:37:24.945 --> 00:37:26.615
Hey!

644
00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:33.149
What the...

645
00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:39.925
No.

646
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.795
No. no.

647
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.450
Fuck!

648
00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:21.934
What?

649
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.025
What the...

650
00:40:13.212 --> 00:40:15.619
Luck. not skill.

651
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.152
Sheriff Stevens.

652
00:40:21.187 --> 00:40:24.188
Heard you had a rough go of it
last night.

653
00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:29.765
Sorry about Father Khatri.

654
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.031
Oh. I appreciate that.

655
00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:33.637
I. uh...

656
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.137
Not sure if you heard.
but I'm setting off today.

657
00:40:39.172 --> 00:40:41.172
Gonna find us a way
outta this place.

658
00:40:41.207 --> 00:40:43.977
So. in other words. you're about
to go off into the woods

659
00:40:44.012 --> 00:40:46.716
with no idea
what you're looking for.

660
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:49.213
Because that worked
so well last time.

661
00:40:49.248 --> 00:40:50.280
Hey.

662
00:40:50.315 --> 00:40:51.853
Right?

663
00:40:51.888 --> 00:40:54.251
Fatima. would you
give us a second?

664
00:40:54.286 --> 00:40:56.253
Yeah. of course.

665
00:40:56.288 --> 00:40:57.694
Thank you.

666
00:41:05.704 --> 00:41:08.397
You wanna be angry with me.

667
00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:11.037
you wanna hate me. that's fine.

668
00:41:11.939 --> 00:41:14.843
But I'm gonna say
a couple things and. uh.

669
00:41:14.878 --> 00:41:19.243
and you're gonna listen.
whether you want to or not.

670
00:41:21.214 --> 00:41:23.412
Go ahead.

671
00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.051
If something happens
to me out there.

672
00:41:25.086 --> 00:41:29.022
if I don't... make it back.

673
00:41:29.057 --> 00:41:32.861
I never want you to regret
what you didn't say.

674
00:41:34.931 --> 00:41:37.800
I never want you to feel...

675
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:43.674
I won't be here to
tell you that it's okay.

676
00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:49.405
So. I'm telling you now.

677
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.310
Man. it's okay.

678
00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:57.754
And that you are my son.

679
00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:59.217
Mine.

680
00:42:00.825 --> 00:42:03.320
I love you.

681
00:42:03.355 --> 00:42:07.192
and I am proud of the man
that you have become.

682
00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:13.099
And not a single day goes by
when that hasn't been true.

683
00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.774
Okay?

684
00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.780
Yeah.

685
00:42:23.815 --> 00:42:26.442
Yeah. it's okay.

686
00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:28.180
Okay.

687
00:42:34.254 --> 00:42:35.858
Okay.

688
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:48.871
How'd that go?

689
00:42:48.906 --> 00:42:51.401
About as well
as could be expected.

690
00:42:51.436 --> 00:42:54.041
He'll come 'round.

691
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.275
You really going?

692
00:42:59.411 --> 00:43:01.081
Looks like.

693
00:43:03.283 --> 00:43:07.087
You and me. we've had our
differences. but I just. uh...

694
00:43:08.893 --> 00:43:11.091
Thank you...

695
00:43:11.126 --> 00:43:13.896
for looking after him.

696
00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:15.458
You've done
something I couldn't.

697
00:43:15.493 --> 00:43:17.295
You did enough. Boyd.

698
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.838
You did more than anyone
should ever have to.

699
00:43:21.873 --> 00:43:24.236
So. you come back. okay?

700
00:43:24.271 --> 00:43:26.909
Who the hell else
am I gonna argue with?

701
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.879
Sure you'll find someone.

702
00:43:29.914 --> 00:43:31.045
-Fuck off.

703
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.882
-What?
-Come on.

704
00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:36.347
Now. get the fuck outta here

705
00:43:36.382 --> 00:43:39.823
before people start
thinking we're friends.

706
00:43:39.858 --> 00:43:41.055
Yes. ma'am.

707
00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:53.562
I'm gonna say something to you
that might make you hate me.

708
00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:56.070
and if it does. that's okay.

709
00:43:58.272 --> 00:44:01.438
What happened
wasn't your Dad's fault.

710
00:44:01.473 --> 00:44:04.540
and it wasn't yours.
It was this place.

711
00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:09.182
I wasn't here. I may not have
seen it. but I know your Dad.

712
00:44:09.217 --> 00:44:11.448
I know that if
there was anything.

713
00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:14.385
anything else he could've done.
he would've done it.

714
00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:20.226
What happened was so awful...

715
00:44:20.261 --> 00:44:24.395
it's almost inconceivable.
and it fills you with rage.

716
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.232
rage that you needed
to put somewhere.

717
00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:29.070
And this whole time.
your dad let you put it on him

718
00:44:29.105 --> 00:44:32.337
because that's what parents do.

719
00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:35.241
But did you. for a second.
stop to consider

720
00:44:35.276 --> 00:44:38.145
what that day was like for him.

721
00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.952
what he's carried every
second of every day since?

722
00:44:49.488 --> 00:44:52.258
If you don't get up
and go after him right now.

723
00:44:52.293 --> 00:44:55.899
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

724
00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:30.494
What's--

725
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:33.332
Babe?

726
00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:37.336
Ab?

727
00:45:40.506 --> 00:45:42.506
What's happening. Abs?

728
00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:45.113
What's going on. Abs?

729
00:45:49.383 --> 00:45:51.548
Abs?

730
00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:53.121
Abby?

731
00:45:53.156 --> 00:45:55.057
Oh. God. Oh. God.

732
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.291
Ab--

733
00:45:58.326 --> 00:46:01.558
Please.
Please. why are you doing this?

734
00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:03.197
It's okay.

735
00:46:03.232 --> 00:46:06.464
It's not real.
It's a nightmare.

736
00:46:06.499 --> 00:46:10.105
The only way for us to go home
is to wake everyone up.

737
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.570
It's okay.
You can't die in dreams.

738
00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.176
Everything's gonna be okay.

739
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:17.640
Abby.
Abby. stop! Stop!

740
00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:19.312
S-s-stop.

741
00:46:19.347 --> 00:46:22.183
No. No.

742
00:46:22.218 --> 00:46:25.087
Hey. Hey.
I found something.

743
00:46:25.122 --> 00:46:26.451
s-something I think
is gonna help us.

744
00:46:26.486 --> 00:46:28.618
You didn't come back
before it got dark.

745
00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:30.719
There's no way you could
have survived out there.

746
00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:33.392
not if it was real.

747
00:46:33.427 --> 00:46:34.998
Yeah.

748
00:46:35.033 --> 00:46:39.068
It's time to wake up.
It's time to wake everybody up.

749
00:46:39.103 --> 00:46:42.071
Baby. please.

750
00:46:42.106 --> 00:46:43.468
Baby...

751
00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:50.376
Right! If I had a pony?

752
00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:52.147
-Mom! Mom!

753
00:46:52.182 --> 00:46:53.544
-Mom!

754
00:46:53.579 --> 00:46:55.414
No. no!

755
00:47:48.601 --> 00:47:51.437
Dad?

756
00:47:52.572 --> 00:47:56.475
Ellis. what are
you doing out here?

757
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.642
Um...

758
00:47:58.677 --> 00:48:01.579
I've been following you
since you left town.

759
00:48:01.614 --> 00:48:04.417
I've been. um...

760
00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:06.848
I've been trying to find the
courage to say something to you.

761
00:48:10.425 --> 00:48:13.129
Look. last night. when. uh.

762
00:48:13.164 --> 00:48:14.790
those things got inside
of Colony House.

763
00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:18.629
Fatima and I.
we would've died.

764
00:48:19.398 --> 00:48:22.336
I mean. there was no way
that we could've survived that.

765
00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:29.277
But the one thing that saved us.

766
00:48:29.312 --> 00:48:31.675
that saved her...

767
00:48:33.316 --> 00:48:35.613
was the talisman on the door.

768
00:48:42.325 --> 00:48:46.459
I've just been so angry
for a really long time...

769
00:48:49.233 --> 00:48:51.497
...and I. uh...

770
00:48:54.733 --> 00:48:56.403
I didn't know how to...

771
00:48:59.507 --> 00:49:02.805
But. you know. if you
didn't do what you did.

772
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.248
if you didn't bring
those talismans back...

773
00:49:13.389 --> 00:49:15.257
It wasn't your fault. Dad.

774
00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:21.329
What Mom did.
it wasn't...

775
00:49:21.364 --> 00:49:23.595
It wasn't your fault.

776
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:30.371
Look. I'm sorry.
Yeah. I'm so sorry. Dad.

777
00:49:30.406 --> 00:49:31.405
I'm so sorry.

778
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.474
No. no. no. hey.
Hey. no.

779
00:49:35.543 --> 00:49:38.313
It's okay. It's all right.

780
00:49:38.348 --> 00:49:40.381
I just-- I just didn't
want you to leave

781
00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:41.910
without saying goodbye.

782
00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.483
This is not goodbye.

783
00:49:43.518 --> 00:49:46.387
Okay? You hear me? Huh?

784
00:49:46.422 --> 00:49:48.785
This is not goodbye.

785
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.786
Okay.

786
00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:51.359
All right.

787
00:49:56.564 --> 00:49:57.761
Hey.

788
00:49:59.732 --> 00:50:00.798
What is she doing here?

789
00:50:00.833 --> 00:50:03.734
Look. I need
to take her with me. Okay?

790
00:50:03.769 --> 00:50:05.505
Wait. no. you know
what she tried to do!

791
00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.639
No. no. no! Hey. look. look.
I need to take her with me

792
00:50:07.674 --> 00:50:10.708
'cause she might be helpful
for us to find out

793
00:50:10.743 --> 00:50:12.578
what we're looking
for out there. okay?

794
00:50:12.613 --> 00:50:14.877
I will explain everything
to you when I get back.

795
00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:16.417
We'll have a long conversation.

796
00:50:16.452 --> 00:50:18.485
hopefully on our way
outta this place.

797
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.720
But for now. right now. I just
need you to trust me. okay?

798
00:50:22.755 --> 00:50:25.294
Okay. no one can
know she's with me.

799
00:50:25.329 --> 00:50:26.592
Can you do that for me?

800
00:50:26.627 --> 00:50:29.595
Can you trust me?

801
00:50:33.832 --> 00:50:35.733
Just come back.

802
00:50:35.768 --> 00:50:38.241
Yes. sir.

803
00:50:38.276 --> 00:50:40.606
All right.

804
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:43.279
Go on. Go.

805
00:50:43.314 --> 00:50:44.478
I love you.

806
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.317
I love you. too.

807
00:50:48.352 --> 00:50:50.418
Okay.

808
00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:55.357
Yeah.

809
00:51:03.565 --> 00:51:06.269
Look. we're in a tight spot.

810
00:51:06.304 --> 00:51:08.502
No one's gonna
pretend otherwise.

811
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:12.000
But Sheriff Boyd
is risking everything for us

812
00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.837
out there in the forest.

813
00:51:13.872 --> 00:51:16.279
The least we can do is...

814
00:51:16.314 --> 00:51:18.644
keep ourselves
together while he does.

815
00:51:18.679 --> 00:51:21.383
So that means that we're gonna
do things a little differently

816
00:51:21.418 --> 00:51:22.714
going forwards.

817
00:51:22.749 --> 00:51:26.322
No more Colony House.
no more town.

818
00:51:26.357 --> 00:51:29.017
We're a community. so...

819
00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:32.020
we do this together.

820
00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:34.396
All you Colony House folk.

821
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:36.893
I don't want any of you
being shitty houseguests.

822
00:51:36.928 --> 00:51:40.369
Now. we're gonna get
the house put back together.

823
00:51:40.404 --> 00:51:42.030
but first of all.

824
00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:44.703
Jim here has an idea about
a way we might be able to get

825
00:51:44.738 --> 00:51:46.738
a signal to folks
back in the world.

826
00:51:46.773 --> 00:51:49.807
So we can either
put our energy towards

827
00:51:49.842 --> 00:51:51.842
boarding up a bunch
of broken windows.

828
00:51:51.877 --> 00:51:54.911
or we can help build
something that gets us all

829
00:51:54.946 --> 00:51:57.617
out of this shithole.

830
00:51:57.652 --> 00:51:58.519
Jim?

831
00:52:02.657 --> 00:52:05.856
Well. we're gonna need supplies.

832
00:52:05.891 --> 00:52:08.562
anything we can get
our hands on.

833
00:52:08.597 --> 00:52:11.532
We're gonna need batteries.
anything with a charge.

834
00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:14.931
But most of all.
we're gonna need people.

835
00:52:14.966 --> 00:52:17.736
The sooner we get this built.

836
00:52:17.771 --> 00:52:19.606
the sooner we can all go home.

837
00:52:26.813 --> 00:52:29.517
Hey. You find him?

838
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.850
-Yeah.

839
00:52:32.885 --> 00:52:34.819
-You okay?

840
00:52:34.854 --> 00:52:38.625
-No.

841
00:52:55.644 --> 00:52:56.973
Can't take any chances.

842
00:53:12.089 --> 00:53:13.990
Let's go.
