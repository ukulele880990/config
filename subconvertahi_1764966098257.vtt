- The days of me forgetting are over.

You know. when you go on like this.
what you sound like ?

9
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.421
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

10
00:00:51.498 --> 00:00:54.956
- Quack. quack. quack.
- Take heart. 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:58.527
Since I'm never gonna
do it again. you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

12

- After tonight ?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

I mean. the way it is now.

16
00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:16.652
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

17
00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:18.782
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

18
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.885
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

19
00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:26.194
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck ? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

20
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.724
Heard about this one bloke. he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

21
00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:32.772
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says.

22
00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:36.400
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money. we're gonna kill her."

23
00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:39.274
- Did it work ?
- Fuckin' right it worked.

- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl ?

26
00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:53.653
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

27
00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:56.719
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

28
00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:59.766
- You want to rob banks ?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

easier than what we've been doing.

-No more liquor stores ?
-What've we been talkin' about ?
Yeah. no more liquor stores.

31
00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:09.542
Besides. it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

what you're talkin' about.

34
00:02:14.047 --> 00:02:15.981
They make it too personal.

35
00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.281
- We keep on. one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

36
00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:24.653
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

37
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:26.658
And if it's not the gooks.

38
00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:29.354

the store for 15 fucking generations.

Not as expectin' anyway.

- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge.

which. if you do what I say.
when I say it. should be plenty.

Do me a favor. will ya ? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

Oh. uh. um.
how do you take it ?

1771
02:03:32.192 --> 02:03:34.752
Lotsa cream. lotsa sugar.

1772
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:40.266
About the car. is there anything
I need to know ? Does it stall ?

1773
02:03:40.334 --> 02:03:43.770
Does it smoke ? Does it make
a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?

1774
02:03:43.837 --> 02:03:47.273
- Aside from how it looks.
the car's cool.
- Positive ?

1775
02:03:47.341 --> 02:03:50.777
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1776
02:03:50.844 --> 02:03:54.905
- As far as I know.
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

- Thank you. Jimmie.

Mmm.

02:04:13.433 --> 02:04:15.560
Okay. first thing.
You two.

1782
02:04:15.636 --> 02:04:18.571
Take the body.
stick it in the trunk.

1783
02:04:18.639 --> 02:04:21.369
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1784
02:04:21.441 --> 02:04:25.377
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1785
02:04:25.445 --> 02:04:28.881
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1786
02:04:28.949 --> 02:04:32.976
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast. fast. fast.

1787
02:04:33.053 --> 02:04:36.989
Go in the back seat. scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1788
02:04:37.057 --> 02:04:39.992
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1789
02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:42.995
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1790
02:04:43.063 --> 02:04:47.432
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1791
02:04:47.501 --> 02:04:51.597
The pools of blood that have collected.
you gotta soak that shit up.

1792

We need to raid
your linen closet.

1793
02:04:54.174 --> 02:04:57.109
I need blankets.
I need comforters. quilts. bedspreads.

1794
02:04:57.177 --> 02:05:00.806
The thicker the better.
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1795
02:05:00.881 --> 02:05:06.183
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1796
02:05:06.253 --> 02:05:08.187
with quilts and blankets.

1797
02:05:08.255 --> 02:05:12.191

his big snout in the car.
the subterfuge won't last.

1798
02:05:12.259 --> 02:05:15.126

will appear to be normal.

Jimmie. lead the way.
Boys. get to work.

1800

not appreciated. lotsa luck. gentlemen.

mean disrespect. okay ? I respect you.

barkin' orders at me.

it's because time is a factor.

and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

that meant your ass.
