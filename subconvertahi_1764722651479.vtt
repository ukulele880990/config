﻿1
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.896
Today is gonna be a big day of training.

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.776
- Years of notes in here.
- What's that?

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.196
It's nothing. But if a man
comes in with a white gardenia.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.326
you don't talk to him. Only me. okay?

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.696
You don't wanna get involved. Got it?

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.696
Guys. the police report just came in.

7
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.956
Accidental death?

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.286
- You're the cuckoo chick!
- Cuckoo what?

9
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.746
Lester likened all the tenants to birds.

10
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.666
Why does the shrimp you're
holding have a fingernail?

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.546
It looks like there's some
sort of green fungus on the nail.

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.296
You've heard about my
family's ties to criminal activity.

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.636
Can you explain what
you meant when you said

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.476
that your missing husband has
everything to do with our building?

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.356
We own clean-ups. the
dry cleaner in the arconia.

16
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.016
How many guests are we expecting?

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.236
Just althea. Tim. and a
few friends from bay port.

18
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.026
Nicky used to carry these decks
around everywhere he went.

19
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.736
There's a map on the
back of one of Nicky's cards.

20
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.930
Hello?

21
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.296
George Bernard Shaw once said.

22
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.506
"in gambling. the many must lose

23
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.006
in order that the few may win."

24
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.216
He also said some pro-Stalin things.

25
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.426
and he was kind of anti-cow.
which isn't relevant here.

26
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.056
- Mabel. can we cut that?
- No.

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.186
Okay. great.

28
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.896
At the onset of the 1910s.
the rise of the automobile

29
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.986
rendered the horse stables
under the arconia obsolete.

30
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.946
It wasn't long before some of
New York's most infamous mobsters

31
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.866
found a new. more
lucrative use for the space.

32
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.116
By the 1920s. the mob
had secret gaming rooms

33
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.326
all over the city.

34
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.076
and none played host
to more power players

35
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.586
than the velvet room.

36
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.786
For over a century.

37
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.126
some of the most consequential
decisions in the city were made here.

38
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.256
Rumor has it.

39
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.386
this is where the empire state
building contract was awarded.

40
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.216
where it was decided that bars
could stay open until 4:00 A.M..

41
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.346
and where. at the last second.

42
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.936
it was changed from
"Zachary Taylor island."

43
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.936
to "Roosevelt island."

44
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.026
Even as the fashion. decor. and
clientele changed over the years.

45
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.696
the mob.

46
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.986
Everyone from lucky Luciano
to John gotti wielded power

47
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.366
over the five boroughs from this location.

48
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.826
known to an elite few.

49
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.100
And that continues to this day.

50
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.166
I always assumed the
velvet room was a myth.

51
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.706
but it was right here all along.

52
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.666
How did I miss it?

53
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.336
Well. to be fair. it was
down a secret staircase

54
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.716
that only opened with
a magic deck of cards.

55
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.426
I wouldn't beat yourself up too much.

56
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.476
You know. this does make for a
good opening twist of our podcast.

57
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.686
Should I be videoing? A lot of podcasts

58
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.436
are doing video now.

59
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.790
Do you hear that?

60
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.026
- Is that...?
- My god. my god!

61
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.656
- Oliver. is that you?
- Mabel?

62
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.116
Are you okay? What's going on?

63
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.326
I'm in the dry cleaners. I
found Nicky caccimelio.

64
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.536
Great! Can you keep him there?

65
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.206
Shouldn't be too hard.

66
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.690
He's dead!

67
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.796
Does he have all his fingers?

68
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.200
His fingers?

69
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.136
- Geez.
- Okay. okay. just stay calm.

70
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.476
and meet us at Charles's apartment!

71
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.186
And Oliver. whatever you
do. don't touch the body!

72
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.250
The last thing you want is your
DNA all over a dead mobster's body.

73
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.406
- Hey. watch where you're going. pal!
- Sorry.

74
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.956
- No!
- Whoa!

75
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.956
Wha... what are you doing?!

76
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.256
I paid extra for starch. I'll have you know!

77
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.074
Do you want subtitles for any video?
-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-

78
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.920
Uma. so fun to see you.

79
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.026
Smells like somebody died in here.

80
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.076
You... you truly are the building cut-up.

81
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.126
Have... have you ever tried open mic?

82
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.690
Why are you sweating?

83
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.820
Excuse me?

84
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.216
Why are you sweating?

85
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.136
I wasn't... I wasn't
aware that I'm sweating.

86
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.516
Menopause is tricky. even for us fellas.

87
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.026
I gotta move out of this building.

88
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.300
- Oliver?
- What's with the dry cleaning?

89
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.576
My god. Oliver!

90
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.036
What the hell did you do?!

91
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.506
My god. Oliver!

92
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.216
What part of "don't touch a dead
body" did you not understand?

93
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.466
Well. I sneezed on him.

94
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.216
I'm allergic to gardenias and martinizing.

95
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.006
Look. I-I-I get that this looks...

96
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.346
- like you've lost your mind.
- Like you've committed a felony.

97
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.596
I was gonna go "a bit kooky."
but yes. those also work.

98
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.766
Oliver. what did you do?

99
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.146
It's really quite simple. After sneezing.

100
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.986
I had to clean my essence off him.

101
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.276
and then I blacked out.
and the next thing I know.

102
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.906
I am pushing a corpse down 86th street.

103
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.446
And no one noticed you with a dead
body. pushing it in a laundry cart?

104
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.746
Please. this is Manhattan.
it didn't even crack

105
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.956
the top three weirdest
things happening on the block.

106
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.076
But why'd you bring
him to my apartment?

107
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.166
Well. I... obviously. I didn't want
a dead body in my apartment.

108
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.256
You only think of yourself.
This is so typical you.

109
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.740
I have never brought a
dead body to your home.

110
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.796
What is this?!

111
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.966
Well. you've implied I've
done it before. which I haven't!

112
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.096
Go fuck yourself!

113
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.880
Believe me. I've tried that. it didn't work.

114
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.186
You tried it?

115
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.976
- Guys!
- You've tried... what?

116
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.816
Can we focus on what to do with
this expired human in front of us?

117
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.276
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
- He is so dead.

118
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.260
I mean. this is it. This is
what we're all gonna look like.

119
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.946
No. no. No. no. not me.
I have a signed napkin

120
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.996
from the guy who did
makeup on planet of the apes.

121
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.576
and Rick told me no
matter how mangled it is.

122
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.536
he's gonna make my
corpse look like. tops. 35.

123
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.376
I feel faint. I'm woozy.

124
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.126
Do I look woozy? I feel woozy.

125
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.676
Okay. calm down. woozy.

126
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.386
The dry cleaners doesn't open until 7:00.

127
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.716
Whoever put Nicky there
is expecting for the body

128
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.476
- to be found tomorrow when they open.
- Right. right. right. right.

129
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.016
So. we need to get Oliver's
DNA off and put the body back

130
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.936
before they realize we took it. Okay?

131
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.066
- Good plan. Yes.
- I hate this.

132
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.180
Now... does anybody know how
to clean DNA off a dead body?

133
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.906
Okay. I think I'm off him.

134
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.906
I'm glad I got these
wet-naps from the wings place.

135
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.866
- You eat wings?
- No. of course not.

136
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.746
But you can't get the
wet-naps anywhere else.

137
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.836
Well. at least now we
know he has all of his fingers.

138
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.256
Wait.

139
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.126
There's something green under his nails.

140
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.046
just like our shrimp finger.

141
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.686
That's f1 grade Lachlan felt.

142
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.210
made from the wool of the
now-extinct Scottish dunface sheep.

143
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.816
That's the same felt they have
in the velvet room downstairs.

144
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.936
- What are you talking...
- well. I used to deal cards

145
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.606
on poker night. and you'd be surprised

146
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.816
how different felts can
affect the card slide.

147
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.616
You wanna get a good
toss and have the card...

148
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.656
my god. he managed
to make gambling boring.

149
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.036
Can we get back to Nicky?

150
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.786
Do we have to call the body by its name?

151
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.036
I mean. you're not even
supposed to name lobsters.

152
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.416
Well. his name is the only
thing we know about him.

153
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.796
It's kind of weird.

154
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.570
First time we didn't know a victim.

155
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.426
It's easy to guess the kind
of guy he was. I suppose.

156
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.796
- I can't stand to look at him.
- What's the matter?

157
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.370
Thinkin' about what your corpse
is gonna look like in this apartment?

158
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.726
I'm guessin' you're gonna
die alone. in the bedroom.

159
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.976
Or on the toilet.

160
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.436
Also a popular pick.

161
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.486
Why does this always happen to me?

162
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.856
Or maybe you'll make
things really interesting

163
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.286
and die alone in a
laundry cart? Twinsies!

164
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.536
Except I didn't die alone.

165
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.536
I got a hot wife.

166
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.996
But I don't gotta tell you about her. do I?

167
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.350
You little perv.

168
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.006
Okay. and this ends this
episode of "CSI: My apartment."

169
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.830
Let's take the body back.

170
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.040
Really?

171
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.226
Hear me out.

172
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.896
We found the envelope.

173
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.476
so we know that Lester
was in the gaming room.

174
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.896
If you're right about the
felt. Nicky was in there. too.

175
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.936
And if there's any chance
these deaths are linked.

176
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.276
don't you think we owe
it to Lester to find out?

177
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.486
Linked? They died a week apart.

178
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.156
He is wearing the same clothes
from the day of my wedding.

179
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.786
He could have been dead since then.

180
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.656
Look at his gardenia. It's not wilted.

181
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.166
He died recently.

182
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.416
I agree. something's not adding up.

183
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.586
Look. we handed
Lester's body to the cops.

184
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.086
and they called it "an accident."

185
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.926
Are we really gonna do
the same thing with Nicky?

186
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.426
I know it's kind of gross.
but this is an opportunity

187
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.846
for us to look for clues
we'd otherwise never get.

188
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.726
Plus. it'd be good for the podcast.

189
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.066
I mean. I don't think
anybody's doing this.

190
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.776
I do love a good "first."

191
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.146
Well. I guess it wouldn't
hurt to take a little peek.

192
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.646
We're doing an autopsy?

193
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.776
I said a peek. a little peek!

194
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.930
Okay. yes. yes.

195
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.166
Autopsy step one. cause of death.

196
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.496
Well. I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and say meat cleaver to the chest.

197
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.876
"Meat cleaver."

198
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.716
Nice.

199
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.966
You know. I always wanted to
get gunned down in a toll booth.

200
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.506
Sonny corleone style.

201
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.216
But that dream went out
the window with e-zpass.

202
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.516
Still. this isn't bad. Better
than whatever boring way

203
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.960
you're gonna go out. right. savage?

204
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.396
Time of death.

205
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.300
"Corpse is cristy."

206
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.446
That podcast about cristy tejas.

207
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.026
the co-ed who died in
corpus christi. Texas.

208
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.736
They got so lucky.

209
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.600
The whole case revolved
around the time of her death.

210
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.900
Someone's gonna have to
check to see if he has rigor mortis.

211
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.780
Fine. I'll do it.

212
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.006
Ha! No rigor mortis.

213
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.636
So. he died in the last few hours.

214
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.926
Or the rigor mortis has already
passed and he's limbered up again.

215
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.306
Yeah. it looks like blood
has pooled by his ankles.

216
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.476
I don't think that's supposed
to happen right away.

217
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.976
Probably a little sauce
from that meatball sandwich

218
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.856
I was eating earlier. Bada-bing!

219
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.106
Seriously. this is how
you imagine I speak?

220
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.366
I mean. I know I'm a
member of the family.

221
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.616
but I'm personally offended.

222
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.850
I went to Cornell. you know.

223
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.916
Okay. fine. I didn't go to
Cornell. but you didn't know that.

224
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.310
Wait.

225
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.626
And there's this white
substance on his sleeve.

226
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.296
- Maybe cocaine?
- Ooh. let me sniff.

227
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.636
I directed theater in the
'80s. I could probably tell you

228
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.546
the exact street in
Colombia it came from.

229
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.306
I think it looks like paint.

230
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.330
Yeah.

231
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.396
Gee. I miss cocaine.

232
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.566
I'm sure it misses you too. pal.

233
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.946
No sign of maggots or blowfly eggs.

234
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.446
And I was just getting hungry.

235
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.906
Don't "" me.

236
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.366
What. your corpse is
too good for maggots.

237
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.360
or whatever those other
things this girl said are?

238
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.426
Rope marks. Ooh. this
could be a sexy crime.

239
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.426
We probably should check his nipples.

240
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.380
- What's this?
- No. not the sur la table tongs!

241
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.396
Please don't say maggots.
Please don't say maggots.

242
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.856
No. it kinda looks like a burn.

243
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.666
While rigor indicates
Nicky's been dead for days.

244
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.376
the decomp level
suggests he died recently.

245
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.166
Wow. that was so cool.

246
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.206
I know. I'm giving. like.
Meredith Grey vibes.

247
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.280
You seem awfully
cheery about this autopsy.

248
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.096
I know this is weird to
say over a dead body.

249
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.806
but I feel like I'm in a really
good place in life right now.

250
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.886
You are.

251
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.686
You're doing your first autopsy.

252
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.396
- Your new apartment is really shaping up.
- I know.

253
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.476
It feels like I've earned
my spot in the building.

254
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.486
And I feel... wait. sorry. we
still don't have time of death.

255
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.406
Ha! What we need is leftovers.

256
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.066
Charles. what do you
have in your fridge?

257
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.696
I think I have some
Chinese in the freezer.

258
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.156
- but it's a couple of months...
- perfect!

259
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.746
All my greatest creative
breakthroughs have happened

260
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.810
over reheated Chinese food.

261
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.386
What if this is the last thing
Lester saw before he died?

262
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.346
- Me. yelling at him about shrimp.
- Oliver.

263
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.396
After all he did for me. Am I a narcissist?

264
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.936
No! I mean. just clinically.

265
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.356
What?

266
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.316
Mabel. what's the first
word that comes to mind

267
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.196
- when you think of me?
- Narcissist.

268
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.406
What the hell?

269
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.776
How am I just learning this at 55?

270
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.076
Look. you can't change the
last things you said to Lester.

271
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.996
and you can't change who you are.

272
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.126
We are complex characters.
We are flawed heroes.

273
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:08.216
Flawed dudes. Flawed... lucky fuckers.

274
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.466
Sorry. I didn't mean to get philosophical.

275
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.256
Yeah. where is this coming from?

276
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.926
It happens every time I have
a dead body in my kitchen.

277
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.580
Hey. buddy.

278
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.896
Enjoying Oliver's famous
microwaved dumplings?

279
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.816
He managed to make it
boiling hot on the outside.

280
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.090
- yet freezer burned on the inside.
- Please.

281
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.366
Oliver. you're a genius.

282
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.446
Wow. where was that
word two minutes ago?

283
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.696
What if the burn behind Nicky's ear

284
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.826
isn't a regular burn. it's freezer burn?

285
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.616
It would explain why the
body hasn't decomposed.

286
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.336
He could have been killed days
ago. frozen. and just now thawed.

287
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.206
I'm gonna check his lips
to see if they're chapped.

288
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.966
The creative power of Chinese
food remains undefeated.

289
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.676
Boy. if I had a nickel for every time

290
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.846
I've had a breakthrough
over some moo shu...

291
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.430
Mabel. what the hell are you doing?

292
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.846
It's a piece of paper.

293
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.066
I mean. it's really soggy. but...

294
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.186
Is that the logo of the arconia?

295
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.026
Nicky had arconia
stationery in his mouth? Why?

296
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.406
Well. we'll add that
to our list of questions.

297
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.590
We should start thinking
about getting this body back.

298
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.116
It's 6:45 A.M.

299
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.116
We spent all night autopsying?

300
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.286
Damn you. murder.
for being so interesting!

301
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.456
Okay. we got this. We'll just make sure

302
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.456
we bring his body back
to the dry cleaner's place

303
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.166
- in less than 15.
- Okay.

304
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.756
Well. now it's 14 minutes.

305
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.586
Not helping. Charles.

306
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.526
Okay.

307
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.606
Hi.

308
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.896
- Hi.
- Alright.

309
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.300
How are you?

310
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.996
- It's Oliver.
- That makes sense.

311
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.166
Just headed to the dry cleaners.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

312
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.916
Perfect! I'm in a bit of a time crunch.

313
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.496
Do you mind dropping
off these shirts for me?

314
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.506
I can offer you a free
therapy session in return.

315
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.166
That actually would be nice.

316
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.030
My dga insurance
lapsed in the early '80s.

317
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.396
It's me! I stink!

318
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.840
So. let's all just please drop it! Thanks.

319
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.656
Randall.

320
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.326
The elevator's making that
weird humming noise again.

321
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.906
Okay... no! That's... that's bad.

322
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.586
The sound. is it more like
a "eee." or more like a ""?

323
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.206
Okay.

324
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.376
You know what. let me see
what Lester had to say about that.

325
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.086
Hey. c-could you do
this somewhere else?

326
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.176
Thank you.

327
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.360
Excuse us.

328
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.226
What are you doing?

329
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.306
The ledger that Lester gave him.

330
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.630
it looks like the same paper
that we found in Nicky's mouth.

331
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.726
We've gotta get our hands on that.

332
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.816
You two go. I'll... I'll charm it off him.

333
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.316
- Great plan.
- Yeah.

334
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.366
Wait. did he just stick
us with a dead body

335
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.906
that he brought here?

336
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.706
He's good. He's very good.

337
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.796
Wait. why is there paparazzi here?

338
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.216
They finally found my address.

339
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.876
It's not for you. Charles.

340
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.700
My god.

341
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.926
- Mabel mora?
- Althea?

342
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.516
What are you...

343
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.396
Actually. it's thē now. I shortened it. t-h-ē.

344
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.936
Isn't that just "the"?

345
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.066
No. it's not. 'cause the "ē" has.
like. the little line thingy above it.

346
00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.406
My team thought it would
be easier for my fans.

347
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.276
and they were right.

348
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.866
Ever since the name change...

349
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.930
I'm the number one most
searched artist on wondify.

350
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.956
So brat.

351
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.456
Mabel. I'm gonna... Deliver this laundry.

352
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.246
How is that possible?

353
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.796
'Cause it sounds cool and mysterious.

354
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.716
And also. anytime
anyone searches for a band

355
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.596
that begins with "the."
my name comes up first.

356
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.386
It's genius. right?

357
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.266
I mean. you wanna listen to the Beatles?

358
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.386
"The" comes up.

359
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.726
The spice girls? It's "the" again.

360
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.096
- Yeah.
- The chicks? "The"!

361
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.976
Thank god I was unaffected
by their name change.

362
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.066
But enough about me and my
success. How are you. Mabel?

363
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.856
I am great.

364
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.856
And it's so crazy and wild

365
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.526
that I ran into you.
but I gotta... better run.

366
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.116
My god. you haven't changed a bit.

367
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.580
I'll be seeing you all the time.
I just bought the penthouse.

368
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.086
I'm sorry. you got a
place here in my building?

369
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.916
- Yeah.
- Bought. like an investment.

370
00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.530
or bought. like you're living here?

371
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.636
Living. And do they allow pets?

372
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.806
'Cause I have an
otter. and my last co-op.

373
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.926
they were such dicks about it.

374
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.556
It's bloody Mabel! Bloody Mabel!

375
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.056
Thē! Can we get a
picture of the two of you?

376
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.226
Come on. You'll get used to it. It's fine.

377
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.726
Bloody Mabel! You're amazing!

378
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.346
Really? You're gonna get
DNA on me all over again?

379
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.790
Jesus. I thought you guys
were supposed to be good at this.

380
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.620
Yeah.

381
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.480
What's he doing now?

382
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.900
Yeah?

383
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.360
Jesus!

384
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.620
I'm just fucking with you. I'm dead.

385
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.120
The fuck?

386
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.420
Okay. okay.

387
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.866
Just gimme a minute.
i-I'll... I can look through the...

388
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.956
get back. you animals! Back. I say!

389
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.126
You'll all get your waxed jackets
and new yorker totes in due time!

390
00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.836
Scatter!

391
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.456
Wow.

392
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.166
Thank you. Mr. Putnam.

393
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.086
No problem. champ.

394
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.506
Randall.

395
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.966
Randall. the champ.

396
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.426
I just want to. say that
you're doing such a great job.

397
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.016
Doesn't feel like it.

398
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.106
You're a natural.

399
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.266
You probably don't even need that.

400
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.776
What even is that?

401
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.236
A ledger. Here. just...

402
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.946
You flatter me.
Mr. Putnam. You really do.

403
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.276
You know something?

404
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.616
I wish all the residents
were as kind as you.

405
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.826
I'm not that kind.

406
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.480
Well. you are a friend of doormen.

407
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.810
No. I'm really not. actually.

408
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.546
What are you talking about? You just...

409
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.166
this is the real Oliver Putnam!

410
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.456
Sorry.

411
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.966
And even though. you know. I
have my brownstone in the village.

412
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.046
and my cave upstate.
my team advised me

413
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.506
to buy somewhere more boring.

414
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.136
And I was like. "my
god. duh. The arconia."

415
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.516
It's all old people.

416
00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.766
And Mabel.

417
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.556
You still living with your aunt?

418
00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.896
Yea... no! Actually. I
have my own apartment.

419
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.566
Yeah. it's a studio. but
it has everything I need.

420
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.550
A bed. a spot to record
my podcast. obviously.

421
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.616
You've never heard of my podcast.

422
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.786
Well. they're making a
movie about it. so I don't know.

423
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.916
It might be a big deal.
Eva longoria is playing me.

424
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.086
Wow. I only listen to
podcasts to fall asleep.

425
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.780
- What's yours?
- Only murders in the building.

426
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.926
Are you sure that's what it's called?

427
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.926
'Cause I'm just not
seeing it in the top 10.

428
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.516
You might have to click "see more."

429
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.306
I didn't know that was a thing.

430
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.316
Okay. I'm clicking. I'm
scrolling. I'm scrolling...

431
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.436
Number 17. that's great.

432
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.300
Idea.

433
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.050
What if I came on as a guest?

434
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.850
You'd shoot right to the top.

435
00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.076
Wow. y... you know. I don't think we need

436
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.826
any. you know. shooting anywhere.

437
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.996
We're... we're pretty successful.

438
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.376
Totally.

439
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.256
This is my therapist.
and she is so needy.

440
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.610
We've been playing phone tag
for days. but the offer still stands.

441
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.926
Sandra? Honey. it's okay.

442
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.596
How have you been?

443
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.410
Psst. Mabel. I'm rooting for you.

444
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.856
Trauma's hard. Sandra. We all have it.

445
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.320
"Death alone"?

446
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.990
Isn't that. Pablo neruda?

447
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.756
What?

448
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.466
Big scary mob guy can't like poetry?

449
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.506
- Sorry. I just thought that maybe...
- you know what's funny?

450
00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.886
I spent the last few years
thinking about how fuckin' old I am.

451
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.556
And now that I'm dead.
everybody's gonna be like.

452
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.750
"my god. he died so young."

453
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.606
Not sure that would be the case for me.

454
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.776
Well. you better get a move on. pal.
because death is definitely coming.

455
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.356
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

456
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.380
By the way. why the
fuck did I quit smoking?

457
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.390
"There are lone cemeteries...

458
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.786
"Tombs full of soundless bones.

459
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:32.230
"the heart threading a
tunnel." a dark. dark tunnel.

460
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.926
"Death is drawn to sound."

461
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.676
"Like a slipper without a foot.

462
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.476
"a suit without its wearer.
comes to knock with a ring.

463
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.806
stoneless and fingerless."

464
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.896
Shh!

465
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.356
I thought the body was
supposed to be hanging up.

466
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.446
Who cares? Just
write up what they said.

467
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.236
Time of death. this morning.

468
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.696
Top suspect. caputo crime family.

469
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.656
Less we know. the better.

470
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.430
- What the hell was that?
- Come out with your hands up!

471
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.386
Hey. we must be hearing things.

472
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.530
Let's get out of here before
anyone sees us. alright?

473
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.196
I put Nicky back.

474
00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.496
These cops that found
him are definitely crooked.

475
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.900
- I think there's a cover-up.
- What... Charles. that's huge.

476
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.836
And I'm sorry I left you behind.

477
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.546
No. I enjoyed risking ten years' jail time

478
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.376
in my neighborhood dry cleaners.

479
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.136
But I'm glad you got to
catch up with your friend.

480
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.426
She's not my friend.

481
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.926
She... I mean. she used to be
my friend. but that ended poorly.

482
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.516
She brings out the worst in me.

483
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.606
Just when I'm feeling good about myself.

484
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.476
she moves into the penthouse.

485
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.606
She's literally looking down
on me in my own home.

486
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.776
Screw her! You don't need her.

487
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.156
You got your whole life in front of you.

488
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.366
I. on the other hand. much
like Pablo neruda's poem.

489
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.230
will likely experience "death alone."

490
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.350
That's dark. Are you okay?

491
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.786
Yes.

492
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.496
I got it!

493
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.086
Did you use the old
Oliver Putnam charm

494
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.336
to get it away from him?

495
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.926
S-Something like that. It's a rich text.

496
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.886
There are notes on all the
tenants. birdwatching notes.

497
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.806
There's even a poem about a doorman.

498
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.016
titled "after you."

499
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.266
A journeyman's effort. He tries
to rhyme "cough" with "through."

500
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.750
- The missing page.
- Wait.

501
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.776
Ooh. money amounts.

502
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.326
"Gun. blind." This is juicy.

503
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.706
"Brown-headed cowbird. eurasian Jay.

504
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.496
kākāpō. bowerbird."

505
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.546
Are you kidding me. more bird notes?

506
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.296
So. Nicky had a list of birds in his mouth.

507
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.256
But why are they all in a circle
with dollar amounts under them?

508
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.886
Well. "gun. blind. river."
those are poker terms.

509
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.726
So what. Lester was
working on a bird version

510
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.636
of dogs playing poker?

511
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.976
God. this is more
embarrassing than the poem.

512
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.476
Lester's wife said he liked
comparing people to birds.

513
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.186
So. maybe these are code names

514
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.106
for people he was keeping tabs on?

515
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.736
And those dollar amounts
were what they were betting?

516
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.156
Wow. that's a lot.

517
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.866
Ooh. and things are back to being juicy.

518
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.656
Looks like each page is
a different week's game.

519
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.076
They play Saturday at midnight.

520
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.206
which means there
might be a game tonight.

521
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.626
- We have to go.
- It starts at midnight?

522
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.426
I've already gotten up three
times to pee by midnight.

523
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.966
Well. figure it out. because
the players who were there

524
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.766
the night Nicky and
Lester died might be back.

525
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.056
So. I say we go early.
find a place to hide.

526
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.556
and see who they are.

527
00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.356
Okay. but if we're gonna
infiltrate a midnight game

528
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.146
of New York's scariest
and most powerful mobsters.

529
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.776
first. we must nap.

530
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.130
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

531
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.626
Man. you can do this.
You can do it. man.

532
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.586
Come on. Randall. You can do it.

533
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.506
You got this.

534
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:52.596
- Randall?
- How may I help... Mr. Putnam.

535
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.370
I'm just. returning your ledger.

536
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.816
And I'm... I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding earlier.

537
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.026
Well. you ripped it from my hands.

538
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.340
Yes. the misunderstanding was
you didn't think I would do that.

539
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.050
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.220
No.

541
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.576
The building's falling
apart without Lester.

542
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.626
And to be honest. I didn't
finish my training with him.

543
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.046
so there's no way I can fill his shoes.

544
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.966
Have I ever told you the story about
when sheena Easton played Moses

545
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.386
in my gender-bending musical
twist on the ten commandments?

546
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.976
No. the ledger mentioned
this might happen.

547
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.846
So. okay. it was our opening
night. and a then-unknown sheena

548
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.316
was trying to fill the unfillable
shoes of Mr. Charlton heston.

549
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.946
And it... it... it just went
horribly wrong. People rioted.

550
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.446
And it definitely didn't have
anything to do with the script.

551
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.576
So. I sat her down.

552
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.416
and I told her. "sheena-baneena.
stop trying to be Chuck

553
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.336
and start trying to be fillet mignon."

554
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.796
And from then on. the rest is history.

555
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.086
So. the musical was a success?

556
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.176
I said it was history.

557
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.716
Point is. it's hard to follow a legend.

558
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.096
so stop trying to be Lester.

559
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.386
You can't be somebody you're not.

560
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.806
I still have a lot of follow-up
questions about this musical.

561
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.936
but I think I get what you're trying to say.

562
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.856
Thank you. Mr. Putnam.

563
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.186
And I don't care what
you say. you're a good guy.

564
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.396
Well. thank you.

565
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.946
And. I know this might
be hard to believe.

566
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.866
given my boyish good looks. but.

567
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.680
I've actually lived in
this building quite a while.

568
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.286
So. if you wanted. I
could try and help you

569
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.810
finish some of that training.

570
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.586
- Really?
- Yes.

571
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.256
A-Any question you
have. please come to me.

572
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.716
I actually have a bunch of
questions. Can we start right now?

573
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.926
No. Right now. I have to
take a very important nap.

574
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.976
But. I would say any other time.

575
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.920
I promise. I'm there for ya.

576
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.016
- Thank you. Mr. Putnam.
- You got it.

577
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.776
"Death lies in our beds:"

578
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.616
"In the lazy mattresses.
the black blankets."

579
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.980
"lives a full stretch and
then suddenly blows..."

580
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.416
"Blows sound unknown.
filling out the sheets."

581
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.796
"And there are beds sailing into a harbor"

582
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.926
"where death is waiting.
dressed as an admiral."

583
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.546
Hi.

584
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:37.556
This is anonymous
patient general custer.

585
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.806
and I'm in Dr. Tidyman's trial group.
and I'd like to get the next four doses

586
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:47.186
of 4-8-3-7-6-3-2-8-x-y-t.

587
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.936
And I run out on Thursday.

588
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.066
so I'd like to get it delivered right away.

589
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.486
General custer.

590
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.536
It's good we're getting here early.

591
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.506
People get whole new
identities to hide from the mafia.

592
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.426
and we're breaking laws to see them.

593
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.586
It's locked.

594
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.336
I discovered it opens with a key card.

595
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.370
Give me that.

596
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.080
Finesse.

597
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.526
Wow!

598
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.496
This was really under the
arconia all these years?

599
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.956
Yes. and Lester and
Nicky have both been here.

600
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.746
This room has gotta
hold some answers for us.

601
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.886
Wait. wait. They don't look like mobsters.

602
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.976
Those aren't mobsters. They're CEOs.

603
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.766
Right. I recognize them.

604
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.566
He's the one who invented the one thing.

605
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.816
And didn't she go to space
with Gayle and Oprah?

606
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.260
Here. I'll safari it.

607
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.576
H-t-t-p-slash-slash.

608
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.206
You... you don't have
to type the "http" part.

609
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.786
Give it here. old man.

610
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.506
You don't have to type that either.

611
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.216
Here. I got it.

612
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.546
Okay. so this is tech
billionaire Sebastian steed.

613
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.546
- goes by "bash."
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

614
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.780
That's what I told you. The
guy who invented the thing.

615
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.766
Okay. so the other guy is Jay pflug.

616
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:51.106
Heir of the pflug pharma family.

617
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.646
They make highly addictive drugs

618
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.276
that ruined a lot of people's lives.

619
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.356
They also make my blood pressure
medication. so I'm conflicted.

620
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.316
This is Camila white.

621
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.116
She owns half of New York's hotels.

622
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.996
And god. can she rock
a neutral cashmere.

623
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.616
She's like the human incarnation
of a Nancy meyers kitchen.

624
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.706
Guys. guys. they're all billionaires.

625
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.980
This isn't the mob. this is
the new mob of New York.

626
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.426
Please tell me you recorded that. Okay.

627
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.716
- I need a drink.
- Let's check the bar.

628
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.846
As the city has changed.
so too have those in power.

629
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.146
The "mafia." as we once
knew them. may be no more.

630
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.016
but the idea of many losing

631
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.066
in order for an elite few to
win has never been more true.

632
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.406
Gone are the velour
tracksuits and gold chains.

633
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.326
replaced now by boat
shoes and dogecoin.
