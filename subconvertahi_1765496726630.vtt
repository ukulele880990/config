<i>Where should we go?</i>

3
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:29.964
<i>Couldn't
hear you. What did you say?</i>

4
00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.633
<i>Well.
where should we go?</i>

5
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.368
Hawaii is the obvious choice.

6
00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:38.205
Hawaii is the obvious choice.

7
00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.508
Just think about it. Stop that.

8
00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:43.678
Will you stop and listen to me. please?

9
00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:46.480
There's a reason that
people convalesce at the beach.

10
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:48.850
You'll complain
about sand getting everywhere.

11
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.117
I'll be happy.

12
00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.053
Mmm. Well.
that's what's most important.

13
00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.862
Hurry the hell up. grandpa!

14
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.198
The Rockies are cozy. The
cold isn't bitter there. It's warm.

15
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.502
Cold is just cold. Joan.

16
00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.871
It's the kind of place
you could spend forever.

17
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.907
It's 84 degrees in Naples today.

18
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:14.474
Italy?

19
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.879
- Florida.
- We're not Florida people. Larry.

20
00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.147
Oh. God. Joan. that sounds so snobby.

21
00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.282
We're not Florida people.

22
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.953
You know.
you sound like Karen.

23
00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:27.755
Karen is my friend. and she is not well.

24
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.726
Well. we don't have to make people into
saints ju-just because they're dying.

25
00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:34.028
Jesus. Larry.

26
00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:36.965
Look. it's got mountains
and ice and snow.

27
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.568
So many things for you to
complain about. You will love it.

28
00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:44.204
I don't love to complain.
That's not something people love.

29
00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.708
I don't want to fight. It's a big day.

30
00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.811
You know. people die at these
things? I saw it on the Internet.

31
00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:52.479
It's a gender reveal party.

32
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.016
I mean. I get eliminating
the surprise...

33
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.151
- Can we just let them make a fuss?
- ...but it's not party-worthy.

34
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.489
You know. one of the great joys of my
life has been allowing for surprises.

35
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.359
- Do you... Do you remember...
- Everything has to be a party nowadays.

36
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.795
...when you were convinced
that Zach would be a girl?

37
00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.197
- Everything has to be an event.
- You just don't like parties.

38
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.000
No. No. you just hate having fun.

39
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.435
- Kids have preschool graduations now.
- You're only happy when you're miserable.

40
00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.404
You're five. You don't know anything.

41
00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:21.174
- Look. I... Can we just enjoy it? Okay?
- But. you know. you have the big party.

42
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.343
- Big party.
- Larry!

43
00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.445
Can we just enjoy it. okay?

44
00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:27.849
Asshole!

45
00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.218
I'm enjoying it. I'm
enjoying it. I'm enjoying it.

46
00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:33.788
Joan.

47
00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:34.856
Joan.

48
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.358
- We have to tell them.
- I know.

49
00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:40.160
Just give me today.

50
00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:54.174
Sam. can you grab the balloons?

51
00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.543
Yeah. I heard you. I'm
getting the balloons.

52
00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.411
- We're back.
- Hey. Larry. How's it going?

53
00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.648
- Hi. You look lovely.
- We're back. Ah. the traffic. unbel...

54
00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:02.750
- Oh. hi. How are you. sweetheart?
- Oh. Thank you. Mom.

55
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.418
- Hey. Hey.
- Grandma! Grandma!

56
00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.088
Good to see you. my dears.

57
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.790
Let's go for some cake?

58
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.026
- Sam. the balloons.
- I have the balloons in my hand!

59
00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.730
Thanks for
agreeing to host. Pop-pop.

60
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.665
- This is gonna be a boy.
- How do you know that?

61
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:21.435
Because it's so low. A boy.

62
00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:23.938
So. coming up on 65 years
of marriage. Any tips?

63
00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:26.239
You burst one of those balloons
and you'll never find out!

64
00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.577
Oh! Uh. Nana.

65
00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:32.113
we found a bunch of your
old pictures in the basement.

66
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.514
Thanks. sweetie.

67
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:35.116
Who is that?

68
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.651
Pop-pop was in the army?

69
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.555
No. sweetie. That was Nana's
stupidly attractive first husband.

70
00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.957
Jesus Christ. he's a dapper man.

71
00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:44.391
Why would you leave him for Pop-pop?

72
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.226
No. sweetie.

73
00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.731
Luke was a soldier
and. um. he died at war.

74
00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:52.533
Lar. you got
really lucky. my friend.

75
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.670
I bet he would have been a good dad.

76
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.305
That's not how biology works.

77
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.842
Lar?

78
00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:02.409
Hey. he's being funny.

79
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.578
Shut up. Zach.

80
00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:05.012
- Larry. are you okay?
- Dad?

81
00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:06.981
- Dad?
- Larry! Larry!

82
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.517
Larry!

83
00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.106
Guess you weren't expecting it?

84
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.342
What the hell is going on? Where's Joan?

85
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.212
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.

86
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.047
<i>Please alight the train</i>

87

<i>where your eternity lies ahead.</i>

88
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.484
I don't remember
buying a train ticket.

89
00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:49.289
Well. I guess
the surgery didn't go so well.

90
00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:18.318
<i>Mind your
step. Disorientation is normal.</i>

91

America. arriving in Junction 301.</i>

93
00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:32.033
Hey. All the fun of the Middle Ages
with none of the leprosy. Come on.

94
00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:34.602
Hey. you want to party? Party
all night. party for all time.

95
00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:36.469
Hey. pally. Good to see
you. You must be new.

96
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:37.638
- Where am I?
- Jessica?

97
00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:39.273
He hasn't made contact yet.

98
00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:40.575
Jessica?

99
00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:42.677
- W-What is this?
-  Your AC will be with you shortly.

100
00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:44.645
- Welcome. Sandro. Follow me.
-  Hi. Can you help me? I--

101
00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.379
Your AC will be with you shortly.

102
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.683
- Are you an AC?
- Yes. but I'm not your AC.

103
00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.350
- Come.
- Jessica?

104
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:04.699
<i>Final call for

Hi. Do you work here?

106
00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:13.741
No. honey. I'm here for my health.

107
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:16.110
Listen. I
think I've been abducted.

108
00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.179
You haven't been abducted.

109
00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.381
Well. where's my
family? Where's Joan? Where am I?

110
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.151

115
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:53.781
I know you. Jill.

116
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.083
You just want a box of
Chardonnay and a pool.

117
00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:57.685
I do like Chardonnay.

118
00:06:57.785 --> 00:06:59.887
Well. then I have the eternity for you.

119
00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:00.988
Okay.

120
00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:04.025
Yeah. Okay.

121
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:05.993
Straight ahead.

122
00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:09.397
Oh. Sorry.

123
00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:14.001
You little bitch.

124
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.471
Uh... Larry Cutler?

125
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.608
Is there a Larry Cutler here?

126
00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:22.009
- That's me.
- Larry?

127
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.512
- That's me.
- Oh! Hey. man. I'm so sorry.

128
00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:26.314
They had me at a whole 'nother gate.

129
00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:27.381
Who are you?

130
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.983
I'm Anna. I'm your AC.

131
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.819
- What does that stand for?
- Your afterlife coordinator.

132
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.587
That's not a job.

133
00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:35.056
You've passed away. Larry.

134
00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:36.324
No.

135
00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:37.391
You're dead.

136
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.094
No. I'm not. I-I hit my head. And...

137
00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:42.396
It's a girl.

138
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.831
Walk with me.

139
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.402
Oh. All right. listen. So I
was sitting with my family.

140
00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:49.870
- and then I. uh--
- Died.

141
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.006
No. and I... Whatever
you're trying to pro...

142
00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:54.474
It's not sore. Weird.

143
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:55.776
Look. Larry.

144
00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.447
How is this happening?

145
00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:03.084
When you get here. your form
reverts to its happiest self.

146
00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:04.151
It could be any age.

147
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.987
That's why there are
lots of 10-year-old boys.

148
00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:07.655
but not a lot of teenagers though.

149
00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:10.490
Ah. shit. Joan. Joan. my wife.
I need... I need to go back.

150
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:13.227
Oh. Larry. Look on the bright side.
At least your penis works again.

151
00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:14.662
- Hey. Anna.
- My...

152
00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:16.797
My penis always worked.

153
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.166
There's no need to feel
shame here. We've seen it all.

154
00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:21.302
Uh. Yeah. Well. if I was dead.

155
00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:24.405
I wouldn't really care about
the functionality of my...

156
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.906
- Penis.
- Ugh.

157
00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:29.043
I wouldn't be embarrassed and
annoyed with you right now.

158
00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:32.413
because you're not supposed
to be annoyed in heaven.

159
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.216
Oh. they tell you such
strange things down there.

160
00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:37.952
Larry. what is a soul?

161
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:40.755
Uh...

162
00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:45.626
I don't know. I suppose it's
the perfect version of yourself.

163
00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.862
No. It's just you.

164
00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.565
No. that can't be right.

165
00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:53.167
If you were annoyed a lot in life.

166
00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:54.802
Larry. then you might be
annoyed a lot in death.

167
00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.537
Were you annoyed a lot in life. Larry?

168
00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.005
Listen to me. My wife
really needs me right now.

169
00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.673
I'm sorry. It doesn't work like that.

170
00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:02.676
Wake up. Larry. Wake up. Wake
up. Come on. buddy. Come on.

171
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:04.845
What the hell is that?

172
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.847
If you were dreaming. you
wouldn't feel that pain.

173
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.517
I didn't feel that.

174
00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:11.018
You know. usually you old fellas really
cheer up about the whole penis thing.

175
00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:13.421
Listen to me. I need to talk to
God. okay? That's what I want.

176
00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:16.090
- I want to speak with the big guy.
- Okay. so you're one of those.

177
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.858
I don't know why you didn't
say that in the first place.

178
00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.226
We got tons of eternities.

179
00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.929
What are you. New Testament.
Old Testament? Hindu. Buddhist?

180
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.798
- Pick your poison.
- Hold on. Is God not real?

181
00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:25.132
I don't know. But. listen.

182
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.068
after a couple hundred years
in one of these eternities.

183
00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:28.869
you won't even know the difference.

184
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.305
Who do you work for?

185
00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:32.541
I work for Frank.

186
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.241
Okay. then. uh. who does Frank work for?

187
00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:37.178
Frank works for Tom. Why-Why
does it even matter? Come on.

188
00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:40.214
We don't have time. I got
other clients. Larry. please.

189
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:43.617
Okay. Well.

190
00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:48.222
I'm sorry for assuming that paradise
would look a little less like life.

191
00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:49.390
This isn't paradise.

192
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.426
This is just a brief transition
between life and eternity.

193
00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:54.829
Oh. you've earned a
life worth an eternity.

194
00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:57.598
- I have?
- It's just something we say.

195
00:09:57.698 --> 00:09:59.300
Everybody gets an eternity.

196
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.102
The good. the bad and the ugly.

197
00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:04.171
So all that "live a good life"
stuff's a-a bunch of crap?

198
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.239
Afraid so.

199
00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.576
<i>Red door escapee.</i>

200
00:10:07.675 --> 00:10:09.043
- Get away from me!
<i>- Do not engage.</i>

201
00:10:09.143 --> 00:10:10.878
- Oh. that? Don't worry about that.
- Get away!

202
00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:13.314
Just don't run
through any red doors.

203
00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.683
I can't go back.
I can't do it anymore.

204
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.919
Come here. Come...

205
00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.021
- Get off me.
- Larry. let's go. Let's go.

<i>Final
call for Alpine World. 234.</i>

207
00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:29.930
So this is where I'm staying. huh?

208
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.500
For now. until you choose
the right eternity for you.

209
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:34.101
But we'll get into all that later.

210
00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:39.773
- I think now's a good time. I'm dead.
- Hey. There you go. Acceptance.

211
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.843
We have some of your favorite
clothes in the closet.

212
00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.745

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:54.021

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.381
Hi. there.

228
00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:29.149
Hi.

229
00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.520
Confusing time. huh?

230
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.189
Yes. actually.

231
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.629
Oh. S-Sorry. I'm... I'm married.

232
00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.164
What if I. uh. told you

233
00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:47.001
I could secure you a spot
in the hottest eternity...

234
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:50.538
Marge. You know the policy.
No selling in the bar.

235
00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:54.341
No selling in the bar.

236
00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:02.416
Something strong. please.

237
00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:03.851
First day?

238
00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.087
So what are you. like
an angel or something?

239
00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:08.122
Oh. no. no.

240
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:10.291
I'm a bartender.

241
00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:13.427
Oh. shit. Do I have to get a job?

242
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.697
Only if you want to stay here.

243
00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:19.867
So what are you thinking about.
for where you want to go from here?

244
00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:23.571
Oh.

245
00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:26.775
I don't... I don't know.

246
00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:29.544
Somewhere sunny with a beach. I guess.

247
00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:33.147
But my wife won't like that.
so I can't stay for long.

248
00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:36.150
Did your AC go over the rules?

249
00:13:36.584 --> 00:13:38.285
No. but. uh. she seemed busy.

250
00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:40.087
All right. Well. look. the big thing

251
00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:42.356
is there's no switching
eternities after you've chosen.

252
00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:44.726
No visiting other
eternities. no nothing.

253
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.827
Eternity is eternity.

254
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.596
It's forever.

255
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:52.032
What if I didn't go along with the rules?
What are they gonna do. kill me again?

256
00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:53.867
Technically they can't kill you again.

257
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.202
But you break a rule.

258
00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:58.405
you overstay your welcome. or
you try switching eternities.

259
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.608
they'll put you into the void.

260
00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:02.476
Is that like hell?

261
00:14:02.577 --> 00:14:03.844
As close as there is.

262
00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.549
It's just blackness. for eternity.

263
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:10.918
Um...

264
00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:15.856
My wife has cancer. It's terminal.

265
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.626
I'm sorry to hear that.

266
00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:22.262
Worst part about death is the guilt
you feel for the ones you left behind.

267
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.966
I know. and I told her that I
was always gonna take care of her.

268
00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.069
And now she's sick. and
dealing with all this.

269
00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.205
Um... Could I get a mixer with that?

270
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.973
That is absolutely disgusting.

271
00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:38.479
Morning. sleepyhead.

272
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.880
Morning. sweetie.

273
00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.353
What the hell?

274
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.355
What's going on? How
did you get in here?

275
00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:50.525
- Larry. you don't remember?
- Remember what?

276
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.661
No. we didn't. Did we?

277
00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:55.797
Nah. I'm just joking. I have a key.

278
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.431
- Why do you have a key?
- It's not important.

279
00:14:57.532 --> 00:15:00.434
So. you seemed to have
a good time last night.

280
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:03.370
I'm dead. You wouldn't think
hangovers would be a thing.

281
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.006
I know. right? It's a
common misconception.

282
00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:08.909
I got a question.

283
00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.545
Mm-hmm. Hit me with it.

284
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.984
So. everyone working here. they don't
want to go to their eternity. Why?

285
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:20.020
Some people haven't accepted death.

286
00:15:20.522 --> 00:15:23.457
and some people are waiting
for their loved ones.

287
00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:24.726
Oh.

288
00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:28.696
And others haven't decided yet.
and those are the worst ones.

289
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.365
Well. why did you stay?

290
00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:34.736
That is a
story for another time.

291
00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:36.671
- Mmm.
- So. tell me.

292
00:15:37.404 --> 00:15:39.373
Where you going? Did you decide?

293
00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:45.045
No. I... I need to see where Joan is.

294
00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:47.615
- Mmm.
- How can I tell how close she is?

295
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:50.518
No. I'm sorry. It doesn't work
like that. I can't do that.

296
00:15:50.618 --> 00:15:53.621
So all that looking down from above
stuff. that's just a bunch of BS?

297
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.289
Mmm. You're annoyed?

298
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.825
- No. I'm not annoyed.
- You look annoyed.

299
00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:59.059
What about everybody who died
before me? Where's my parents?

300
00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.360
How do I see them?

301
00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.896
You could definitely
go see your parents.

302
00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.231
But then. you know.
you'd be...

303
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:06.634
- Be with my parents for eternity.
- Eternity.

304
00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:10.872
That's why we usually
recommend for you to do you.

305
00:16:11.606 --> 00:16:14.107
And just know that everyone
is existing pretty damn good.

306
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:15.442
You know what I mean?

307
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.082
You know. Joan always thought of death

308
00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.853
as one more surprise
waiting around the corner.

309
00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:26.554
- Mmm.
- And she loved surprises.

310
00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:28.222
But she was a librarian though. right?

311
00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:29.924
Yeah. they can like surprises too.

312
00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:31.191
Oh.

313
00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:34.629
So if I wanted to wait.
what do I have to do?

314
00:16:34.729 --> 00:16:36.163
Get a job? Be a bartender?

315
00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:39.132
No. You wish.
It's cleaning work.

316
00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:41.468
- Do you know how to do laundry?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.138
At least the room is nice.

318
00:16:45.974 --> 00:16:48.910
Yeah. But it's for clients.

319
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.980
So if you don't decide. then you
have to go...

320
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.280
Well. I was told there is no hell.

321
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.950
- The basement.
- Oh.

322
00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:58.051
The rooms are more
functional in the basement.

323
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.354
- Mmm.
- Jesus. you went straight to hell.

324
00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:04.491
You look like you
hate people. Try Hermit World.

325
00:17:04.592 --> 00:17:06.628
Hi. Excuse me...

326
00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:09.697
Do you want a little sniffle? And you?

327
00:17:17.005 --> 00:17:20.708
<i>Final call
for Cowboy World 167.</i>

328
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:28.115
Smoke. sir?

329
00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:32.887
It could be tomorrow.

330
00:17:32.987 --> 00:17:36.223
Or she could hang on for
another. what. six or seven months?

331
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:38.726
I mean. I guess I could
set everything up for her.

332
00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:41.896
And I could. you know. make sure
it's... it's how she likes it.

333
00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:43.831
really make it feel like a home.

334
00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:46.233
Larry. that is so romantic.

335
00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:50.270
- I guess it is a little romantic.
- It's so romantic.

336
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.740
- I can be romantic.
- I...

337
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.543
- 'Cause I know how she likes things.
- You do.

338
00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:44.025
Oh.

339
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.392
I really think you picked a good one.

340
00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:46.995
You are not going to regret this. Larry.

341
00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:50.098
- Hey. hey. uh. would you do me a favor?
- Yeah. sure can do.

342
00:18:50.632 --> 00:18:52.066
Could you give Joan this letter for me?

343
00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.801
No can do. That's against the rules.

344
00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:55.837
Plus. why do you need a
letter when you got me?

345
00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:59.540
<i>Beach Land 239.
now boarding at gate 12.</i>

346
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.441
It was a pleasure working with you.

347
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:02.510
Yeah.

348
00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:07.849
Bye.

349
00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.518
Bye.

350
00:19:12.987 --> 00:19:14.722
Sorry. Oh.

351
00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:16.891
Ow.

352
00:19:19.794 --> 00:19:20.762
Shoot.

353
00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.362
Okay.

354
00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:34.474
<i>Mind your step.
Disorientation is normal.</i>

355
00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:42.684
Joan.

356
00:19:42.784 --> 00:19:43.918
Joan!

357
00:19:44.752 --> 00:19:46.219
Joan! Joan!

358
00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:48.288
That's my wife.

359
00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:49.757
Yeah. Come on. buddy.

360
00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:52.727
- It's that way.
- Yeah. okay. Yeah. yeah.

361
00:19:54.829 --> 00:19:57.264
Come on. come on. come on.
come on! Come on.

362
00:19:58.866 --> 00:19:59.801
There you go.

363
00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:01.969
<i>The newly dead
from North America.</i>

364
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.639
<i>arriving in Junction 301.</i>

365
00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:10.011
Oh. excuse me. Excuse
me. Sorry. where am I?

366
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:12.212
Um. your AC will explain everything.

367
00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:14.749
Okay. Okay. You know.
it's just...

368
00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:17.852
Honey. your AC will explain everything.

369
00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.458
That looks nice.

370
00:20:24.826 --> 00:20:27.327
Joan. Joan! Joan.

371
00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:28.696
- Larry!
- Joan.

372
00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:31.999
- Sweetie. Ah. sweetie.
- Oh. my God.

373
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.366
I missed you so much.

374
00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:36.971
- Hi. Oh. Oh. my God.
- Wow. look at you. Wow. I love this.

375
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:41.109
I was. uh. I was in bed. and then
I... I thought I just came from a...

376
00:20:41.209 --> 00:20:42.409
- Baby. you look amazing.
-  ...a-a train.

377
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.779
- Oh! Every time!
- Ow! Ow!

378
00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:48.549
God. every damn time. Larry. I told
you to slow down on the pretzels.

379
00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:50.484
- But. you... No. no. you never listen.
- I know. I know.

380
00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:51.953
Oh. you stop smiling.

381
00:20:52.053 --> 00:20:53.121
- Jo?
- Yeah.

382
00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:54.956
Listen to me. honey.
I have shocking news.

383
00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:56.090
- You're dead.
- I'm dead.

384
00:20:56.524 --> 00:20:57.859
Yeah. How'd you know?

385
00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:58.860
I mean...

386
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.361
It took him forever to figure that out.

387
00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.197
- Not forever.
- Yeah. forever.

388
00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:06.299
- No.
- So you are the famous Joan.

389
00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:09.237
Okay. Larry. Way to marry up.

390
00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:12.206
- Yeah.
-  So. uh. what-what now?

391
00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:13.273
Yeah. so
now. so--

392
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:14.675
Was it cancer?

393
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.712
That took you away from the world?

394
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:19.781
So. who are you?

395
00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:22.817
Okay. honey. So listen. now we
finally get to have that holiday.

396
00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.153
And basically we can go anywhere
we want. but then that's it.

397
00:21:25.253 --> 00:21:27.789
It's like a one and done thing
here. They're very strict on that.

398
00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:29.824
Um. and if you want to go
to the mountains we can.

399
00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:33.094
because the snow and the cold's not
gonna kill you now. 'cause you're dead.

400
00:21:33.194 --> 00:21:35.096
- Back away from my client.
- I'm not near your client.

401
00:21:35.196 --> 00:21:36.531
- Back away.
- Shut up.

402
00:21:36.631 --> 00:21:38.431
I've been waiting for this
golden goose for 67 goddamn years.

403
00:21:38.533 --> 00:21:39.767
- Oh. Lar?
- Hi.

404
00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:41.903
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry about her.

405
00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:43.104
Who's that?

406
00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:45.305
I'm Ryan.
I'm your afterlife coordinator.

407
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:46.439
Yeah.

408
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.609
I know this can be
very. very overwhelming.

409
00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:50.511
It's a lot to absorb. so
I highly recommend just...

410
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:55.016
...taking a deep breath
in. and... ...out.

411
00:21:55.116 --> 00:21:57.018
Just breathe out.

412
00:22:31.085 --> 00:22:32.452
Oh. Hey. What's going on. guy?

413
00:22:32.553 --> 00:22:34.288
This was my. uh. bartender.

414
00:22:34.387 --> 00:22:37.424
I. um. guess I forgot to pay the tab.
I didn't realize there would be a tab.

415
00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:38.826
Nobody gave me any money.

416
00:22:39.894 --> 00:22:42.663
No way.

417
00:22:42.763 --> 00:22:44.632
Sorry. I forgot to ask your
name. What's your name again?

418
00:22:44.732 --> 00:22:46.133
I'm Luke.

419
00:22:46.234 --> 00:22:47.735
This is Luke. He's my bartender.

420
00:22:49.003 --> 00:22:50.437
Joan.

421
00:22:51.005 --> 00:22:52.139
Oh. no.

422
00:22:53.774 --> 00:22:56.510
I never dreamt you this clearly.

423
00:22:57.778 --> 00:22:59.714
You're exactly how I dreamt you.

424
00:22:59.814 --> 00:23:01.916
Oof. Hard luck. Larry.

425
00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:05.553
No. Luke had a mustache.

426
00:23:05.653 --> 00:23:07.288
Yeah. well. Joanie hated it.

427
00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:10.358
So I shave it off every morning
hoping she's gonna show up.

428
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:13.393
- Oh. my God.
- How romantic.

429
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.131
And you did.

430
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.967
Okay. sweetie.

431
00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:22.536
- Okay.
- Oh.

432
00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:24.138
- What you doing?
- Larry?

433
00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:25.573
- Okay. sweetie.
- I...

434
00:23:25.673 --> 00:23:26.774
- Let's go.
- Oh.

435
00:23:26.874 --> 00:23:28.441
- Who's this guy?
- The second husband.

436
00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:31.245
- I prefer current husband.
- The current husband.

437
00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:34.148
- Oh.
- Joanie. you're all right?

438
00:23:34.949 --> 00:23:35.917
Oh. my God.

439
00:23:36.017 --> 00:23:38.485
Honey. It was a lot for me too.

440
00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:42.455
Okay. I have to insist that I explain
exactly what's going on to my client.

441
00:23:42.556 --> 00:23:47.995
She clearly has a very
"difficult" decision to make.

442
00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:50.564
- Okay. Oh. that...
- Come on.

443
00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:53.834
- Oh. my God. he's really here.
- And very attractive.

444
00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:55.770
Is he taller?

445
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.105
So when you said you were waiting...

446
00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.275
I conjured her image
every day in my mind.

447
00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:06.914
Thought I did a good job. but
she's more stunning than I remember.

448
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.884
Okay. That's a line. Luke.

449
00:24:10.718 --> 00:24:12.153
You were my bartender.

450
00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:15.488
Hmm?

451
00:24:15.589 --> 00:24:19.026
Nope. Nope. Nope.

452
00:24:20.528 --> 00:24:22.430
- Uh. mmm no.
- God. he looked so young.

453
00:24:23.064 --> 00:24:24.565
This will have to do.

454
00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:26.801
Was he always that young?

455
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:28.536
That's a lot to take in.

456
00:24:28.636 --> 00:24:31.973
The love of your life waiting 67 years.

457
00:24:32.073 --> 00:24:33.341
And Larry.

458
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.076
Larry is my husband.

459
00:24:35.176 --> 00:24:37.044
- One of two.
- Yeah.

460
00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:37.979
Oh. that's pretty.

461
00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:39.613
You'll feel much better after you

462
00:24:39.714 --> 00:24:41.415
change out of that morbid ensemble.

463
00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:44.552
Ah. Oh. Oh.

464
00:24:44.652 --> 00:24:45.987
Yeah. that's pretty.

465
00:24:46.087 --> 00:24:48.322
That's... Oh. he's so young.

466
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.192
Oh. he's so young.
Oh. I don't...

467
00:24:51.292 --> 00:24:52.727
What's your ETA. doll?

468
00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:55.663
- Oh.
- How's it looking?

469
00:24:57.565 --> 00:24:59.266
So... What...

470
00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:01.202
What am I supposed to do. huh?

471
00:25:01.569 --> 00:25:04.005
- I need you to tell me...
- ...what to do.

472
00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:07.008
Oh. my dear. Okay. I read your file.

473
00:25:07.441 --> 00:25:10.077
And you are smart.
passionate and decisive.

474
00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.812
Oh. I am?

475
00:25:12.313 --> 00:25:15.816
I have complete faith that you
will choose the right eternity...

476
00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:19.020
- Yeah.
- ...and the right person to spend it with.

477
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.588
- Mmm.
- You'll do.

478
00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:22.990
Do for what?

479
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:25.493
Were you expecting someone. or...

480
00:25:25.593 --> 00:25:26.994
Were you?

481
00:25:27.995 --> 00:25:30.197
Uh...

482
00:25:30.297 --> 00:25:33.901
Oh. my God. Luke. What
a surprise.

483
00:25:34.535 --> 00:25:35.970
What the hell. Reese?

484
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.873
It's Ryan. and it's been
Ryan for the last half hour.

485
00:25:38.973 --> 00:25:41.675
- Yeah.
- You look amazing.

486
00:25:41.776 --> 00:25:43.744
Yeah. I'm married.

487
00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:45.679
- To him.
- To Larry.

488
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.581
And Larry seems nice.

489
00:25:47.681 --> 00:25:51.919
Look. Joan. you must have thought.
or hoped. that this might happen?

490
00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:56.257
Well. I mean. yeah. Yeah. yeah.
You know. I-I have imagined it.

491
00:25:56.357 --> 00:25:57.825
Great.

492
00:25:58.392 --> 00:25:59.894
Hi.

493
00:25:59.994 --> 00:26:01.996
- I'll leave you kids to it.
- Oh.

494
00:26:02.096 --> 00:26:03.130
Hi.

495
00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:07.301
Did you even read my file?

496
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:09.837
You're more than words on a page to
me. buddy. You didn't even bring it up.

497
00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:11.872
Yeah. well. I had a lot
on my mind. I just died.

498
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:16.010
So. I'm sorry that I forgot to mention
that my wife's ex might be hanging around.

499
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.812
Technically. I don't think
we can call him her ex.

500
00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:19.413
First husband. maybe. but not an ex.

501
00:26:19.514 --> 00:26:21.516
No. I'm not calling...
I'm never calling him that.

502
00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:24.752
Okay. I'm just trying to anticipate
what Ryan's gonna say. We have history.

503
00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:26.053
Great. What kind of history?

504
00:26:26.153 --> 00:26:28.889
- It was sexual.
- Of course it was.

505
00:26:28.989 --> 00:26:31.992
You know how many people wanted
this case? So many people.

506
00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:33.060
Really?

507
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.796
A man that's waited half
a century for his love? Ah!

508
00:26:35.896 --> 00:26:37.264
That's kinda sad if you think about it.

509
00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:39.433
You really think that's the way
that Joan's gonna think about it?

510
00:26:39.934 --> 00:26:41.735
- I don't know.
- It's okay.

511
00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:43.604
I'm sure they've had
one of these before.

512
00:26:43.704 --> 00:26:45.507
I mean. I don't know about
it. I've never had it.

513
00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:47.808
But I bet you there's a process.

514
00:26:47.908 --> 00:26:50.411
- He looks like Montgomery Clift.
- Oof!

515
00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:52.980
Oh. my gosh. I was saying
this just the other day.

516
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.983
Montgomery Clift. He is so handsome.

517
00:26:56.083 --> 00:26:58.520
- Luke is so handsome.
- You're not helping.

518
00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:01.455
I'm sorry. but it is what it is.

519
00:27:01.556 --> 00:27:02.923
Luke is hot.

520
00:27:03.023 --> 00:27:06.060
His eyes are bluer than the
ocean. He has a better narrative.

521
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.294
No. he doesn't.

522
00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.496
I have a better narrative.

523
00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:11.600
I was married to her for 65
years and I gave her children.

524
00:27:11.699 --> 00:27:14.301
Exactly. We go with that. That's strong.

525
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:16.571
There's nothing more powerful
than emotional blackmail.

526
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.805
- Right?
- Good on ya.

527
00:27:21.008 --> 00:27:24.011
So... ...how have you been?

528
00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:26.881
Good. Yeah.

529
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:31.218
Well. I mean. I've been obviously
dead. but. you know. good.

530
00:27:32.554 --> 00:27:34.722
- Well. you look good.
- Yeah.

531
00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:36.591
I mean. you know. you
always... you always looked...

532
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.027
- You always looked good.
- Oh. yeah. Coming from you. huh?

533
00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:42.029
Oh. Oh.

534
00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:47.201
Oh.

535
00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.038
Yeah. I. uh...

536
00:27:54.008 --> 00:27:57.512
Look. I-I don't know what
to say. It's...

537
00:27:57.612 --> 00:27:59.914
Well. I had a long time to think
about what I was going to say.

538
00:28:00.014 --> 00:28:02.316
- Oh.
- I mean. I had a long. long time.

539
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:03.884
And?

540
00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:06.687
And I'm drawing a blank.

541
00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:08.289
Oh.

542
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:10.191
<i>Warning. Code seven four. </i>

543
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:11.825
- Code seven four.
- Oh! Oh.

544
00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:13.360
- Eyes on the bogey.
- What the hell?

545
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.895
Gary.

546
00:28:14.995 --> 00:28:16.931
Hey. Luke. You working tonight?

547
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:18.600
Not tonight. Tonight's a night off.

548
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:21.135
Wait. Is this...

549
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.637
Mm-hmm.

550
00:28:22.736 --> 00:28:25.839
Joan? No!

551
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.842
- No. No. please.
- Move it!

552
00:28:28.943 --> 00:28:31.111
I can't look at
another goddamn painting.

553
00:28:31.212 --> 00:28:32.614
- It's so boring.
- All right.

554
00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:34.014
- Well. I better go.
- No!

555
00:28:34.114 --> 00:28:36.083
- But. hey. you are one lucky lady.
- Hmm?

556
00:28:36.183 --> 00:28:37.151
Gary!

557
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:38.485
- Oh.
- Huh.

558
00:28:38.587 --> 00:28:40.321
- Move it. I'm sick of this crap.
- No. please!

559
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:41.690
Get in here now!

560
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:42.856
Oof.

561
00:28:42.957 --> 00:28:44.526
Museum World's the worst!

562
00:28:44.626 --> 00:28:46.260
Oh. God.

563
00:28:47.127 --> 00:28:50.231
Oh. my God. What-What did he do?

564
00:28:50.331 --> 00:28:52.601
Oh. he tried to escape his eternity.

565
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.604
Once you've chosen.
you can't go back here.

566
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.471
You have to get it right.

567
00:28:58.105 --> 00:29:00.474
- Oh. that's a lot of pressure.
- Yeah. it is.

568
00:29:00.575 --> 00:29:03.877
Look. I remembered what I
wanted to say to you first.

569
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.379
What?

570
00:29:06.581 --> 00:29:07.748
I love you.

571
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.218
Oh.

572
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.255
That's a... That's a good opener.

573
00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:15.557
Yeah.

574
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.527
Look. I know this is hard
for you. but I missed you.

575
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:22.963
I thought about you every single day.

576
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.534
There wasn't a day that went
by that I didn't think of you.

577
00:29:28.068 --> 00:29:31.205
Yeah. You know. I...

578
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.274
I wanted you to be happy.

579
00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:35.442
I wanted you to have a life.

580
00:29:36.844 --> 00:29:38.779
- Yeah?
- Yeah. of course.

581
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.415
But I waited.

582
00:29:41.516 --> 00:29:46.320
You know. I-I waited because I wanted
us to have a chance to have one too.

583
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.122
Oh.

584
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:50.491
I'm gonna be sick.

585
00:29:50.592 --> 00:29:52.459
- You okay?
- Oh. God. Why can you get sick here?

586
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.596
- Joan.
- Oh.

587
00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:56.297
- You all right?
- Uh. Luke? Luke. please.

588
00:29:56.397 --> 00:29:57.666
I need to think.

589
00:29:57.766 --> 00:30:00.000
Okay?

590
00:30:11.513 --> 00:30:12.479
Oh.

591
00:30:13.347 --> 00:30:14.315
Okay.

592
00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:26.193
Luke?

593
00:30:27.127 --> 00:30:28.095
Oh.

594
00:30:29.731 --> 00:30:31.832
Okay.

595
00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:39.507
- Hey. sweetie.
- Oh. Larry.

596
00:30:39.607 --> 00:30:42.644
So. I know this is a lot. but don't
worry. I've been doing the research.

597
00:30:42.744 --> 00:30:44.579
And here are some pretty good options.

598
00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:45.714
Sorry. options for?

599
00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:47.114
Yeah. for our eternity.

600
00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:48.949
What?

601
00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:51.919
Wow. You really look amazing.

602
00:30:52.019 --> 00:30:54.054
- The long hair suits you. I love it.
- Oh.

603
00:30:54.154 --> 00:30:55.155
What?

604
00:30:55.255 --> 00:30:57.391
Oh. Everything works here.

605
00:30:57.925 --> 00:30:59.393
Oh. Larry.

606
00:30:59.493 --> 00:31:01.895
- What do you mean. "Larry"?
- Well. it's complicated.

607
00:31:01.995 --> 00:31:03.497
We were together a week ago.

608
00:31:03.598 --> 00:31:07.101
Yeah. well. a lot has happened in a
week. You died. Karen died. I died.

609
00:31:07.201 --> 00:31:10.437
I just been reunited
with both of my dead husbands.

610
00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:13.407
And I learned that I have only a
week to pick where to spend eternity.

611
00:31:13.508 --> 00:31:16.343
Karen finally kicked it.
It's a big week for Oakdale.

612
00:31:16.443 --> 00:31:17.411
Oh.

613
00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:19.446
Oh.

614
00:31:19.547 --> 00:31:20.782
Hey.

615
00:31:21.683 --> 00:31:24.218
- I know what'll make you feel better.
- Oh. what?

616
00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:25.352
Squatting.

617
00:31:25.452 --> 00:31:26.788
Oh. Jesus Christ.

618
00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:28.255
Just try it.

619
00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:30.792
- Fine. Okay.
- I'm telling you.

620
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:31.826
- Come on. Go.
- Okay. fine.

621
00:31:33.193 --> 00:31:34.161
Go.

622
00:31:35.864 --> 00:31:36.964
Yeah.

623
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:39.133
- Wow.
- I know. right?

624
00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:42.002
- I got so low there.
- You did get so low there.

625
00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:44.371
Yeah. I know. It feels so good.

626
00:31:45.906 --> 00:31:47.141
I've been doing a bunch of stuff.

627
00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:49.143
- Oh. Looking good.
- Yeah.

628
00:31:49.243 --> 00:31:51.713
- You look good.
- I know. Thanks. Thanks.

629
00:31:51.813 --> 00:31:53.815
- Work it out.
- I miss these hips.

630
00:31:53.914 --> 00:31:55.750
- Whoo!
- Oh. God.

631
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.951
Yeah. look at this. Look at this.

632
00:31:59.754 --> 00:32:04.425
Oh. You were right. That. uh.
that did make me feel better.

633
00:32:04.526 --> 00:32:05.593
I knew it would.

634
00:32:05.693 --> 00:32:07.695
Oh.

635
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:12.132
Are you kidding me?

636
00:32:12.232 --> 00:32:13.902
- Larry!
- It's too much salt.

637
00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:16.671
I need... I need time.

638
00:32:17.371 --> 00:32:19.072
Okay? I...

639
00:32:20.174 --> 00:32:22.009
I just... I need to clear my head.

640
00:32:22.109 --> 00:32:25.212
Okay. You're right.
I'm being insensitive.

641
00:32:26.246 --> 00:32:28.015
And we can talk about it in the morning.

642
00:32:28.382 --> 00:32:29.983
- Thank you.
- Okay.

643
00:32:42.463 --> 00:32:44.097
- These are so stupid.
- Are you kidding me?

644
00:32:44.198 --> 00:32:45.600
What are you doing?

645
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.768
I'm going to bed.

646
00:32:46.868 --> 00:32:48.268
I'm tired too.

647
00:32:48.969 --> 00:32:50.137
Long day for me.

648
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:02.249
Oh.

649
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.154
Oh. Larry.

650
00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:11.158
Oh.

651
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:21.636
<i>Remember. geopolitical
differences no longer matter.</i>

652
00:33:21.736 --> 00:33:22.704
<i>You are dead.</i>

653
00:33:24.037 --> 00:33:26.574
Sorry. buddy. but
your seven days are up.

654
00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:37.986
Holy crap.

655
00:33:38.085 --> 00:33:39.821
"Holy crap. For God's
sakes. Bloody hell."

656
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:41.656
Are you sure you're not religious?

657
00:33:41.756 --> 00:33:42.824
Hey. hey. hey. Is he here?

658
00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:45.225
Oh. yeah. he is. But it's sad actually.

659
00:33:45.325 --> 00:33:47.662
No. he's... He-He's my Jo's favorite.

660
00:33:48.161 --> 00:33:49.731
- Him?
- Yeah. She loves him.

661
00:33:49.831 --> 00:33:51.131
- Really?
- He's the best.

662
00:33:51.699 --> 00:33:52.767
Oh. okay.

663
00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:53.868
Hey. do you know him?

664
00:33:53.968 --> 00:33:55.202
Yeah. of course I know him.

665
00:33:55.302 --> 00:33:56.604
Would he do you a favor?

666
00:33:56.704 --> 00:33:59.406
Who you talking to?
It's me. Obviously. duh.

667
00:33:59.507 --> 00:34:01.308
- But you're sure? Him?
- Yes.

668
00:34:01.408 --> 00:34:02.409
Okay.

669
00:34:02.944 --> 00:34:05.947
Wow. Look at this.

670
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.850
Single bed. That's nice. right?

671
00:34:09.216 --> 00:34:11.953
We got ourselves here a kitchenette.

672
00:34:12.052 --> 00:34:13.153
Handy.

673
00:34:13.253 --> 00:34:14.923
Let's see what's in that fridge.

674
00:34:15.023 --> 00:34:16.256
Oh. my gosh.

675
00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:18.793
You are in luck.

676
00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:19.928
Hummus.

677
00:34:20.028 --> 00:34:21.395
You know what? It's fine.

678
00:34:21.763 --> 00:34:24.331
You sort this out for me.
I'll be outta here in no time.

679
00:34:24.431 --> 00:34:25.967
- Oh. I love it.
- This is gonna save it.

680
00:34:26.066 --> 00:34:27.401
I love it. You are focused.

681
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:29.403
- Keeping your eyes on the prize.
- What's that smell?

682
00:34:29.504 --> 00:34:31.573
- It's hummus.
- No. it's not.

683
00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:50.992
I...

684
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:03.771
All right.

685
00:35:03.871 --> 00:35:06.373
<i>Ever think 1930s Germany</i>

686
00:35:06.473 --> 00:35:09.711
<i>would've been great if it

Oh.

690
00:35:23.223 --> 00:35:25.392
Okay. Please be coffee.

Oh. Larry.

692
00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:29.396
I know. I know. but I
got a surprise for you.

693
00:35:29.496 --> 00:35:32.499
No. no. no. I actually
need less surprises.

694
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.003
Like. just. you know. zero surprises.

695
00:35:35.103 --> 00:35:37.038
Joan. I promise you're gonna like this.

696
00:35:37.137 --> 00:35:38.271
You trust me. right?

697
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.675
Yeah. Okay.

698
00:35:41.776 --> 00:35:42.744
Yeah.

699
00:35:44.012 --> 00:35:45.145
She trusts me.

- Thanks. honey.
- Yeah.

703
00:35:53.153 --> 00:35:54.555
Are you excited?

704
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:57.692
- Sure.
- Got any ideas what it could be?

705
00:35:58.059 --> 00:35:59.359
No.

706
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:01.763

Okay. yeah. I
think we got it--

763
00:38:16.264 --> 00:38:18.566
I don't know what that guy was
doing. And why are you going--

764
00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:20.067
- What is wrong with you?
- I know. I'm trying.

765
00:38:20.168 --> 00:38:21.769
I thought it was the real
Dean Martin. I swear to God.

766
00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:24.437
- What's your problem?
- Stop! Stop it!

767
00:38:28.576 --> 00:38:29.944
You two. come with me.

768
00:38:30.477 --> 00:38:32.280
No. No. no. no. no. no. no.

769
00:38:32.379 --> 00:38:34.615
You two st... You stay here.

770
00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:38.119
Excuse me. y'all. Excuse me.

771
00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:39.987
Excuse me.

772
00:38:40.087 --> 00:38:41.088
You're excused.

773
00:38:43.024 --> 00:38:44.826
You know. I could've
handled that myself.

774
00:38:44.926 --> 00:38:45.893
Yeah.

775
00:38:47.028 --> 00:38:47.995
Yeah.

776
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.566
Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:55.536
You know. my grandfather.
he had psychotic issues.

778
00:38:55.636 --> 00:39:00.541
And maybe it just skips a generation.
Because there's no way that this is real.

779
00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:05.713
How in God's name can this
be real? My God.

780
00:39:07.315 --> 00:39:08.448
Is this hell?

781
00:39:09.449 --> 00:39:11.152
Is this hell?

782
00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:13.688
- Technically. hell does--
- No. no! I didn't say speak.

783
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.760
You ever work this place out?

784
00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:23.231
Nah. It just gets more
and more confusing.

785
00:39:23.331 --> 00:39:27.301
<i>Do not be alarmed.
Everything is as it should be.</i>

786
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.003
Gimme your phone. Just give it to me.

787
00:39:29.103 --> 00:39:32.607
Hey. honey. So we're talking about
bending the rules just a smidge.

788
00:39:32.707 --> 00:39:34.976
- It was my idea.
- It was my idea.

789
00:39:35.076 --> 00:39:38.779
I took his idea and
I made it better. I'm making a plan.

790
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.248
Oh.
it's about control?

791
00:39:40.348 --> 00:39:41.816
Yep. Yep.

792
00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:55.930
Oh.

793
00:40:06.507 --> 00:40:08.276
- So?
- Good news.

794
00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:10.878
- I talked to Frank. and basically--
- Actually. I talked to Frank.

795
00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:12.780
The point is. somebody talked to Frank.

796
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.449
They then talked to Tom. and then
they talked to a guy way up top.

797
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.319
- The big guy.
- Kevin.

798
00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:20.321
And you got approved for a plan.

799
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.589
Anna. just say the plan.

800
00:40:21.689 --> 00:40:23.391
- Okay. sorry. So typic--
- So. typically here--

801
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.792
Anna. You're Anna?

802
00:40:25.326 --> 00:40:26.761
- No.
- Okay.

803
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:28.162
So typically when you get here.

804
00:40:28.262 --> 00:40:30.497
you get to pick eternity. and
that's it. Bing. bang. boom.

805
00:40:30.598 --> 00:40:35.569
However. in this unique circumstance.
you've gotten approved for a special visa.

806
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.872
Joan will be allowed two
visits to an eternity.

807
00:40:37.972 --> 00:40:39.941
- One with each of her former husbands.
-  Mm-hmm.

808
00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:42.510
- And then?
- And then she'll decide.

809
00:40:43.544 --> 00:40:44.679
Between the two of you.

810
00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:46.847
It seems like kind of a
high-pressure scenario.

811
00:40:46.948 --> 00:40:49.250
Okay. Well. you could all
choose the same eternity

812
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.483
and then work it out from there.

813
00:40:50.584 --> 00:40:52.520
But then you'd be in the
same place together forever.

814
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.821
Oh. that could work.

815
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:55.122
- No. no.
- I'm done...

816
00:40:55.222 --> 00:40:56.857
I'm done with this guy
creeping in the shadows.

817
00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:58.592
- Creeping in the shadows?
- Lurking.

818
00:40:58.693 --> 00:41:00.394
- Lurking?
- Yeah. You're a lurker. pal.

819
00:41:00.493 --> 00:41:03.164
And you're waiting beyond to
spoil a half a century of marriage.

820
00:41:03.264 --> 00:41:04.999
Well. I'm sorry I died
defending our country.

821
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:07.335
- It was Korea. buddy. Relax.
- What'd you say to me?

822
00:41:07.435 --> 00:41:09.804
You didn't exactly storm the
beaches of Normandy. did you?

823
00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:13.274
- What... What are you doing?
- You went there.

824
00:41:13.374 --> 00:41:14.709
Hey. Hey! Stop!

825
00:41:14.809 --> 00:41:15.876
- Hit him back. Larry.
- Stop!

826
00:41:15.977 --> 00:41:17.645
- I will bare-knuckle you.
- Yes. Luke!

827
00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:19.013
Stop it! Okay?

828
00:41:19.113 --> 00:41:20.848
This is what we're doing!

829
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:23.718
So. just...

830
00:41:25.586 --> 00:41:27.888
flip a coin and decide
who's going first.

831
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:29.023
No.

832
00:41:29.123 --> 00:41:31.993
I will not stand for
another man dating my wife.

833
00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:34.195
Maybe you should've
thought about that before

834
00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:35.730
you married another man's wife.

835
00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.797
Boys!

836
00:41:37.732 --> 00:41:39.066
Who's going first?

837
00:41:41.535 --> 00:41:43.070
I have a coin.

838
00:41:50.144 --> 00:41:51.312
Oh. shit.

839
00:41:51.412 --> 00:41:53.714
- Is that a pretzel?
- No.

840
00:41:53.814 --> 00:41:55.383
- Oh. my God.
- You still eating pretzels.

841
00:41:55.483 --> 00:41:57.218
- Yeah. Relax.
- Get on with it.

842
00:41:58.352 --> 00:41:59.286
Heads or tails?

843
00:41:59.987 --> 00:42:01.155
Heads.

844
00:42:01.922 --> 00:42:05.292
<i>The next stop
is Mountain World 312.</i>

845
00:42:05.393 --> 00:42:06.560
Oh.

846
00:42:10.698 --> 00:42:12.066
- What?
- I just...

847
00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:15.369
forgot how handsome you are.

848
00:42:15.736 --> 00:42:18.072
We were an attractive couple.

849
00:42:18.172 --> 00:42:20.509
Oh. come on. Everybody...

850
00:42:20.941 --> 00:42:24.678
Everybody assumed that you got
me pregnant and had to marry me.

851
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:27.148
Yeah. no. My mother. she
was... she was so upset

852
00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:29.817
when I told her that I wasn't.
because she...

853
00:42:29.917 --> 00:42:32.753
Well. she wanted hot grandkids so badly.

854
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.188
Not that my kids are ugly.

855
00:42:34.288 --> 00:42:35.956
I'm sure that they are hot.

856
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:38.893
Not that I care.

857
00:42:38.993 --> 00:42:39.860
I didn't assume.

858
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.396
Yeah. 'Cause I'm not...
I'm not into hot kids.

859
00:42:42.496 --> 00:42:44.331
No. I'm not into hot kids either.

860
00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:47.701
Yeah.

861
00:42:50.704 --> 00:42:52.073
I'm not into kids.

862
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.308
Good.

863
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:56.043
That's good.

864
00:43:17.064 --> 00:43:19.200
I remember the sky being bluer.

865
00:43:20.101 --> 00:43:21.068
Oh.

866
00:43:21.735 --> 00:43:23.104
Was it always that shade?

867
00:43:23.505 --> 00:43:24.738
Oh. yeah. Pretty much.

868
00:43:26.474 --> 00:43:27.908
Is that cloud moving?

869
00:43:30.244 --> 00:43:31.212
Yep.

870
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.248
They move.

871
00:43:44.526 --> 00:43:46.060
Is it how you imagined it?

872
00:43:46.627 --> 00:43:47.862
It's perfect.

873
00:43:53.234 --> 00:43:54.969
Oh. boy. Oh. Okay.

874
00:43:56.036 --> 00:43:57.271
Okay.

875
00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:01.275
Can't die twice.

876
00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:03.110
You can't die twice.

877
00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.178
Okay.

878
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:13.687
This okay?

879
00:44:15.422 --> 00:44:16.525
Mm-hmm.

880
00:44:16.891 --> 00:44:18.159
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

881
00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:23.097
No. we didn't know where
to put any of the trash.

882
00:44:23.197 --> 00:44:26.601
And so we didn't know they had a
place where bears didn't get to.

883
00:44:27.034 --> 00:44:29.303
It's cold. Was it always this cold?

884
00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:32.907
It's cold.

885
00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:37.311
Let's get you somewhere
nice and warm. huh?

886
00:44:38.045 --> 00:44:39.514
Mmm.

887
00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:41.916
I don't like how Luke's been going
around telling people he died in the war.

888
00:44:42.016 --> 00:44:43.717
Larry. the man died in the war.

889
00:44:43.817 --> 00:44:47.589
No. I know. but it's the way he says it.
"The war." like it's one of the cool ones.

890
00:44:47.688 --> 00:44:51.091
Okay. I think we should stop
squabbling about his obvious heroism.

891
00:44:51.192 --> 00:44:53.494
because I don't think that's
our strongest point of attack.

892
00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:57.932
The problem is Luke's
always been a memory.

893
00:44:58.032 --> 00:45:00.201
Now. I don't know how
you compete with a memory.

894
00:45:00.734 --> 00:45:03.237
All we are. are a
collection of memories.

895
00:45:03.337 --> 00:45:05.339
That's depressing. I don't like that.

896
00:45:05.439 --> 00:45:07.808
But the point is. you're
going to have to remind her

897
00:45:07.908 --> 00:45:10.010
of why she fell in love
with you in the first place.

898
00:45:11.412 --> 00:45:12.379
Honestly...

899
00:45:14.081 --> 00:45:16.450
I don't know why she
fell in love with me.

900
00:45:16.551 --> 00:45:17.751
Mmm.

901
00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:22.089
Well. you're gonna have to
figure that out. And fast.

902
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:28.663
There's someone here I gotta find.

903
00:45:28.762 --> 00:45:31.832
Okay. Now we're cooking.
Now we're cooking.

904
00:45:34.868 --> 00:45:37.404
My great-granddaughter
Charlotte would love this place.

905
00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:39.340
She's a little adventurer.

906
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.076
I guess so was her
mother. for that matter.

907
00:45:44.646 --> 00:45:46.514
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

908
00:45:48.015 --> 00:45:49.984
I'm sure she misses you.

909
00:45:50.719 --> 00:45:52.920
So is that okay? You
know. talking about...

910
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.190
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

911
00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.092
- You're not angry with me?
- For what?

912
00:45:58.192 --> 00:46:00.794
It's just... Sixty-seven
years. you know?

913
00:46:00.894 --> 00:46:05.833
I remarried after two years.
and you waited 67 years.

914
00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:07.868
Sixty-seven years. Wow.

915
00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:11.438
Mmm.

916
00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:15.175
Yeah.

917
00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:28.222
When eternity's on the line. one
lifetime of waiting seems like nothing.

918
00:46:30.057 --> 00:46:32.126
Jesus. you are so perfect.

919
00:46:32.226 --> 00:46:33.093
I'm not perfect.

920
00:46:33.193 --> 00:46:35.162
Oh. that's what perfect
people say.

921
00:46:35.262 --> 00:46:37.197
Fine. I hate hearing about your kids

922
00:46:37.298 --> 00:46:39.166
and your grandkids and
the kids they had. okay?

923
00:46:39.266 --> 00:46:41.468
I mean. I don't-I don't hate them.

924
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:42.537
Okay.

925
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:47.575
But it kills me that I didn't
get to have all that with you.

926
00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:54.081
I'm glad you had it.

927
00:46:56.618 --> 00:46:58.319
I'm glad you had a happy life.

928
00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:08.095
I would go to the docks
waiting for you to return.

929
00:47:08.495 --> 00:47:11.098
Watching all the soldiers
stream onto shore.

930
00:47:11.198 --> 00:47:13.200
'cause I convinced myself
that they got it wrong.

931
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.302
- That you would be among them. And...
- Joan.

932
00:47:18.172 --> 00:47:23.110
I would just sit and watch and wait.

933
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:28.449
So I...

934
00:47:30.951 --> 00:47:32.853
I did wait for you. Luke.

935
00:47:36.223 --> 00:47:37.257
Yeah.

936
00:47:37.358 --> 00:47:38.325
Yeah.

937
00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:44.532
Hmm.

938
00:47:44.632 --> 00:47:45.600
Hey.

939
00:47:47.736 --> 00:47:48.902
Come with me.

940
00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:10.257
If I wasn't already dead. I'd be
worried you're about to kill me.

941
00:48:13.862 --> 00:48:16.531
- Do you trust me?
- Oh. Sure.

942
00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:18.566
Come on.

943
00:48:22.804 --> 00:48:25.406
Hello. Mr. Fenwick.

944
00:48:25.507 --> 00:48:26.674
Just Fenwick.

945
00:48:28.108 --> 00:48:30.411
Right. Uh. we haven't
been here before--

946
00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:32.413
Individual or shared?

947
00:48:34.415 --> 00:48:36.785
- Shared.
- Do not touch the exhibits.

948
00:48:36.885 --> 00:48:38.553
Remember. the exhibits aren't real.

949
00:48:38.653 --> 00:48:41.922
We take no responsibility
for emotional trauma.

950
00:48:42.022 --> 00:48:43.157
Happy reliving.

951
00:48:44.458 --> 00:48:45.426
You ready?

952
00:48:45.527 --> 00:48:46.493
For what?

953
00:49:00.107 --> 00:49:01.709
Every eternity has one.

954
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.678
We call it archive tunnels.

955
00:49:03.778 --> 00:49:05.245
Which means?

956
00:49:05.345 --> 00:49:08.048
I don't know. I've never
been to an eternity before.

957
00:49:11.118 --> 00:49:12.620
We can find out together.

958
00:49:23.163 --> 00:49:24.998
- Hi. What's your name?
- Oh.

959
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.702
- Yeah. you.
-  Oh. I-I'm Joan.

960
00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:29.804
Yeah.

961
00:49:29.904 --> 00:49:31.238
What's your name?

962
00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:33.708
- Luke.
- Nice to meet you. Luke.

963
00:49:34.943 --> 00:49:36.477
- Oh. Luke.
- Joan's a pretty name.

964
00:49:36.578 --> 00:49:37.846
I haven't seen you around here before.

965
00:49:37.946 --> 00:49:40.915
Oh...
...well. I just moved to the city.

966
00:49:41.014 --> 00:49:42.884
Just around the corner. Briar...

967
00:49:42.983 --> 00:49:43.918
Briar cliff?

968
00:49:44.017 --> 00:49:45.185
Come on.

969
00:49:54.629 --> 00:49:57.297
- I was so nervous. Look at me.
- That's not what I'm saying--

970
00:49:57.832 --> 00:49:59.366
Look at you.

971
00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:01.636
Oh.

972
00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:10.512
Joan. I love you so much.

973
00:50:22.022 --> 00:50:23.156
Come on.

974
00:50:29.196 --> 00:50:30.965
Oh. nope. No. no.

975
00:50:31.064 --> 00:50:32.299
No. Luke. come on.

976
00:50:32.399 --> 00:50:35.537
- Oh. we're really going for it. eh?
- Hey.

977
00:50:35.637 --> 00:50:38.405
Stop!

978
00:50:57.124 --> 00:50:58.660
I don't wanna see this one.

979
00:51:03.631 --> 00:51:04.666
I love you.

980
00:51:04.766 --> 00:51:05.767
I love you.

981
00:51:15.475 --> 00:51:17.745
Worst day of my life.

982
00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:30.625
Luke.

983
00:51:30.725 --> 00:51:32.660
I missed you so much.

984
00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:35.495
Yeah.

985
00:52:01.956 --> 00:52:03.323
We should go.

986
00:52:04.224 --> 00:52:05.593
Luke. please.

987
00:52:05.693 --> 00:52:07.327
I don't remember this.

988
00:52:07.427 --> 00:52:10.798
- You don't need to see this.
- What's he doing at our dock?

989
00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:12.700
Can we just go please?

990
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.134
Please...

991
00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:15.837
Oh. God. Luke. Please.

992
00:52:20.407 --> 00:52:22.175
Will you marry me?

993
00:52:22.275 --> 00:52:24.879
Of course.

994
00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:28.016
He made her death about him.
It's selfish. is what it is.

995
00:52:28.116 --> 00:52:32.152
- If you say so. So who's Karen?
- Oh. God. She's a neighbor.

996
00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.389
Longest-serving member
of the Oakdale Avenue HOA.

997
00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:37.659
and she won't let you forget it.

998
00:52:38.126 --> 00:52:40.160
She would always leave these
little sticky notes on my door.

999
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.064
- She was a very passive-aggressive woman.
-  Okay. Here we are. Here we are.

1000
00:52:43.163 --> 00:52:44.799
- Gimme some space.
- Sorry.

1001
00:52:49.269 --> 00:52:52.774
Larry. I heard
about the pretzels.

1002
00:52:52.874 --> 00:52:54.142
Karen. You're still old.

1003
00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:56.844
I'm 72 now. thank you very much.

1004
00:52:57.612 --> 00:52:58.513
Yeah. no.

1005
00:52:58.613 --> 00:53:01.616
Sorry. it's just a weird
age to be your happiest.

1006
00:53:01.716 --> 00:53:04.284
- You remember when Jim died?
- That was your happiest?

1007
00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:06.353
- When your husband died?
- Oh. Jim was a dear.

1008
00:53:06.453 --> 00:53:10.357
But anyway. that summer when I went on
that pottery retreat with my friend Barb...

1009
00:53:11.092 --> 00:53:12.225
Right.

1010
00:53:12.325 --> 00:53:13.528
Well. Barb and I were lovers.

1011
00:53:13.628 --> 00:53:15.663
Oh. I-I didn't--

1012
00:53:15.763 --> 00:53:19.767
I went full lesbian for three
months. and it was fabulous.

1013
00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:24.072
But then I came back and I
had the kids. and the grandkids

1014
00:53:24.172 --> 00:53:28.509
and the church group. and I just went
back into that miserable old closet.

1015
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:30.377
Oh. that explains why
you were so mean to me.

1016
00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:32.046
Oh. no. I just didn't like you.

1017
00:53:32.146 --> 00:53:33.246
Right.

1018
00:53:33.346 --> 00:53:35.282
I came around eventually.

1019
00:53:35.382 --> 00:53:38.786
- You grow on people. Larry.
-  Mm-hmm.

1020
00:53:38.886 --> 00:53:39.921
I'm thinking...

1021
00:53:41.923 --> 00:53:43.323
Paris Land.

1022
00:53:43.423 --> 00:53:47.061
It's basically Paris in the '60s.
but they speak English with an accent.

1023
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.896
And they have civil rights.

1024
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:50.898
I take it you're waiting on Joan.

1025
00:53:50.998 --> 00:53:52.432
No. she's already here.

1026
00:53:52.533 --> 00:53:54.902
Ooh. shit week for Oakdale.

1027
00:53:55.435 --> 00:53:58.072
- So where you guys going?
- It's complicated.

1028
00:53:58.172 --> 00:54:00.074
- Oh. are you gay too?
- Mmm.

1029
00:54:00.174 --> 00:54:03.310
- Honestly. that would be easier.
- Look at you.

1030
00:54:04.912 --> 00:54:07.447
You seem so uncomfortable.

1031
00:54:07.548 --> 00:54:09.083
- Mm-hmm.
- Nah.

1032
00:54:09.183 --> 00:54:10.383
- I-I'm hot.
- Think about it.

1033
00:54:10.484 --> 00:54:12.452
The worst thing in the world
has already happened to you.

1034
00:54:12.553 --> 00:54:14.287
He wishes.

1035
00:54:14.387 --> 00:54:16.891
- Do tell.
- So. girl. this is what happened.

1036
00:54:16.991 --> 00:54:19.227
Okay. L-Listen. I came
here to ask a question.

1037
00:54:19.326 --> 00:54:20.862
and goddamn it. I'm gonna
ask Karen a question.

1038
00:54:20.962 --> 00:54:22.496
Then ask the question.

1039
00:54:23.164 --> 00:54:27.769
Karen. did Joan ever mention. um...

1040
00:54:28.836 --> 00:54:30.671
Why do you think she
fell in love with me?

1041
00:54:34.909 --> 00:54:37.211
- Uh...
- Karen. say something.

1042
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:40.480
- Anything. Just say something.
- Well. I...

1043
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:43.184
- Um...
- Anything.

1044
00:54:43.283 --> 00:54:45.887
I
don't know. She just did.

1045
00:54:45.987 --> 00:54:48.222
I mean. I-I never thought

1046
00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:50.658
she'd be happy again after Luke died...

1047
00:54:50.758 --> 00:54:52.459
...but you made her happy.

1048
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.528
Mmm.

1049
00:54:53.628 --> 00:54:56.264
You made your life
about making her happy.

1050
00:54:56.363 --> 00:54:59.033
- Isn't that enough?
- Eh.

1051
00:54:59.133 --> 00:55:00.500
Luke is here.

1052
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:02.369
- Joan's Luke?
-  Mm-hmm.

1053
00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:05.673
Oh. he was so dreamy.

1054
00:55:05.773 --> 00:55:07.775
I used to pretend I fancied him.

1055
00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:10.443
- Of course. I didn't.
- Because you're a big. secret lesbian?

1056
00:55:10.545 --> 00:55:11.779
- Exactly.
- Mmm.

1057
00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:12.847
But. wow.

1058
00:55:13.781 --> 00:55:14.749
He was perfect.

1059
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:16.449
Hey. listen to me.

1060
00:55:16.551 --> 00:55:17.819
No one is perfect.

1061
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:19.687
No one is perfect!

1062
00:55:19.787 --> 00:55:22.489
- Larry. don't be like that!
- No one is perfect!

1063
00:55:22.924 --> 00:55:25.927
- Luke. Luke. would you calm down?
- About what?

1064
00:55:26.426 --> 00:55:28.663
You know. if you just...

1065
00:55:28.763 --> 00:55:31.999
If you think about it.
it was his way of saying

1066
00:55:32.099 --> 00:55:34.302
that-that he knew that you
would always be a part of me.

1067
00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:36.671
Come on. Joan. He wormed his way in.

1068
00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:38.706
He manipulated you by using your grief.

1069
00:55:38.806 --> 00:55:40.007
- No.
- He is such a leech.

1070
00:55:40.107 --> 00:55:41.943
That is not what happened. okay?

1071
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:43.711
You left.

1072
00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.014
I didn't leave. I died.

1073
00:55:53.588 --> 00:55:56.090
Would you have said yes if
you weren't still grieving?

1074
00:55:57.058 --> 00:55:59.126
I never stopped grieving.

1075
00:56:01.863 --> 00:56:03.130
Would you say yes?

1076
00:56:17.377 --> 00:56:19.013
Larry. Larry! Listen.

1077
00:56:19.113 --> 00:56:21.682
I am rooting for you. but
this is not the way. okay?

1078
00:56:21.782 --> 00:56:24.051
It's not even about him.
This is about you and Joan.

1079
00:56:24.151 --> 00:56:27.154
The woman who you have
loved for 65 beautiful years.

1080
00:56:27.255 --> 00:56:28.990
and have made her very happy.

1081
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.792
This is about showing that
same woman that you're willing

1082
00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:34.929
to spend all of eternity
together to do the same thing.

1083
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:37.698
Now. is this gonna make her happy?

1084
00:56:39.533 --> 00:56:40.635
- Okay. cool.
- What kind of creep

1085
00:56:40.735 --> 00:56:41.636
leaves their door unlocked?

1086
00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:43.371
- Maybe he doesn't
have anything to hide.

1087
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.139
- Nah. everybody's
got something to hide.

1088
00:56:47.174 --> 00:56:48.542
That's a little dramatic.

1089
00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:51.078
It's actually really hard to keep
track of time here. so I applaud him.

1090
00:56:51.178 --> 00:56:53.014
It's very practical.

1091
00:56:53.114 --> 00:56:54.916
Larry. come on.

1092
00:56:56.517 --> 00:56:58.586
Ha! Does a perfect person look at this?

1093
00:56:58.686 --> 00:57:00.621
You've never looked
at porn before. Larry?

1094
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:05.425
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah. What about this?

1095
00:57:05.526 --> 00:57:06.961
Look at all these numbers.

1096
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:09.297
- Yeah. it's numbers.
- That one's got lipstick.

1097
00:57:09.397 --> 00:57:10.765
- Mm-hmm.
-  That means they're kissing.

1098
00:57:10.865 --> 00:57:14.101
Yeah. it's been 67
years. What would you do?

1099
00:57:16.037 --> 00:57:19.307
Larry. come on. This is
enough. It's too much.

1100
00:57:19.407 --> 00:57:21.509
- Yeah. What am I doing?
- Let's go.

1101
00:57:21.609 --> 00:57:23.110
- Let's just go.
- What the...

1102
00:57:23.978 --> 00:57:25.445
You goddamn snake.

1103
00:57:25.546 --> 00:57:27.415
Well. clearly the date
didn't go too well. did it?

1104
00:57:27.515 --> 00:57:28.683
Oh. you took advantage of her.

1105
00:57:28.783 --> 00:57:30.217
What're you talking about?

1106
00:57:30.318 --> 00:57:32.820
You made your engagement about me.

1107
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.989
You used my death to worm your way in.

1108
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:37.425
- I don't have to listen to this.
- I felt awful leaving Joan alone.

1109
00:57:37.558 --> 00:57:39.226
I genuinely hoped she
would find someone.

1110
00:57:39.327 --> 00:57:40.628
Yeah. right.

1111
00:57:40.728 --> 00:57:43.064
But she woulda been better
off alone than with you.

1112
00:57:43.496 --> 00:57:45.166
Well. I tried.

1113
00:57:48.235 --> 00:57:49.837
Hey. is that hair dye?

1114
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:54.008
Stop!

1115
00:57:55.475 --> 00:57:56.644
My nose!

1116
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.581
Get off of me!

1117
00:58:00.681 --> 00:58:01.782
- Get off me!
- Get off me.

1118
00:58:01.882 --> 00:58:04.618
That's it? That's all y'all can do?

1119
00:58:07.722 --> 00:58:09.390
I didn't betray you. Luke.

1120
00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:11.292
I didn't even know you.

1121
00:58:11.392 --> 00:58:16.664
Yeah. Then why did you
propose at the dock?

1122
00:58:20.034 --> 00:58:21.168
Larry.

1123
00:58:21.268 --> 00:58:24.505
<i>Trauma specialists
to Junction 145.</i>

1124
00:58:24.605 --> 00:58:25.706
<i>Plane crash incoming.</i>

1125
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:26.941
Baby formula. Here.

1126
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:28.576
- Sir...
- We also do breast milk.

1127
00:58:29.977 --> 00:58:31.545
- Just a minute of your time. Please!
- Okay.

1128
00:58:31.645 --> 00:58:33.381
- L-Let's get you somewhere quiet.
- Oh. God.

1129
00:58:33.481 --> 00:58:35.816
- Bromance World.
- Why won't anybody come to Library World?

1130
00:58:42.056 --> 00:58:44.859
<i>Final
call for High School World.</i>

1131
00:58:47.762 --> 00:58:49.697
What's wrong with these eternities?

1132
00:58:50.564 --> 00:58:52.767
Oh. some are full.

1133
00:58:52.867 --> 00:58:56.370
- Others are just out of fashion.
- Hmm.

1134
00:58:56.470 --> 00:59:00.708
Quite a few of them weren't
very PC by today's standards.

1135
00:59:00.808 --> 00:59:01.976
If that makes any sense.

1136
00:59:02.076 --> 00:59:05.780
So. like. what happened to
the people inside of them?

1137
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.316
They are still in there
living out their afterlives.

1138
00:59:10.885 --> 00:59:11.886
Right.

1139
00:59:17.358 --> 00:59:18.759
Oh. God.

1140
00:59:19.593 --> 00:59:22.129
I don't know what to do.

1141
00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:28.135
You spent your entire life
worrying about other people.

1142
00:59:28.235 --> 00:59:31.172
Now it's time to decide
what's best for you.

1143
00:59:31.272 --> 00:59:32.206
Let me guess.

1144
00:59:33.707 --> 00:59:35.476
Luke is best for me?

1145
00:59:36.143 --> 00:59:39.713
I want you to choose Luke
because it's the life you missed.

1146
00:59:40.781 --> 00:59:43.117
Eternity is a long time to have regrets.

1147
00:59:44.652 --> 00:59:47.488
But that's your decision to make.

1148
00:59:47.855 --> 00:59:50.091
Oh. God.

1149
00:59:50.191 --> 00:59:53.627
What if I... What if I...
I don't know what to choose?

1150
00:59:53.727 --> 00:59:55.763
Well. you need to figure it out.

1151
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:57.932
Sorry.

1152
01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:08.209
Just have fun at the beach tomorrow.

1153
01:00:08.642 --> 01:00:10.845
It is a paradise after all.

1154
01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:19.687
I didn't think it would be this busy.

1155
01:00:21.188 --> 01:00:23.958
- Yeah. it's fine.
- Very popular. It's okay.

1156
01:00:24.058 --> 01:00:25.626
Wonder if we can get an umbrella.

1157
01:00:25.726 --> 01:00:29.029
Yeah. you'd think that they
would hand one to you. huh? Or a chair?

1158
01:00:34.536 --> 01:00:36.103
Look at the view.

1159
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:44.678
You were so beautiful. honey.

1160
01:00:44.778 --> 01:00:46.213
Oh.

1161
01:00:46.313 --> 01:00:48.550
I mean. you are beautiful.

1162
01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:51.352
And you've always been beautiful.

1163
01:00:51.452 --> 01:00:54.321
- you never stopped being beautiful.
- I get what you mean. love.

1164
01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:59.660
You are right though. This
would've been a nice vacation.

1165
01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:02.796
I mean. it doesn't have to be here.

1166
01:01:02.897 --> 01:01:05.099
If you want another eternity. we can...

1167
01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:07.602
We can go to space for all I care.

1168
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:09.737
As long as Luke's not floating around.

1169
01:01:18.145 --> 01:01:20.381
You look pretty good yourself.

1170
01:01:22.883 --> 01:01:24.351
Fore!

1171
01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:25.786
That's golf. idiot!

1172
01:01:25.886 --> 01:01:27.221
Okay. Larry. it's a child.

1173
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:28.657
Oh. he's-he's probably 90.

1174
01:01:28.756 --> 01:01:30.224
I actually died when I was nine.

1175
01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:32.527
- Oh.
- Oh.

1176
01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:34.328
- Right.
- Hit and run.

1177
01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:36.463
Least it was quick.

1178
01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:37.831
It was not quick.

1179
01:01:38.299 --> 01:01:42.169
It was very. very slow.

1180
01:01:42.269 --> 01:01:44.606
- Oh.
- Get. Get.

1181
01:01:45.105 --> 01:01:47.007
Hon. why don't we... why
don't we just get out of here.

1182
01:01:47.107 --> 01:01:48.108
Okay.

1183
01:01:53.881 --> 01:01:55.517
How was my funeral?

1184
01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:56.884
Decent turnout?

1185
01:01:56.984 --> 01:01:59.286
Yeah. you would've liked it.

1186
01:01:59.386 --> 01:02:00.622
Really?

1187
01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:02.957
Well. I mean. you would've pretended
to hate it. but it was nice.

1188
01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:07.529
Zach did the eulogy.

1189
01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:09.564
Did he try to be funny?

1190
01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:13.467
Yeah. he did. He did try to be
funny. But. you know. it was sweet.

1191
01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:16.403
The kids were-were so devastated.

1192
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:19.440
Who was the most devastated?

1193
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:24.178
I'm not answering that.

1194
01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:29.783
Sweetie. I'm sorry I
wasn't there when you...

1195
01:02:31.285 --> 01:02:32.486
You know.

1196
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.023
Yeah. but you were waiting
for me when I arrived.

1197
01:02:41.095 --> 01:02:43.497
The kids will be happy
that we're together.

1198
01:02:52.239 --> 01:02:53.307
Larry.

1199
01:02:53.407 --> 01:02:54.375
Mmm?

1200
01:02:56.143 --> 01:03:00.014
You have to understand that
I'm in an impossible situation.

1201
01:03:02.684 --> 01:03:05.219
No. I don't understand.

1202
01:03:06.153 --> 01:03:07.955
I understand you loved Luke.

1203
01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.990
I loved Sally Daniels
in the ninth grade.

1204
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:12.560
He wasn't some childhood
crush. Larry. He was my husband.

1205
01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:15.630
Yeah. but we built a life together. and
now you just wanna throw it all away.

1206
01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:18.999
Well. I never had a chance to
start a life with Luke. and...

1207
01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.935
- you know. God. he waited 67--
- Sixty-seven years.

1208
01:03:22.036 --> 01:03:23.937
Yeah. I get it. I would've
done the same thing.

1209
01:03:24.038 --> 01:03:26.040
Well. you knew I was close.

1210
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.842
I was ready to wait
for as long as it took.

1211
01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:32.413
I was.

1212
01:03:32.514 --> 01:03:35.517
It's getting late. We should
head back. okay. honey?

1213
01:03:40.954 --> 01:03:42.323
You're an idiot. Larry.

1214
01:03:42.423 --> 01:03:43.658
Okay. hold on.

1215
01:03:43.758 --> 01:03:45.225
I'm holding on.

1216
01:03:45.326 --> 01:03:47.428
- You gotta shift your weight.
- Okay. okay.

1217
01:03:47.529 --> 01:03:50.164
- Just don't hurt yourself. please.
- I know. but you're gonna tip us.

But you take a wrong turn
in one of those things.

1226
01:04:21.563 --> 01:04:23.330
you could be stuck in
your worst nightmare.

1227
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.333
Okay. what... Forget about it. I
just... I thought it could be fun.

1228
01:04:26.433 --> 01:04:28.235
I-I know. I'm just...
I'm-I'm trying to protect you.

1229
01:04:28.335 --> 01:04:30.971
No. you are protecting yourself.

1230
01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:33.307
What're you so afraid you'll see?

1231
01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:34.542
Hmm?

1232
01:04:34.642 --> 01:04:35.976
It doesn't matter. It's fine.

1233
01:04:36.076 --> 01:04:37.812
- You don't know what's going--
- Honey. it's okay.

1234
01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:39.380
Gonna happen in there.

1235
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.982
Wait. Joan... I...

1236
01:04:42.082 --> 01:04:43.484
Look. They look miserable.

1237
01:04:53.994 --> 01:04:56.163
Larry. do you remember our first date?

1238
01:04:57.297 --> 01:04:58.465
The flat.

1239
01:04:58.566 --> 01:05:01.135
When we pulled over. do
you remember what you said?

1240
01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:04.873
You said that. "This is the
perfect place for a flat tire.

1241
01:05:05.272 --> 01:05:08.375
Wide shoulder. beautiful
day. quiet road."

1242
01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:11.746
Till I realized I didn't have a spare.

1243
01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:14.381
Yeah. well. you never let me know it.

1244
01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:18.820
You seemed so broken back then. honey.

1245
01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:21.856
I-I felt like I needed
to be strong for you.

1246
01:05:22.389 --> 01:05:24.425
I just wanted to make everything okay.

1247
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.862
Right down to that flat tire.

1248
01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:30.097
And you did make everything okay.

1249
01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:33.535
We had a wonderful life together.

1250
01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:43.277
Come here.

1251
01:06:04.965 --> 01:06:06.768
I don't care where we end up.

1252
01:06:06.868 --> 01:06:08.736
Just as long as we're together.

1253
01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:19.346
Okay.

1254
01:06:19.446 --> 01:06:21.749
- So. uh. what-what's what's going on?
-  What is...

1255
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.050
Yeah. what're
you guys--

1256
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:24.652
I think it's important you
hear what Luke has to say.

1257
01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:25.954
I'm so sorry. Larry.

1258
01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:28.556
You should be. 'cause after
Larry broke into my apartment. I--

1259
01:06:28.656 --> 01:06:30.991
- After he what?
- No. the door was open.

1260
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:32.292
- Was it?
- Jesus. Larry.

1261
01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:34.562
- Not a big deal.
- What is your... Sorry. what is that?

1262
01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:36.698
- Do the honors.
- Okay. Look. that I can ex...

1263
01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:39.066
- I can explain. It's okay.
- It sounds way worse than it is.

1264
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.802
- "Dear Jo. I..." No.
- No. Give it to me.

1265
01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:42.002
We don't need to do this right now.

1266
01:06:42.102 --> 01:06:43.738
- Honey... Just give me...
- Joanie. I just wanted you to know

1267
01:06:43.838 --> 01:06:45.940
- the truth about this man.
- Hey. I can... Let me talk--

1268
01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:47.775
Oh. go grovel.

1269
01:06:47.876 --> 01:06:51.846
Just... Okay. I know. but
it-it-it's out of context. honey.

1270
01:06:51.946 --> 01:06:53.013
Yes. it is.

1271
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.782
I'm sorry. you said that...

1272
01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:57.585
that you were willing to
wait as long as it took.

1273
01:06:57.685 --> 01:06:59.621
but you-you couldn't
even last a measly week?

1274
01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:00.922
I was. I honest... I...

1275
01:07:01.021 --> 01:07:02.724
Um. I was trying to set
up our eternity. and--

1276
01:07:02.824 --> 01:07:04.358
And you just assumed that
I would come find you?

1277
01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:06.059
Well. yeah. because you're my wife.

1278
01:07:06.159 --> 01:07:10.030
I'm sorry. you were... you were really
willing to trick me into an eternity?

1279
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.332
No. swe... I wasn't trying to
trick you. okay? I honestly...

1280
01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:14.268
I swear to God. I thought
I was doing the right thing.

1281
01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:17.672
God. And to think I was
killing myself over this.

1282
01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:19.172
And you-you...

1283
01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:23.978
God. you-you are so selfish!

1284
01:07:24.077 --> 01:07:25.178
- I'm being selfish?
- Yeah.

1285
01:07:25.279 --> 01:07:27.180
You are being selfish.
because you're here

1286
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:29.349
trying to decide between
a man buffet of...

1287
01:07:29.884 --> 01:07:30.919
men.

1288
01:07:31.019 --> 01:07:32.286
And I guarantee

1289
01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:34.121
you've already slept with
Mr. Perfect over here.

1290
01:07:34.221 --> 01:07:36.024
- I'm not perfect.
- As a matter of fact. I haven't.

1291
01:07:36.123 --> 01:07:37.224
But you know what?

1292
01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:39.192
Yeah. I've thought about it.

1293
01:07:39.293 --> 01:07:42.964
I mean. who wouldn't want that
kind of fiery. sparky love?

1294
01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:44.532
- Hell yeah.
- No.

1295
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.869
I guess everyone's been right then.

1296
01:07:47.969 --> 01:07:49.136
About what. Larry?

1297
01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:51.739
That you never loved me
the way that you loved him.

1298
01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:55.208
That I was just a consolation prize.

1299
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.418
Well. I. uh...

1300
01:08:05.753 --> 01:08:08.823
I know
he would never lie to me.

1301
01:08:08.923 --> 01:08:09.924
- Oh. really?
- Yeah.

1302
01:08:10.024 --> 01:08:11.593
Do you know that he dyes his hair?

1303
01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:14.094
And do you know that he's got a-a
worryingly large porn collection?

1304
01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:15.262
Oh. Jesus Christ. Larry.

1305
01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:17.197
I know about the
<i>Playboy</i> s in the garage.

1306
01:08:17.297 --> 01:08:18.733
Coasters. coasters. Tell
her about the coasters.

1307
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.100
Yes. and the coasters.

1308
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.537
He's got a. uh. a basket of
coasters with ladies' numbers on 'em.

1309
01:08:22.637 --> 01:08:24.005
Okay... What is he talking about?

1310
01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:25.907
What is he talking about? He's
talking about breaking and entering.

1311
01:08:26.007 --> 01:08:28.009
No. see. He's being... He's very...

1312
01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:29.510
- He's slippery.
- Oh. yeah?

1313
01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:31.445
He's a snake and he's
being purposefully vague.

1314
01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:33.246
Yeah. like how he was with "the war."

1315
01:08:33.347 --> 01:08:34.816
Ignore them. Luke. You're perfect.

1316
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:42.189
- He's unhinged.
- You okay. babe?

1317
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:45.693
I'm not perfect. okay?
Yes. I dye my hair.

1318
01:08:45.793 --> 01:08:48.997
And yes. I slept with a few
women over the last 60 years.

1319
01:08:49.097 --> 01:08:50.665
Oh. okay. I mean. that's understandable.

1320
01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:53.034
And one guy. One guy.

1321
01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:54.501
- Don't lie.
- Two.

1322
01:08:54.602 --> 01:08:55.937
Two guys. Just to see. Both times.

1323
01:08:56.037 --> 01:08:59.272
And I went through that BDSM
phase about 30 years ago--

1324
01:08:59.373 --> 01:09:00.908
Yes. you did. I remember
it like it was yesterday.

1325
01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:02.275
Yeah. me too.

1326
01:09:02.376 --> 01:09:03.443
Was fun. but n-not for me.

1327
01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:06.047
I didn't expect you to be
a-a priest for so long--

1328
01:09:06.146 --> 01:09:08.850
And I think I was beginning to bald
when I died. I-I-I comb it over.

1329
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.151
Whatever. You keep saying I'm
perfect. you keep saying I'm perfect.

1330
01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:13.955
everyone keeps saying I'm perfect.
I am not perfect. Nobody is perfect.

1331
01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:15.523
Finally. Thank you.

1332
01:09:15.623 --> 01:09:16.591
But I did wait.

1333
01:09:17.257 --> 01:09:19.259
I waited for you. Joanie.

1334
01:09:22.362 --> 01:09:24.164
He should at least lose
some points for all the sex.

1335
01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:26.034
God. this is not a competition. Larry.

1336
01:09:26.134 --> 01:09:27.635
- Yes. it is!
- Sweetheart.

1337
01:09:27.735 --> 01:09:29.704
- It is 100%. for sure a competition.
- It is in fact a competition.

1338
01:09:29.804 --> 01:09:32.807
- That's literally what we're here for.
- Look. Joan.

1339
01:09:33.574 --> 01:09:36.978
I'm done with the games. You need
to decide if it's me or if it's him.

1340
01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:38.813
Yeah. you need to make a decision.

1341
01:09:39.312 --> 01:09:40.848
- Who's it gonna be?
- Which one?

1342
01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:43.316
It's gotta be one
of us. You gotta pick.

1343
01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.820
I-I think we need to give
my client some time to think.

1344
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.488
Let's just go for a walk.
Let her breathe a little.

1345
01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:54.327
Let's get you
boys something to drink.

1346
01:09:54.428 --> 01:09:56.196
A drink sounds nice. right?

1347
01:09:56.564 --> 01:09:57.665
Something stiff.

1348
01:10:28.495 --> 01:10:29.664
God.

1349
01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:34.869
Yeah?

1350
01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.270
I heard you kicked it too.

1351
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:42.844
Sweetie...

1352
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:46.346
Oh...

1353
01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:53.286
Well. I guess there's nothing
more we can do. It's up to her.

1354
01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:06.299
Can I have one of them?

1355
01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:11.404
Just relax and get your
mind off those boys.

1356
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.541
We deserve this.

1357
01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:15.710
You know what's funny
about you being here

1358
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.411
is that you actually knew me
when I was with both of them.

1359
01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:19.914
Oh. for Christ's sake. Joan.

1360
01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.281
- Drink.
- Oh. sure.

1361
01:11:21.381 --> 01:11:23.050
Just... Mmm.

1362
01:11:23.151 --> 01:11:27.121
- I got a toast. This one is for Korea.
- Yeah. you're damn right.

1363
01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:29.123
Not enough films made about it.

1364
01:11:29.724 --> 01:11:31.626
Well. except <i>M*A#S*H</i> .

1365
01:11:32.794 --> 01:11:34.896
What the hell's <i>M*A#S*H</i> ?

1366
01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:36.931
Ah. man. You gotta
watch <i>M*A#S*H</i> .

1367
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:39.667
Then I choose Luke.

1368
01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.702
- Okay.
- No.

1369
01:11:42.637 --> 01:11:43.604
Larry.

1370
01:11:45.706 --> 01:11:46.908
Larry. Okay.

1371
01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:48.810
God. shitty shit!

1372
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.077
I'm so sorry.

1373
01:11:53.781 --> 01:11:55.883
- I don't think you're going bald.
- What're you talking about?

1374
01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:56.851
No. It can...

1375
01:11:56.951 --> 01:11:59.486
You can easily pass that
off as a double crown.

1376
01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:00.788
You know what? I appreciate that.

1377
01:12:00.888 --> 01:12:02.557
A-And you're pretty handsome yourself.

1378
01:12:02.657 --> 01:12:04.091
You don't... You don't have to say that.

1379
01:12:04.192 --> 01:12:06.794
You're a catch. Y-Y-You
got that mysterious thing.

1380
01:12:06.894 --> 01:12:10.198
Like. "I'm thinking deep stuff."
And women. they're into that.

1381
01:12:10.298 --> 01:12:13.234
Really? 'Cause I'm
not. I mean. honestly.

1382
01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:16.003
I've been dead. and I haven't once
thought about the meaning of life.

1383
01:12:16.103 --> 01:12:18.506
They're like. "This is it." and I'm
like. "Yeah. that makes sense to me."

1384
01:12:18.606 --> 01:12:20.141
You're smart. Don't overthink it.

1385
01:12:20.241 --> 01:12:23.144
You know who you are. you know what
you want. and you go and get it.

1386
01:12:23.244 --> 01:12:25.445
You start thinking about all
the infinite possibilities.

1387
01:12:25.546 --> 01:12:27.748
and guess what? You never move.

1388
01:12:27.849 --> 01:12:29.951
- She doesn't deserve you.
- And she doesn't deserve you.

1389
01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:33.120
You are smart. you are
handsome. and you're a war hero.

1390
01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:34.589
And you gave her kids.

1391
01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:37.024
- I did.
- I bet you looked after 'em well.

1392
01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:39.227
- Yeah. I did.
- <i>Salud.</i>

1393
01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:43.130
And at first. it was about Luke and me.

1394
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:45.967
And then there were
decisions about Larry and me.

1395
01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:49.402
- And. you know. it was about the kids.
- Are you considering this eternity?

1396
01:12:49.502 --> 01:12:52.740
And. you know. work.
But this one is about me.

1397
01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:54.374
And...

1398
01:12:55.776 --> 01:12:58.646
You are dead.

1399
01:12:58.746 --> 01:13:01.249
- Jesus. Karen.
- You lived your life.

1400
01:13:01.349 --> 01:13:02.583
and now you're dead.

1401
01:13:02.683 --> 01:13:05.853
You have no obligations to anyone.

1402
01:13:05.953 --> 01:13:08.522
Maybe it's best you
all have a clean slate.

1403
01:13:08.623 --> 01:13:12.026
Uh. i-it's just we have
others interested. and I feel--

1404
01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:14.427
A little less of this.
a little more of this.

1405
01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.396
Thank you. honey.

1406
01:13:16.496 --> 01:13:18.699
- Thank you.
- You can go.

1407
01:13:18.799 --> 01:13:20.167
It's just...

1408
01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:23.204
- She's a...
- She's a perfect person.

1409
01:13:23.304 --> 01:13:25.039
She's a perfect person.

1410
01:13:31.946 --> 01:13:32.880
Come here.

1411
01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:50.665
Coming!

1412
01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:08.549
Do we have a little
headache this morning?

1413
01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.053
I've made my decision.

1414
01:14:12.153 --> 01:14:13.521
Okay.

1415
01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:16.489
I'll
gather your husbands.

1416
01:14:17.024 --> 01:14:18.225
I need a shower.

1417
01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:20.460
Yeah. You do.

1418
01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:23.664
I'm so nervous. Are you guys nervous?

1419
01:14:23.764 --> 01:14:25.366
You should definitely be
nervous. You too. Not to...

1420
01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:27.368
Not to mean that you should be
more nervous than anybody else.

1421
01:14:27.467 --> 01:14:29.203
but I'm just saying there's a
lot of nerves going all around.

1422
01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:31.172
- Hey. Why are you talking so fast?
- Are you nervous?

1423
01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:32.807
Oh. my gosh. 'Cause I'm nervous.

1424
01:14:32.907 --> 01:14:34.875
You guys should both be
shitting yourselves right now.

1425
01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:36.143
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

1426
01:14:45.553 --> 01:14:47.655
My client has reached her decision.

1427
01:14:53.728 --> 01:14:56.297
Love is a bond greater than death.

1428
01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:57.898
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

1429
01:14:57.999 --> 01:15:02.303
But some bonds are. well.
better bonded.

1430
01:15:02.403 --> 01:15:06.040
You have your ionic bonds.
you have your covalent bonds.

1431
01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.074
Your savings bonds.

1432
01:15:07.174 --> 01:15:09.577
- Bail bonds. You--
- Yeah. Okay. That's good.

1433
01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:11.278
- That's great. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1434
01:15:11.379 --> 01:15:12.613
Okay.

1435
01:15:16.884 --> 01:15:18.219
Okay.

1436
01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:21.088
So. Larry.

1437
01:15:21.522 --> 01:15:23.657
My first morning without you. I...

1438
01:15:24.859 --> 01:15:26.460
God. I hoped it was a bad dream.

1439
01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:29.397
I-I smelled your toast
burning downstairs.

1440
01:15:29.497 --> 01:15:30.598
I...

1441
01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:33.000
I heard the rattle of
the back door and...

1442
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.902
You know. I even...

1443
01:15:35.002 --> 01:15:37.838
I even threw your pillows
on the ground the way...

1444
01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:40.474
the way you always did and...

1445
01:15:40.975 --> 01:15:42.810
You know. I was pretending...

1446
01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:45.846
It's okay. honey.

1447
01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:49.483
And.
uh. the funny thing is...

1448
01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:51.585
is that I... I felt that before.

1449
01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:53.320
When. uh...

1450
01:15:53.421 --> 01:15:55.790
When Luke died.

1451
01:15:57.491 --> 01:16:02.163
We never had a chance to see
where our love would take us.

1452
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:07.902
But you gave me everything that
I needed in the time we had.

1453
01:16:09.904 --> 01:16:10.871
Yeah.

1454
01:16:12.973 --> 01:16:14.075
So...

1455
01:16:14.175 --> 01:16:15.643
God. how lucky am I...

1456
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:19.747
...to have
had you both. you know?

1457
01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:27.254
And. uh. maybe things worked
out the way they were meant to.

1458
01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:30.825
Hmm.

1459
01:16:30.925 --> 01:16:33.060
S-So. what are you... What
are you saying? I don't...

1460
01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:37.631
I'm saying. um...

1461
01:16:39.467 --> 01:16:40.668
that I choose...

1462
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:49.210
I
choose neither of you.

1463
01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:52.646
- You choose neither of us?
- You're kidding. right?

1464
01:16:52.746 --> 01:16:54.248
So. you're gonna hurt
three people instead of one?

1465
01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:57.218
No. there was never
going to... to be one.

1466
01:16:57.318 --> 01:16:58.352
Don't you get it?

1467
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.323
I was going to be crushed either way.

1468
01:17:02.423 --> 01:17:04.058
But we built a life together.

1469
01:17:04.158 --> 01:17:07.394
Well. yeah. Maybe the
beauty in life is that...

1470
01:17:08.329 --> 01:17:10.498
Is that things end.

1471
01:17:11.332 --> 01:17:14.902
- You know? Maybe that's what...
- ...this is all for.

1472
01:17:15.402 --> 01:17:16.737
So...

1473
01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:22.209
So. I choose neither of you.

1474
01:17:25.045 --> 01:17:26.914
Yeah. Okay.

1475
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:11.626
Why do we even bother?
I mean. do we help?

1476
01:18:12.259 --> 01:18:15.262
- Do we make a difference?
- Of course we make a difference.

1477
01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:16.764
We annoy them.

1478
01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:18.332
They've just died.

1479
01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:19.700
They're scared.

1480
01:18:20.267 --> 01:18:23.103
It's better to be
annoyed than to be scared.

1481
01:18:23.538 --> 01:18:24.705
Right?

1482
01:18:34.683 --> 01:18:36.183
You sure about this?

1483
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:38.452
Oh. yeah. I'm sure.

1484
01:18:39.554 --> 01:18:41.822
Well. let's go.

1485
01:18:47.428 --> 01:18:50.397
<i>You were right. by the
way. Even my proposal was about you.</i>

1486
01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:53.834
You were the ghost I
could never compete with.

1487
01:18:54.301 --> 01:18:55.269
No.

1488
01:18:56.303 --> 01:18:59.240
Do you have any idea
how jealous I am of you?

1489
01:19:00.642 --> 01:19:02.343
You got to have a life with her.

1490
01:19:05.112 --> 01:19:07.915
Hey. you know you were the
last thing I saw before I died?

1491
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:10.818
What do you mean?

1492
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:15.690
I was eating a pretzel
and my great-granddaughter--

1493
01:19:15.789 --> 01:19:16.924
- Charlotte?
- Yeah.

1494
01:19:18.292 --> 01:19:22.530
Shows me this old picture of
you and Joan on your wedding day.

1495
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.099
And then I started choking.

1496
01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:38.979
Yeah. I gotta admit. you
weren't who I was expecting.

1497
01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:40.781
You're exactly what I was expecting.

1498
01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:44.184
Minus the porn and hair dye.

1499
01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:49.823
About six months before I died. I was...

1500
01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:54.228
I was graying at the temples
and. you know. I just didn't care.

1501
01:19:56.063 --> 01:20:00.501
'Cause Joan and I. we'd just had this
conversation about starting a family.

1502
01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:06.307
Everything was laid out in front of us.

1503
01:20:08.108 --> 01:20:10.377
That was my happiest.

1504
01:20:15.182 --> 01:20:16.551
I'm 35.

1505
01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:23.057
Joan was pregnant with our second
and we went out to dinner one night.

1506
01:20:24.491 --> 01:20:27.161
The doctor was telling us
about all these new studies

1507
01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:29.597
where you're not supposed to
drink when you're pregnant.

1508
01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:34.001
And I got my glass of wine
and Joan took a sip of it.

1509
01:20:35.637 --> 01:20:38.807
and she just had this
little smile on her face.

1510
01:20:39.674 --> 01:20:46.447
And I don't know but. in that moment.
it just felt like we were a team.

1511
01:20:58.727 --> 01:20:59.794
You okay?

1512
01:20:59.927 --> 01:21:02.329
Oh. my God. I have to go.

1513
01:21:11.773 --> 01:21:12.940
What's going on?

1514
01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.375
Your AC will explain everything.

1515
01:21:14.475 --> 01:21:16.110
What's an AC?

1516
01:21:29.323 --> 01:21:32.794
We can go to this café on
the Seine where a fake Sartre

1517
01:21:32.893 --> 01:21:37.898
and fake Camus have a fight and they have
great <i>pain au chocolat</i> .

1518
01:21:38.265 --> 01:21:40.835
Was Camus the one who
always talked about death?

1519
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.237
'Cause that just kinda
sounds pointless now.

1520
01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:44.438
Really?

1521
01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:47.474
You know. I read <i>Sartre
For Beginners</i> .

1522
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.144
How do you say Sartre?

1523
01:21:50.244 --> 01:21:52.179
- Sar... Sartre.
- Sartre.

1524
01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:53.548
And--

1525
01:21:53.914 --> 01:21:55.182
What's Larry doing here?

1526
01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:56.250
I...

1527
01:22:06.994 --> 01:22:10.264
- Please. Larry. I made up my mind. okay?
- Yeah.

1528
01:22:10.364 --> 01:22:13.367
- You know this is best. Okay?
- Your hair is different.

1529
01:22:14.968 --> 01:22:17.337
- Okay. Thank you.
- No.

1530
01:22:17.438 --> 01:22:20.474
Y-You never had it like
that when we were together.

1531
01:22:20.575 --> 01:22:22.544
No. I-I cut it after...

1532
01:22:25.078 --> 01:22:26.548
It suits you.

1533
01:22:27.782 --> 01:22:28.949
Larry.

1534
01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:31.586
You should go with Luke.

1535
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.290
Okay? You deserve a shot
at that kind of love. honey.

1536
01:22:36.658 --> 01:22:40.093
That fiery. sparky kind.

1537
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:44.699
But I
was so. so happy with you.

1538
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.168
I... I know.

1539
01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:50.103
But you were happiest with him.

1540
01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:54.843
- It's okay.
- B-But what... What about you?

1541
01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:59.480
D-Don't worry about
me. I'll be in the sun.

1542
01:23:00.949 --> 01:23:02.951
Knowing you're happy makes me happy.

1543
01:23:05.018 --> 01:23:07.321
But it doesn't work unless you're happy.

1544
01:23:09.858 --> 01:23:11.225
Oh. Larry.

1545
01:23:22.971 --> 01:23:24.104
Okay.

1546
01:23:24.204 --> 01:23:27.174
You better go break the
news to Karen.

1547
01:23:27.876 --> 01:23:29.109
Okay.

1548
01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:31.713
Okay.

1549
01:23:34.916 --> 01:23:36.751
- Okay.
- It's the right thing.

1550
01:23:37.417 --> 01:23:38.720
Wow.

1551
01:25:03.771 --> 01:25:07.508
<i>The train doors
will close in 30 minutes.</i>

1552
01:25:07.942 --> 01:25:10.477
Babe. we shouldn't flaunt
our sexy love in front of his face.

1553
01:25:10.578 --> 01:25:11.946
He has no one.

1554
01:25:12.046 --> 01:25:13.146
- Hey.
- Hi.

1555
01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:15.883
How are you holding up. Lar?

1556
01:25:15.984 --> 01:25:17.986
Eh. I'm all right.

1557
01:25:18.086 --> 01:25:19.887
No hard feelings.
right. Larry?

1558
01:25:19.988 --> 01:25:22.757
For what it's worth. I totally
thought you had it there for a moment.

1559
01:25:22.857 --> 01:25:24.157
Thanks.

1560
01:25:25.425 --> 01:25:27.629
What's this? Are you two together now?

1561
01:25:27.729 --> 01:25:30.832
- Yeah.
- We're gonna give it another go.

1562
01:25:30.932 --> 01:25:32.199
Good.

1563
01:25:32.299 --> 01:25:35.003
You really showed us that living
without someone is a hollow mess.

1564
01:25:35.103 --> 01:25:37.005
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1565
01:25:37.105 --> 01:25:38.539
- Okay.
- Give us a minute. please.

1566
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.208
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Totally.
I miss you already.

1567
01:25:41.308 --> 01:25:43.377
God.

1568
01:25:45.813 --> 01:25:46.748
You wanna?

1569
01:25:56.289 --> 01:25:59.794
I gotta say. I'm really
proud of you. Larry.

1570
01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:02.162
You're doing the right thing.

1571
01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.565
I feel terrible.

1572
01:26:05.399 --> 01:26:07.501
Yeah. That happens.

1573
01:26:07.969 --> 01:26:10.571
Sometimes doing the right
thing does feel terrible.

1574
01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:16.309
So. you never told me why
you ended up staying here.

1575
01:26:19.013 --> 01:26:20.515
Um. coming here...

1576
01:26:23.417 --> 01:26:26.654
I'll just say that coming
here was an improvement for me.

1577
01:26:27.855 --> 01:26:31.859
Here. I get to help lost
souls find their happiness.

1578
01:26:33.161 --> 01:26:35.530
And that gives me a sense of purpose.

1579
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:39.567
But after time. you stop caring
about what's best for people.

1580
01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:41.536
You're just pushing them along

1581
01:26:41.636 --> 01:26:45.573
and making sure the afterlife
is ticking over. you know?

1582
01:26:45.673 --> 01:26:46.708
Sell. sell. sell.

1583
01:26:49.342 --> 01:26:51.646
But then you came along.

1584
01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.650
Yeah. With that great ordinary love.

1585
01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:00.253
And you reminded me of
why I chose this place.

1586
01:27:01.089 --> 01:27:03.223
So. thank you for that. Larry.

1587
01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:08.428
Well. I guess you're welcome.

1588
01:27:13.968 --> 01:27:15.402
So...

1589
01:27:18.673 --> 01:27:20.675
have you chosen your eternity?

1590
01:27:24.112 --> 01:27:26.446
Yeah. I think I have.

1591
01:27:38.593 --> 01:27:40.228
- Okay. Come on.
- What?

1592
01:27:40.327 --> 01:27:42.130
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh. God. Oh. no.

1593
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:44.297
Oh. yeah. Oh. yeah.

1594
01:27:45.298 --> 01:27:46.466
Oh. boy.

1595
01:27:47.367 --> 01:27:48.870
- Oh.
- Hey.

1596
01:27:49.402 --> 01:27:51.038
- Yeah.
- It's not bad. huh?

1597
01:27:51.139 --> 01:27:52.339
Oh. it's...

1598
01:27:55.143 --> 01:27:56.276
It's very charming.

1599
01:27:59.947 --> 01:28:01.783
Shit.

1600
01:28:02.917 --> 01:28:03.885
- A car crash.
- Oh.

1601
01:28:03.985 --> 01:28:06.053
Uh. old age. Cancer.

1602
01:28:06.587 --> 01:28:09.023
- War.
- Oh. War. Which one?

1603
01:28:09.123 --> 01:28:11.626
- I or II?
- Um. Korea.

1604
01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:13.426
- Which counts. Yeah.
- Oh.

1605
01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.070
Well done.

1606
01:28:23.171 --> 01:28:24.337
Thank you.

1607
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:32.580
I love you so much.

1608
01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:34.849
So much.

1609
01:29:14.387 --> 01:29:16.257
- Hey.
- Hi.

1610
01:29:16.356 --> 01:29:19.594
Uh. so you like books?

1611
01:29:21.662 --> 01:29:23.331
Uh. yeah. I'm a librarian. so...

1612
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:24.632
Can I help you with something?

1613
01:29:24.732 --> 01:29:26.033
Yeah. I can read.

1614
01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:28.102
That's good.
You're in the right place.

1615
01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:31.504
- What's that one?
- That's Dickens. <i>Great Expectations</i> .

1616
01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:33.140
Any good?

1617
01:29:34.141 --> 01:29:36.010
Um. you know. I haven't read it.

1618
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:38.445
But that's 'cause I
don't really love Dickens.

1619
01:29:38.546 --> 01:29:39.747
- Oh.
- It's a big controversy.

1620
01:29:39.847 --> 01:29:42.750
Yeah. I hate him.

1621
01:29:44.318 --> 01:29:45.920
You got a... You got a nice laugh.

1622
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.555
Oh. thank you.

1623
01:29:50.258 --> 01:29:51.692
- I'm Joan.
- Larry.

1624
01:29:51.792 --> 01:29:53.460
- Nice to meet you. Larry.
- Nice to meet you.

1625
01:29:53.561 --> 01:29:55.696
Okay.

1626
01:29:56.631 --> 01:29:59.499
Okay.

1627
01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.535
- That's it. slow and steady.
- Okay.

1628
01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:04.238
Okay.

1629
01:30:04.338 --> 01:30:05.840
Keep up the good work. Joan.

1630
01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.142
Oh. yeah. Thanks. Simon.
Go fuck yourself.

1631
01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:11.679
- It's good.
- Yeah. really good.

1632
01:30:11.779 --> 01:30:13.147
- Oh. it feels good.
- Come on. let's go.

1633
01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:14.414
Okay.

1634
01:30:23.456 --> 01:30:24.659
What is that?

1635
01:30:26.027 --> 01:30:27.128
Who's that?

1636
01:30:28.963 --> 01:30:31.599
How is it that he already
needs to poop again?

1637
01:30:31.699 --> 01:30:33.433
Four months old and he's
already shitting like a man.

1638
01:30:33.534 --> 01:30:34.969
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

1639
01:30:35.468 --> 01:30:37.171
- Oh. honey.
- What's that?

1640
01:30:37.271 --> 01:30:38.205
You stink.

1641
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:45.112
Janet. Connor. Connor. Janet.

1642
01:30:45.212 --> 01:30:47.882
- They died doing a... What--
- Gender reveal party.

1643
01:30:47.982 --> 01:30:49.984
- Yeah. Gender reveal party.
- Yeah. There was so much blood.

1644
01:30:50.084 --> 01:30:51.419
Everywhere. Just oozing.

1645
01:30:51.519 --> 01:30:53.087
We didn't see it coming.
We'd al... We looked in.

1646
01:30:53.187 --> 01:30:54.655
We were like. "Oh.
what's going on in here?"

1647
01:30:54.755 --> 01:30:55.990
Boom! Blew our heads right off.

1648
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:57.658
- I love it when you do that.
- Whoa.

1649
01:31:04.165 --> 01:31:05.700
Thank you. Fenwick.

1650
01:31:14.008 --> 01:31:16.544
Are you sure you don't wanna
come? The powder's fresh. J-Bae.

1651
01:31:16.644 --> 01:31:18.478
Oh. I got plenty of powder yesterday.

1652
01:31:18.579 --> 01:31:20.581
- Powdered out. So...
- You sure?

1653
01:31:20.681 --> 01:31:22.550
- Uh-huh. Have fun.
-  Okay. Give me a kiss.

1654
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:23.651
- Okay.
- I love you.

1655
01:31:23.751 --> 01:31:25.286
- I love you too. Bye.
- Bye.

1656
01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:26.486
Cute.

1657
01:31:27.955 --> 01:31:29.623
You sure?

1658
01:31:34.929 --> 01:31:39.667
You know. people die at these
things? I saw it on the Internet.

1659
01:31:40.468 --> 01:31:43.904
- It's a gender reveal party.
- They're lethal and stupid.

1660
01:31:44.005 --> 01:31:45.906
Oh. just
let 'em make a fuss.

1661
01:31:46.007 --> 01:31:49.310
I mean. I get. you
know. eliminating the surprise

1662
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:50.811
but it's not party-worthy.

1663
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:52.680
You know. one
of the great joys of my life

1664
01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.315
has been allowing for surprises.

1665
01:31:54.415 --> 01:31:58.319
Remember when you were
convinced that Zach was a girl?

1666
01:31:58.419 --> 01:32:01.122
Well. everything
has to be a party nowadays.

1667
01:32:01.222 --> 01:32:03.457
- You hate parties.
- Everything has to be an event.

1668
01:32:03.557 --> 01:32:05.726
No. no.
You hate having fun.

1669
01:32:05.826 --> 01:32:07.795
You know. kids
have preschool graduations now.

1670
01:32:07.895 --> 01:32:09.730
You haven't achieved anything yet.

1671
01:32:10.965 --> 01:32:13.100
Can we just... Can we just enjoy it?

1672
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:18.272
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Look. lady.

1673
01:32:18.372 --> 01:32:20.841
It's not too healthy to be
coming back here all the time.

1674
01:32:21.842 --> 01:32:23.911
It's important to move on.

1675
01:32:26.113 --> 01:32:27.214
Mmm.

1676
01:32:32.787 --> 01:32:34.088
This is perfect. huh?

1677
01:32:36.257 --> 01:32:37.491
Huh?

1678
01:32:41.729 --> 01:32:42.897
You're okay?

1679
01:32:44.999 --> 01:32:46.133
Yeah.

1680
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.302
- Yeah?
- Just a little cold.

1681
01:32:50.738 --> 01:32:52.840
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1682
01:33:07.855 --> 01:33:10.224
I booked us on a hot
air balloon later on.

1683
01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.629
And. uh. there's a new
couple in... in unit nine.

1684
01:33:15.729 --> 01:33:17.566
I think they'd. uh... Ooh.

1685
01:33:17.665 --> 01:33:19.400
I think they'd make
great doubles partners.

1686
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.269
If I meet any more new
people. I'm going to explode.

1687
01:33:24.772 --> 01:33:26.841
And then what would you complain about?

1688
01:33:27.509 --> 01:33:28.609
- What?
- Come on. Joanie.

1689
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:30.177
you love to complain.

1690
01:33:31.078 --> 01:33:33.614
That's not a thing people love.

1691
01:33:36.217 --> 01:33:37.218
You okay?

1692
01:33:38.352 --> 01:33:39.920
I made a mistake.

1693
01:33:41.822 --> 01:33:43.624
Did you lose your skis again?

1694
01:33:46.894 --> 01:33:49.663
No. I. uh...

1695
01:33:53.568 --> 01:33:55.903
I made a mistake
coming h-here with you.

1696
01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:04.812
Okay.

1697
01:34:06.247 --> 01:34:07.114
What'd I do wrong now?

1698
01:34:07.214 --> 01:34:09.150
Nothing. Oh. nothing.
No. you're perfect.

1699
01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:12.286
I know you say you're
not b-but you are.

1700
01:34:12.386 --> 01:34:16.390
You're kind and brave and
smart. That's how I know.

1701
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:19.393
I waited all these years for this.

1702
01:34:20.327 --> 01:34:21.530
This.

1703
01:34:22.329 --> 01:34:25.299
Why can't you just enjoy it?
We're in a literal paradise.

1704
01:34:25.399 --> 01:34:28.836
Yeah. I'm sorry I
didn't realize it sooner.

1705
01:34:28.936 --> 01:34:30.504
I think I just... I think I just

1706
01:34:30.605 --> 01:34:32.706
- got really caught up in everything.
- Joanie. what the...

1707
01:34:32.806 --> 01:34:34.708
And maybe it would've
worked between us in life.

1708
01:34:34.808 --> 01:34:36.243
You know? Maybe not.

1709
01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:38.979
But I-I can't pretend that my
world didn't continue without you.

1710
01:34:39.079 --> 01:34:42.551
I am not asking you to. I
have never asked it of you.

1711
01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:45.152
- Unlike you. I don't hide things.
- Well. what's that supposed to mean?

1712
01:34:45.252 --> 01:34:49.190
I grit my teeth every single day
so you can go to that damn tunnel.

1713
01:34:54.428 --> 01:34:57.364
Joanie. we
were happiest together.

1714
01:34:57.464 --> 01:34:59.366
Yeah. Of course we were.

1715
01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.536
It was young love. It was...

1716
01:35:01.636 --> 01:35:06.575
It was love without the burden
of a mortgage or a job or kids.

1717
01:35:06.675 --> 01:35:09.710
It was. you know. the kind of
love you feel before knowing loss.

1718
01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:11.412
It was everything. but...

1719
01:35:12.846 --> 01:35:14.448
Love isn't just one happy moment.

1720
01:35:14.549 --> 01:35:16.183
Right? It's a million.

1721
01:35:16.283 --> 01:35:20.988
And it's bickering in the car. and
supporting someone when they need it.

1722
01:35:21.088 --> 01:35:24.058
and it's growing together.
and looking after each other.

1723
01:35:24.158 --> 01:35:26.794
We can grow together now. We
can look after each other now.

1724
01:35:26.894 --> 01:35:29.430
I mean. Luke. Honestly?

1725
01:35:29.531 --> 01:35:31.799
Am I living up to the memory?

1726
01:35:34.201 --> 01:35:38.772
You waited so long in
that... that artificial place.

1727
01:35:38.872 --> 01:35:41.108
but here. this is real.

1728
01:35:41.676 --> 01:35:43.545
And... And you're living and...

1729
01:35:44.078 --> 01:35:47.214
I'm giving you permission.
Go live without me.

1730
01:35:47.314 --> 01:35:49.316
Oh. you're giving me
permission? Are you...

1731
01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:50.918
- Are you giving me permission?
- Okay. I'm sorry.

1732
01:35:51.018 --> 01:35:53.254
- That was a little condescending.
- Thank you so much. my Highness.

1733
01:35:53.354 --> 01:35:54.522
- I'm your humble servant.
- Okay.

1734
01:35:54.623 --> 01:35:57.124
- Thank you so much for the permission.
- I'm sorry.

1735
01:35:59.393 --> 01:36:01.128
This is not fair.

1736
01:36:04.699 --> 01:36:05.833
It's not fair.

1737
01:36:07.234 --> 01:36:08.202
I know.

1738
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:10.938
But...

1739
01:36:12.707 --> 01:36:13.708
I have to go back.

1740
01:36:13.807 --> 01:36:15.342
You out of your mind?

1741
01:36:15.442 --> 01:36:18.312
The moment you step through
a red door. they'll find you.

1742
01:36:19.714 --> 01:36:21.549
They'll put you into the void.

1743
01:36:22.249 --> 01:36:23.250
I have to try.

1744
01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:27.821
No. you don't. You
can stay here with me.

1745
01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:33.494
Please stay.

1746
01:36:38.767 --> 01:36:40.000
Please stay.

1747
01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.274
I'm sorry.

1748
01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:52.313
I really do love you.

1749
01:37:37.559 --> 01:37:38.859
Okay.

1750
01:37:41.028 --> 01:37:44.599
Hands up. Fenwick. Give me the keys. You
got it. Joanie. You've got it. Joanie.

1751
01:37:44.699 --> 01:37:46.467
Yeah. Stick 'em up. stick 'em up.

1752
01:37:46.568 --> 01:37:47.702
Stick 'em up. Fenny.

1753
01:37:47.802 --> 01:37:50.304
Are you ready to die. Fenny? You
want me to cut you? I'll cut...

1754
01:37:50.404 --> 01:37:51.238
Oh. God.

1755
01:37:51.338 --> 01:37:53.173
Such a sweet boy. He's so sweet.

1756
01:37:53.273 --> 01:37:55.976
Unless I do some... Okay. Yeah.

1757
01:37:56.076 --> 01:37:57.878
You know that won't work.

1758
01:37:59.781 --> 01:38:01.048
I mean...

1759
01:38:02.416 --> 01:38:03.618
it might.

1760
01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.635
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1761
01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:25.305
You're gonna need a distraction.

1762
01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:30.444
Luke...

1763
01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.113
I'm so sorry.

1764
01:38:33.914 --> 01:38:35.315
Yeah.

1765
01:38:35.983 --> 01:38:37.184
I know.

1766
01:38:43.725 --> 01:38:46.528
So. you remember how I used
to do some local theater?

1767
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:05.880
Please don't touch the exhibits.
Remember the exhibits aren't real.

1768
01:39:05.979 --> 01:39:07.314
She left.

1769
01:39:09.717 --> 01:39:13.020
- Why?
- Oh. buddy.

1770
01:39:13.588 --> 01:39:16.323
I know. I know it's tough.

1771
01:39:16.423 --> 01:39:17.357
I know. I know.

1772
01:39:17.458 --> 01:39:18.992
But... B-But trust
me. it'll get better.

1773
01:39:19.092 --> 01:39:23.063
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah. that's
right. J-Just let it out. big guy.

1774
01:39:23.163 --> 01:39:26.634
Let it out. Let it out. Let it all out.

1775
01:39:26.734 --> 01:39:28.335
Okay? It's okay. It's okay.

1776
01:39:28.435 --> 01:39:30.638
It's tough today. b-but
there's always tomorrow.

1777
01:39:30.738 --> 01:39:32.473
It's tough today. there's
always tomorrow. huh?

1778
01:39:32.574 --> 01:39:34.341
- That's right. That's right. Okay.
- Okay. good.

1779
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:36.043
I just needed a good cry. I think.

1780
01:39:36.143 --> 01:39:37.444
Yeah. I get that.

1781
01:39:37.545 --> 01:39:39.446
- I remember when my old lady dumped--
- Anyway. thanks.

1782
01:39:39.547 --> 01:39:42.817
- I'm gonna pop in for. uh...
- For old time's sake.

1783
01:39:43.484 --> 01:39:45.486
Yeah. but y-you didn't take a ticket.

1784
01:39:48.155 --> 01:39:50.390
I need to stop being such a giver.

1785
01:40:03.638 --> 01:40:05.740
You should hurry up.

1786
01:40:07.307 --> 01:40:08.275
Yeah.

1787
01:40:10.879 --> 01:40:12.112
Goodbye. Luke.

1788
01:40:14.147 --> 01:40:15.349
Goodbye. Joan.

1789
01:40:18.553 --> 01:40:19.521
Yeah.

1790
01:41:09.804 --> 01:41:12.272
- Honey. it was the last time. I promise.
- No.

1791
01:41:12.372 --> 01:41:14.742
Will you please just calm
down and let's discuss this?

1792
01:41:14.842 --> 01:41:16.778
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down!
- There she is!

1793
01:41:16.878 --> 01:41:17.812
Stop right there!

1794
01:41:17.912 --> 01:41:19.814
- You are not taking my child!
- What do you care?

1795
01:41:19.914 --> 01:41:22.684
- Get in here right now!
- Stop her! Stop her!

1796
01:41:22.784 --> 01:41:23.751
I hate you!

1797
01:41:23.851 --> 01:41:25.452
...you would treat me like that?

1798
01:41:26.219 --> 01:41:29.891
- What if I'm pregnant?
- It'll be okay. Joanie. I promise.

1799
01:41:30.457 --> 01:41:31.826
I'm sorry. the check bounced.

1800
01:41:31.926 --> 01:41:33.193
Please.

1801
01:41:33.293 --> 01:41:34.729
- I love you.
- I love you.

1802
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:37.899
There's nowhere to go!

1803
01:41:38.332 --> 01:41:41.168
- We're sorry for your loss.
- No. no. no. no.

1804
01:41:44.504 --> 01:41:46.608
Come on. come
on. come on! Hurry up!

1805
01:41:50.110 --> 01:41:51.278
Stop!

1806
01:41:59.887 --> 01:42:00.855
Shit.

1807
01:42:08.295 --> 01:42:09.463
Jesus. Larry.
I don't wanna--

1808
01:42:09.564 --> 01:42:11.264
I don't wanna have this
conversation again. I am--

1809
01:42:11.365 --> 01:42:13.635
No. I am not. I am not
comparing you to him!

1810
01:42:13.735 --> 01:42:16.971
No. I have never compared you to him!
And I don't wanna have this conversation!

1811
01:42:17.071 --> 01:42:18.271
It's humiliating. Joan.

1812
01:42:18.372 --> 01:42:19.674
- I can't do this anymore.
- Don't move!

1813
01:42:19.774 --> 01:42:22.510
God. well. she brought
it up. What am I supposed to say?

1814
01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:24.311
I mean. I... I get it.
She doesn't like me.

1815
01:42:24.411 --> 01:42:26.047
- No. no. she literally said...
- You'll grow on her.

1816
01:42:26.146 --> 01:42:27.815
- ..."I don't like him."
- You grow on people. Larry.

1817
01:42:27.915 --> 01:42:30.084
Great. I'm like
a fungus. I'm a mushroom.

1818
01:42:58.211 --> 01:42:59.681
Upstairs! Upstairs!

1819
01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:00.882
Larry.

1820
01:43:03.685 --> 01:43:04.886
Hurry!

1821
01:43:05.553 --> 01:43:08.089
Come on. get up. Grab her! Grab her!

1822
01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.702
Okay.

1823
01:43:42.957 --> 01:43:46.027
<i>Train

1825
01:43:56.104 --> 01:43:57.538
Excuse me. Hi.

1826
01:43:57.638 --> 01:44:01.609
I-I need to know which
eternity Larry Cutler went to.

1827
01:44:01.976 --> 01:44:05.146
Ma'am. there have been
425.000 Larry Cutlers.

1828
01:44:05.245 --> 01:44:06.647
Could you be more specific?

1829
01:44:10.918 --> 01:44:11.886
Oh.

1830
01:44:14.055 --> 01:44:16.524
Shoot. oh. shoot. oh. shoot.

1831
01:44:16.624 --> 01:44:19.894
<i>Red door

1832
01:44:20.895 --> 01:44:21.829
Excuse me.

1833
01:44:25.066 --> 01:44:27.902
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.

1834
01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:32.974
You know. I've been
thinking a lot about it and.

1835
01:44:33.074 --> 01:44:37.377
you know. I-I think that maybe
we should consider being poly.

1836
01:44:37.477 --> 01:44:40.114
I'm not much
of a multitasker. babe.

1837
01:44:40.214 --> 01:44:41.716
- What?
-  I'm a one-woman man.

1838
01:44:41.816 --> 01:44:42.717
Oh.
real--

1839
01:44:42.817 --> 01:44:45.052
- Oh. my God.
- Watch where you're going. lady.

1840
01:44:45.586 --> 01:44:47.354
Go over there. Over there.

1841
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:50.591
You guys see a woman
come running this way?

1842
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:52.827
- No.
- She went that way.

1843
01:44:52.927 --> 01:44:54.762
- Thanks. Come on. Let's go.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1844
01:44:54.862 --> 01:44:55.863
Good luck. you guys.

1845
01:44:56.998 --> 01:44:57.999
Let's go. Move.

1846
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.168
Joan.

1847
01:45:00.268 --> 01:45:02.003
You're such a romantic.

1848
01:45:02.103 --> 01:45:04.672
We can sneak her into one of
those old. disused eternities.

1849
01:45:04.772 --> 01:45:06.473
Not one of the racist ones.
But you'll be safe there.

1850
01:45:06.574 --> 01:45:08.876
- Security never checks them.
- Where did he go?

1851
01:45:08.976 --> 01:45:09.944
Who?

1852
01:45:10.044 --> 01:45:11.411
Where's Larry?

1853
01:45:11.512 --> 01:45:14.248
Oh. my God. I knew
it. I knew it. I knew it.

1854
01:45:14.347 --> 01:45:16.884
Where is he?

1855
01:45:47.782 --> 01:45:48.749
Oh.

1856
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:52.053
It's a lot out there. huh?

1857
01:45:53.855 --> 01:45:54.922
Intense.

1858
01:45:55.756 --> 01:45:56.891
Yeah.

1859
01:45:57.258 --> 01:46:00.460
I know somewhere you
could really unwind.

1860
01:46:00.561 --> 01:46:02.597
Come on. Marge. You know the rules.

1861
01:46:02.697 --> 01:46:04.832
I'm just trying to help a girl out.

1862
01:46:05.199 --> 01:46:06.734
I know what I want now.

1863
01:46:08.536 --> 01:46:10.338
I could show you my eternity.

1864
01:46:10.437 --> 01:46:12.540
It's. uh. just around the corner.

1865
01:46:15.475 --> 01:46:16.844
You heard the lady.

1866
01:46:19.513 --> 01:46:21.414
I preferred the last barman.

1867
01:46:28.823 --> 01:46:30.858
You look like you could use a drink.

1868
01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:31.926
Oh.

1869
01:46:34.195 --> 01:46:35.162
Yeah.

1870
01:46:35.963 --> 01:46:37.497
You never left.

1871
01:46:38.232 --> 01:46:39.367
Nah.

1872
01:46:39.466 --> 01:46:42.003
Sand
really does get everywhere.

1873
01:46:42.637 --> 01:46:47.074
Yeah. Turns out that
the cold is just cold.

1874
01:47:02.323 --> 01:47:04.491
- Is that for you?
- Oh. yeah.

1875
01:47:04.592 --> 01:47:06.193
I'm kind of a fugitive.

1876
01:47:06.994 --> 01:47:08.029
Where you gonna go?

1877
01:47:10.097 --> 01:47:11.431
I know a place.

1878
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.535
It could be dangerous.

1879
01:47:24.679 --> 01:47:26.213
When do we leave?

1880
01:47:53.774 --> 01:47:56.610
Well. looks like Oakdale.

1881
01:47:58.612 --> 01:47:59.747
It's perfect.

1881
01:48:00.305 --> 01:49:00.811
