﻿1
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.836
Is this better?

2
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.520
Universal translation.

3
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.360
You hear Yautja. others hear their
language.

4
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.960
Oh boy.

5
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.460
This isn't great for you.

6
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.000
Then eat you while you can't move.

7
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.180
I could help you. but...

8
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120
I need a hand.

9
00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:10.385
Yautja might hunt alone. but...

10
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.300
may die alone too.

11
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720
Kalisk.

12
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.780
You're hunting the Kalisk.

13
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.990
Excuse you. sir.

14
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.710
I'm synthetic.

15
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.370
I was built and deployed by the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation for research.

16
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.250
Because their humans wouldn't last a day
on this planet.

17
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.590
We found that...

18
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.220
Look.

19
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.180
Many Yautja have come for the Great
Kalisk.

20
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.020
And none have survived it.

21
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.120
Or Genna.

22
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I've seen the Kalisk.

23
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.420
I survived it.

24
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820
Here's my proposal.

25
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.820
You take me along with you. and I'll guide
you to its den.

26
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.400
Once there. I get my legs. you get your
trophy. and everyone's a winner.

27
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Deal?

28
00:26:27.473 --> 00:26:28.473
Oh. yeah.

29
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.290
I've seen the Kalisk.

30
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.790
Good luck with your journey.

31
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.470
I'm just gonna...

32
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720
go on my journey.

33
00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.060
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

34
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:06.980
Hey!

35
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.713
I've already shown you that I can be
useful to you.

36
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.100
Yes.

37
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.020
Yes. Exactly.

38
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.140
Like a tool.

39
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.900
The only way to survive Genna is to work
with it.

40
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.236
And I know how.

41
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.500
And with the right tool...

42
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.700
You could get the Kalisk.

43
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.060
You could be the first.

44
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.183
You may call me thief.

45
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.030
And what does the chewing?

46
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.850
Your outside veins. or your inner veins?

47
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:54.870
Inside teeth.

48
00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.850
Oh. what should I call you?

49
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.550
Hm?

50
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.920
How fast were you going when your ship
crashed?

51
00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:13.700
Faster than sublight speed?

52
00:28:14.335 --> 00:28:15.455
We haven't cracked that yet.

53
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.540
Also. that plasma sword is interesting.

54
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.150
Is it unique to your clan?

55
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:20.860
And what may I call you?

56
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.980
I call these Imbre Anguis.

57
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.770
We just got a snack.

58
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.360
You catch more flies with honey than you
do with vinegar.

59
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.500
Drink my wine.

60
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.720
Predatory organisms are my specific area
of expertise.

61
00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:57.930
I've studied Yautja extensively.

62
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.130
It's an impressive culture.

63
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.160
Here. ask me anything.

64
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.390
I bet I have the answer.

65
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.500
Very funny.

66
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.800
And you still haven't told me your name.

67
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.690
Okay. sure.

68
00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.070
Well. let's back up and start at the
beginning.

69
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.840
It's so beautiful.

70
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.540
After all the time I've been stuck here.
I'm tired of the view.

71
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.560
When?

72
00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:16.080
Well. we arrived on Genna two years ago.
and we built a base.

73
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:22.700
Then I was in the vulture's nest for the
most exciting 13 days. 7 hours.

74
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.880
43 minutes. and 2 seconds of my life.

75
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.260
But I always knew someone would come.

76
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.160
I was just wrong about who.

77
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.470
Tessa.

78
00:30:42.675 --> 00:30:45.210
Our crew is made up entirely of synths.

79
00:30:46.285 --> 00:30:47.590
But Tessa and I are special.

80
00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.590
We have a higher sensitivity than the
others.

81
00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.330
The sensitivity is what allows us to
understand the creatures on this planet.

82
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.550
We were created to work in tandem.

83
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.230
Me cooped up in the lab.

84
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.100
Tessa out in the field.

85
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.550
Until the wonderful day Tessa let me come
with her.

86
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.630
We were exploring Genna.

87
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.230
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

88
00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:24.445
Separated me...

89
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.300
and us.

90
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:33.170
The last sound I remember
hearing... was Tessa...

91
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.120
calling out my name.

92
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520
Reaching for me.

93
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.070
Then the Kalisk.

94
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040
I didn't know what to do.

95
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.820
But I refuse to believe she's dead.

96
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.150
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...

97
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.611
Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia... Thia... Thia... Tessa!

98
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:47.650
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia...

99
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:28.880
Hello. Tessa.

100
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.280
The company is not pleased.

101
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.800
Continued failure will result in your
decommission.

102
00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.140
Where's Thia?

103
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.240
The beauty has been.

104
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.300
Two warriors... Dekin Thia.

105
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520
On the hunt.

106
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.640
Quick question.

107
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.520
What should I be doing?

108
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.500
Don't worry. my son.

109
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.000
Bone bison... they're Kalisk food.

110
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:26.200
This is so exciting.

111
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.760
Hunting with the Yautja?

112
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.320
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

113
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.700
Just a warning.

114
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.020
Razor grass.

115
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.840
It'll cut you the ribbons.

116
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.100
We'll just go around.

117
00:34:55.795 --> 00:34:57.380
We might not be alone in this hunt.

118
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.440
What an odd critter.

119
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.330
I've never seen you before.

120
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380
Thia.

121
00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:19.415
Nice to meet you.

122
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.700
Looks like your competition is better.

123
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.300
Careful

124
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.220
up in these trees.

125
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.540
There are lunabugs.

126
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:18.850
Coming up behind you.

127
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.960
Stronger than it looks.

128
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.323
Not a Kalisk.

129
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.960
That was the best hunt I've ever been on.

130
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.720
This is the dream team right here.

131
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.980
The Dynamic Three.

132
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.160
The Dynamic Trio.

133
00:40:48.475 --> 00:40:49.480
The Dynamic Trio!

134
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:50.780
Trio!

135
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.221
Remember when we went down the tree?

136
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.760
That monster's mouth?
I mean... Uggh.

137
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.340
Didn't smell great. didn't smell great.
but...

138
00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.140
...we got him.

139
00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.540
We got him.

140
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.560
And then we met you. our little sweet
little little thing...

141
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.280
Thank you. Seriously.

142
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.500
For that experience.

143
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720
Truly amazing.

144
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.240
Thrilling.
Truly thrilling.

145
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.480
What was your favorite part?

146
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:19.940
What was the smallest me appetizer you've
ever eaten?

147
00:41:51.065 --> 00:41:57.230
A little pause...

148
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.100
and we are back.

149
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.320
I think she's marking you.

150
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.190
She wants you to be a part of her clan.

151
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.700
Maybe she's lost.

152
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.100
What do you mean?

153
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.520
Don't all Yautja have family?

154
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.800
So you never had anyone looking out for
you?

155
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.130
What happened to him?

156
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.740
You're grieving.

157
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.580
You're here because you lost your brother.

158
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.510
I'm here because traveling with you is the
best way to get back to Tessa.

159
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:19.431
When I was in that vulture's nest. I
was so afraid I would never see her again.

160
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.070
So then you swiped for all I could.

161
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.910
I can survive on my own.

162
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.000
But who would want to survive on their
own?

163
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.760
Delay us all horror. Tessa.

164
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480
Sister.

165
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.180
Huh.

166
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.470
Yeah.

167
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.810
I guess she is.

168
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.530
I have... a sister.

169
00:43:58.325 --> 00:43:59.325
What a lovely thought.

170
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360
I need to find her.

171
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.100
I need to find her.

172
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.209
Excuse me?

173
00:44:20.951 --> 00:44:21.951
Was that a joke?

174
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:38.550
Fish wonder now.

175
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.020
Where is Kiwi?

176
00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.880
We can't leave Bud.

177
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.200
- Bunt?
- Yeah.

178
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.520
Bud.

179
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.700
I named her.

180
00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.820
Tessa Yautja I need to find her.

181
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.600
You're not alone.

182
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.860
I'm with you.

183
00:48:03.455 --> 00:48:05.140
The tree would have eaten us without her.

184
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.260
You're not alone.

185
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.660
You're not alone.

186
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.860
You're not alone.

187
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.040
Bud saved us.

188
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.410
She spit on you to claim you as part of
her family.

189
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:46.830
Why'd your father kill your brother?

190
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:16.470
On Earth...

191
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.960
there's a predator known as the wolf.

192
00:50:20.845 --> 00:50:21.845
It's a powerful creature.

193
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.390
They hunt in packs.

194
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:28.430
They're very loyal.

195
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.920
The leader of the pack is the Alpha.
known as the most dominant.

196
00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.700
No.

197
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:47.060
The Alpha isn't the wolf who kills the
most.

198
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:53.180
The Alpha is actually the one who best
protects the pack.

199
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:20.861
The Kalisk destroyed
most of our mission team.

200
00:52:24.431 --> 00:52:25.550
There am I.

201
00:53:11.346 --> 00:53:12.560
It's about to be.

202
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.020
Oh. of course.

203
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480
Right.

204
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.100
Thank you. Dek.

205
00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:30.770
I'm never going to forget this.

206
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.230
Dek. there's something I have to tell
you.

207
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.830
You need to leave now.

208
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.020
Location beacon activated.

209
00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.620
Go on.

210
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:18.320
I called Tessa.

211
00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:19.740
The company is on its way.

212
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.600
You can't be here when they arrive.

213
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.420
So did I. Dek.

214
00:54:29.735 --> 00:54:32.200
The company sent us here to capture the
Kalisk.

215
00:54:44.095 --> 00:54:45.095
Dek. you can't kill it.

216
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.140
I'm sorry.

217
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.610
You have to leave.

218
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.120
I needed you to help bring me here.

219
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.280
I'm trying to help you. Dek.

220
00:55:05.865 --> 00:55:09.271
Do you think your brother saved your life
just so you could die here?

221
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.700
The Yautja call they're weak.

222
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:26.860
Why were you spared?

223
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.700
I read Thia's logs.

224
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:52.460
You never told her why your brother
protected you.

225
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:59.020
You mock her war. war seer.

226
01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.740
That's correct.

227
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:09.860
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

228
01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.540
It is a great honor... for you.

229
01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.590
Tessa.

230
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:52.930
You made it.

231
01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:55.650
We made it.

232
01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:01.740
I've seen so much.

233
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.830
I have so much to tell you.

234
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.570
I saw such incredible creatures.

235
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:12.090
The Yautja is a great traveling companion.

236
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.980
Thia. you were right about the Kalisk.

237
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:23.970
The creature is a regenerative miracle.

238
01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.830
Humanity will thank us.

239
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:31.590
We have the Kalisk?

240
01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:32.790
Yes.

241
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.790
And Mother will be pleased with your
additional catch.

242
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.100
Additional catch?

243
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.000
The Yautja is not an ideal specimen.

244
01:03:59.013 --> 01:04:01.320
No. Not ideal.

245
01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.460
But its technology is valuable.

246
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.900
We can salvage its weapons and leave the
Yautja.

247
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.240
Good idea.

248
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.780
But it's so malformed.

249
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:50.506
We're going to need a sample. For research.

250
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:02.950
He was not the goal of our mission.

251
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.970
Tessa. he is deficient.

252
01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:12.290
Tessa!

253
01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:17.690
Tessa!

254
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.610
Tessa!

255
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:19.850
Tessa!

256
01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.860
Tessa!

257
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:31.880
This is what is asked of us.

258
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.260
We can be more than what they ask of us.

259
01:05:43.795 --> 01:05:44.795
What can we be?

260
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:48.740
Sisters.

261
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.620
Thia.

262
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.890
Do you know why Mother gave us feelings?

263
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.360
So we could understand the creatures on
this planet.

264
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520
And exploit them.

265
01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:38.265
The Yautja is different.

266
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.950
He rescued me.

267
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.350
Like you rescued me.

268
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.910
I did not come here to rescue you.

269
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.890
I am completing our mission.

270
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:57.110
When we first faced the Kalisk...

271
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.930
I tried to protect you.

272
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.390
And that almost cost me everything.

273
01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.870
What do you mean. Tessa?

274
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.830
I almost made the same mistake the
Yautja's brother made.

275
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.590
The weak must be culled.

276
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:20.710
And Thia...

277
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.610
You're broken.

278
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:33.170
Tessa. incoming message from Mother.

279
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:35.630
Motivate the Yautja to explain its
weapons.

280
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:36.950
And the unit?

281
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.140
Box her up.

282
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.440
Why are you speaking its language?

283
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:19.050
You heard the orders.

284
01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:21.250
I'm asking it to explain this device.

285
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:25.270
What is the device?

286
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.930
What did it say?

287
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.160
He says it's a map.

288
01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.763
How does it work?

289
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:08.816
Wolf.

290
01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:25.900
Hello. Mother.

291
01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.140
Tessa.

292
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.400
We're about to load the Kalisk.

293
01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.660
Priority one complete.

294
01:16:33.305 --> 01:16:34.760
The specimen has been acquired.

295
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:36.330
Thank you. Tessa.

296
01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.660
We truly are building a better world.

297
01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.140
And what is the status of the Yautja?

298
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:46.360
The Yautja is a defective specimen.

299
01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.140
What is the status of the Yautja?

300
01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.300
I'm sorry. Mother.

301
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.640
The Yautja is dead.

302
01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.660
Then the Yautja is no longer a threat.

303
01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.660
The company will be pleased.

304
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:53.750
Nicely done.

305
01:19:44.211 --> 01:19:45.211
Good job.

306
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.510
Don't move.

307
01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560
Dek.

308
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:42.310
What are you doing here?

309
01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:50.630
You came back for me?

310
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.150
What exactly are you wearing?

311
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:12.390
Dek of the Yautja.

312
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800
You and I.

313
01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.420
We need to hurry.

314
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:23.160
More of them will be here any minute.

315
01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:24.161
All of them.

316
01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:31.340
What are you doing here?

317
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.340
Thanks. bud.

318
01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.460
I'm good.

319
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.700
We need to go.

320
01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040
Still. Dek?

321
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760
Alisk. I'm dead.

322
01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.640
Bud?

323
01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.240
The wing of a twin will yawn.

324
01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520
Bud's its child?

325
01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.520
What's the plan?

326
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:23.390
You have 20 minutes to initiate launch.

327
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:25.410
Let's go hunt.

328
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.490
Wait here.

329
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:39.030
You roll in there. you're not exactly
going to fit in.

330
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:42.330
I have an idea.

331
01:22:47.835 --> 01:22:49.610
I see him.

332
01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.260
On me.

333
01:23:57.170 --> 01:24:18.170
I see him.

334
01:24:18.171 --> 01:24:19.171
On me.

335
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.380
I see him.

336
01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.500
On

337
01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:46.290
me.

338
01:24:46.291 --> 01:25:25.900
You don't have to die.

339
01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.300
I'll find him.

340
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:35.830
I told you to get to the Yautja.

341
01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.440
You said to prepare the ship for takeoff
in 20 minutes.

342
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:41.930
Then what are you doing here?

343
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.570
I gave you an order!

344
01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.700
What should we do about the creature?

345
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:56.170
What creature?

346
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:03.430
You should listen to her.

347
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.420
I should listen to her?

348
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480
I don't know.

349
01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.900
We need his eyes.

350
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:49.250
We need his eyes.

351
01:26:55.590 --> 01:27:03.800
Hi. Jack.

352
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:05.180
How does it feel to be hunted?

353
01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:09.080
Tishoy. you wolf.

354
01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:55.700
This is the plan. yeah?

355
01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:41.566
We can't wait to see what's going to
happen.

356
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:42.590
We

357
01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:02.300
need you to go back.

358
01:32:02.301 --> 01:32:03.301
Are we going back?

359
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:04.820
We can't go back.

360
01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.260
What about you?

361
01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.540
I'm hungry.

362
01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:15.400
I'm so hungry.

363
01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:43.340
We need to go back.

364
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.400
Finally earned that cloak.

365
01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.760
Dek of the Yautja.

366
01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.600
More friends of yours?

367
01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440
My.

368
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:34.410
Mhlywa.
