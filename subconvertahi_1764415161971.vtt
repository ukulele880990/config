2
00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:25.465
He's out there.

3
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:27.347
Look for the muzzle flash.
Then burn the jungle.

4
00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:38.704
Base perimeter
seems to be clear.

5
00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:41.107
We'll try further out. Over.

6
00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:53.986
Percell. maintain
your intervals.

7
00:03:56.624 --> 00:03:58.458
What. you wanna
hold my hand too. Ru?

8
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.259
Three days and
a wake-up. sarge.

9
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:02.562
We're just covering
your butt.

10
00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.088
We're hit! We're hit!

11
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.856
Gordy's hit!

12
00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:37.663
He's jamming the safety!

13
00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.298
He's jamming the safety.
I can't get him off!

14
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.966
I can't get him off.
We're losing control!

15
00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.101
Mayday! Mayday!
We're coming in hard.

16
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:45.237
We're coming in hard.

17
00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:53.912
All right. I've gained control.
I'm coming down. coming down.

18
00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:00.853
Base. request medic.

19
00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:03.256
We got a copilot shot.
Request medic.

20
00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:04.790
Base. coming in.

21
00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:09.962
Roger. We have
emergency teams standing by.

22
00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:20.206
Come on. you SOB! Come on.

23
00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:42.395
Half a million GIs
in country

24
00:05:42.397 --> 00:05:44.230
and we can't spot
one lousy sniper?

25
00:05:44.232 --> 00:05:45.864
It's a big jungle.
Taylor.

26
00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:47.967
Yeah. maybe Charlie
decided to pull up stakes

27
00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.402
and move to Tan Son Nhut.

28
00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:51.937
Either way. it ain't your
problem no more. sarge.

29
00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.139
Yeah. Johnson.

30
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:55.908
You survived a full tour
and a four-month extension.

31
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.777
How's it feel coming in
from your last mission?

32
00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.513
Fat lady ain't singing yet.
Percell.

33
00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:03.882
I still got 72 hours.
38 minutes and 42 seconds.

34
00:06:05.153 --> 00:06:07.353
Yeah. but we done our three days
looking for the sniper.

35
00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:08.721
That means
it's Team Zeus's turn

36
00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:10.523
and you've saddled up
for your last time.

37
00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:12.191
That's right.

38
00:06:12.193 --> 00:06:15.194
All you gotta do is worry about
catching the big bird to Tupelo.

39
00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:17.730
You're going
home. man.

40
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:25.070
Hey. hey. what's going on?

41
00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:26.606
Come on. sarge.
don't get steamed.

42
00:06:26.608 --> 00:06:27.973
We're just watching
out for you.

43
00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:30.309
Hey. look. I don't need
a bodyguard. Percell.

44
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:31.944
You'd do the same for us.

45
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.681
Okay. I know what you guys
are trying to do.

46
00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:36.882
and I appreciate it. I do.

47
00:06:36.884 --> 00:06:38.884
But I managed to get
through most of my tour

48
00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:40.319
without you two on my tail.

49
00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:43.822
Look. if something works.
why fix it?

50
00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:45.525
See. sarge.
you gotta think of yourself

51
00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:47.160
as a finely tuned automobile.

52
00:06:47.162 --> 00:06:49.028
cruising down the main drag
of Tupelo.

53
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.829
Some guy plows into you.

54
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:52.898
You gonna tell me you're
better off without insurance?

55
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.334
See. Johnson. what he's telling
you is we are your insurance.

56
00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:56.969
Look. I don't need any.

57
00:06:56.971 --> 00:07:00.673
You just do your job.
let me do mine.

58
00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:02.175
And don't do me any favors.

59
00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:05.878
Get down! Get down!

60
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:08.747
- A sniper!
- Cover!

61
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:10.816
Clear!

62
00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:14.853
Bet you'll think twice
about that insurance.

63
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.191
Hold your fire!

64
00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:23.862
This sniper situation is getting
damn frustrating. lieutenant.

65
00:07:23.864 --> 00:07:25.431
I share the sentiment. sir.

66
00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:28.901
He shoots at our choppers
and just disappears!

67
00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:30.603
Well. sir. he doesn't
leave many signs.

68
00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:32.305
Just a few sandal prints.
nothing more.

69
00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:34.173
He tried to shoot
Lieutenant McKay's chopper

70
00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:36.342
out of the sky this morning.

71
00:07:36.344 --> 00:07:37.410
McKay all right?

72
00:07:37.412 --> 00:07:40.746
Yeah. but his copilot
wasn't so lucky.

73
00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:43.282
Lieutenant. your team's been out
for the last three days.

74
00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:45.651
When am I going
to see some results?

75
00:07:47.522 --> 00:07:49.355
That will be all.
lieutenant.

76
00:07:49.357 --> 00:07:50.456
Sir...

77
00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:52.825
I said. that will be all.
lieutenant.

78
00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:58.731
You should have told me you had
a sniper problem. colonel.

79
00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:02.635
Snipers are one
of my specialties.

80
00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:12.144
All right. so. what's everybody
drinking? It's on me.

81
00:08:12.146 --> 00:08:14.247
No. no. no.
I'm short. I'm buying.

82
00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:15.514
Beers all around.

83
00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:17.750
Okay. I guess you can
afford to be a big spender

84
00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:20.085
now that you're gonna be
a big college man.

85
00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:23.723
Hey. let's have this first sip
to sarge's last mission.

86
00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:25.691
Three days
and a wake-up.

87
00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:28.461
No. to you guys.
Thanks for everything.

88
00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:32.498
So you thought about
what you're gonna be studying

89
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.499
when you get to college?

90
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:34.767
I don't know.

91
00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:36.802
Maybe... Maybe something
to do with politics.

92
00:08:38.406 --> 00:08:41.374
No. that might work out.
He's full of bull.

93
00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:42.808
Ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.645
the President
of the United States.

95
00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:47.112
Marvin Johnson.

96
00:08:47.114 --> 00:08:49.148
Whoo! Yeah!

97
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.985
Hey. look. I got some big plans
for when I go back to the world.

98
00:08:52.987 --> 00:08:55.388
I don't think president
is one of them. though.

99
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.157
I just wanna get me
an education. you know.

100
00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:00.793
And a job.
A real good job.

101
00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:04.263
Maybe even do some work for the
movement between now and then.

102
00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:07.767
Stuff some envelopes.
answer the phone.

103
00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:09.769
Whatever I can do
to carry on Dr. King's work.

104
00:09:09.771 --> 00:09:11.271
There you go! All right.

105
00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.175
Wanna play some darts. Dan?

106
00:09:16.177 --> 00:09:18.010
Well. now.
I'm all for that.

107
00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:21.647
First one to hit Ho Chi's nose
buys the beer.

108
00:09:27.154 --> 00:09:29.755
You ain't gonna change the
system stuffing no envelopes.

109
00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:32.692
Well. we gotta start somewhere.
don't we. Taylor?

110
00:09:32.694 --> 00:09:33.826
What's wrong
with you. anyway?

111
00:09:33.828 --> 00:09:34.960
Ain't nothing wrong with me.

112
00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:36.094
Look. I figure like this:

113
00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:37.496
The more education
I get right now.

114
00:09:37.498 --> 00:09:39.097
the better chance
I've got of changing things

115
00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:40.499
when I get back
to the world.

116
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:42.100
Johnson. it's the white man
getting himself elected

117
00:09:42.102 --> 00:09:44.503
so he can send the black man
to fight the yellow man.

118
00:09:44.505 --> 00:09:45.938
I don't buy that.
That's too easy.

119
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.139
Don't think you
got it made

120
00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:48.541
because the white man
made you sergeant.

121
00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:50.343
Over here he needs you
to watch his back.

122
00:09:50.345 --> 00:09:52.144
Back home. he just
wants you to wash it.

123
00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:54.146
At least I'm trying to
do something with my life.

124
00:09:54.148 --> 00:09:55.681
instead of hiding out
in the Army.

125
00:09:55.683 --> 00:09:57.483
Who you talking about
hiding out in the Army?

126
00:09:57.485 --> 00:09:58.484
You.

127
00:09:58.486 --> 00:10:00.285
If you had something
to go back to.

128
00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:01.920
you wouldn't have re-upped
in the first place.

129
00:10:01.922 --> 00:10:03.722
Why do you keep putting
your hands on me?

130
00:10:03.724 --> 00:10:05.724
Look. at least my head
ain't full of stupid dreams.

131
00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:06.825
You know what...

132
00:10:06.827 --> 00:10:08.494
What? What are
you gonna do. huh?

133
00:10:08.496 --> 00:10:10.196
What are you
gonna do. Johnson?

134
00:10:10.198 --> 00:10:11.797
Yeah. you ought to
get that Spec-4.

135
00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.399
What are you gonna do. Johnson?
College boy!

136
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:14.800
Hey. let him go. Let him go.

137
00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:17.536
Hey. hey. hey.

138
00:10:17.538 --> 00:10:19.805
What the hell's
wrong with him. anyway?

139
00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:21.807
It don't mean nothing.

140
00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:52.604
It doesn't matter
what Taylor said.

141
00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:55.574
You're not gonna make it
anyway. Johnson.

142
00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:58.877
That sniper's got your number.

143
00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:02.981
Here on the base.
or out in the bush.

144
00:11:02.983 --> 00:11:06.952
Three days and a wake-up.

145
00:11:06.954 --> 00:11:09.054
You're a dead man.

146
00:11:22.803 --> 00:11:26.071
I'm gonna ask you
politely one more time.

147
00:11:26.073 --> 00:11:27.573
Where is Lu Bin?

148
00:11:27.574 --> 00:11:30.976
Oh. I know you know where he is
and what he looks like!

149
00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:32.978
I'll bet the two of you
eat fish heads together

150
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.979
at least once a week.

151
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:37.049
Maybe share
the same women.

152
00:11:39.453 --> 00:11:41.387
No speaky?

153
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:42.889
No speaky at all?

154
00:11:43.925 --> 00:11:45.425
Last chance!

155
00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:49.461
Lu Bin!

156
00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:55.167
Where is Lu Bin?
What does he look like?

157
00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:01.106
Okay.

158
00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:07.412
Okay!

159
00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:14.219
Don't say old Duke Fontaine
didn't warn you!

160
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.233
Good!

161
00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:29.868
But if you're lying. boy.

162
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.970
you better learn how to fly.

163
00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:36.742
Get him out of my sight!

164
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.680
By 17:30 hour.

165
00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:45.284
Exactly how dangerous is he?

166
00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:46.919
Well. he isn't
a combat soldier.

167
00:12:46.921 --> 00:12:49.054
so to the individual troop
in the field. negligible.

168
00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:52.091
But to our war effort
as a whole.

169
00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:53.225
devastating.

170
00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:54.493
Sir?

171
00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:56.728
Lu Bin is single-handedly
undermining

172
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.698
our hearts and minds program
in the Bac Lieu province.

173
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.735
He's a little ideologue
who's turned at least 40 villes.

174
00:13:03.737 --> 00:13:05.404
And what's his MO?

175
00:13:05.406 --> 00:13:08.507
Charisma and ruthless brutality.

176
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:12.378
He's. uh. almost mythical
to the peasants.

177
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.881
If a ville has any kind of
VC leaning. he wins it over.

178
00:13:15.883 --> 00:13:17.049
What if they're friendly?

179
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:19.217
You pike a few heads
in the village square.

180
00:13:19.219 --> 00:13:21.452
these dinks get religion
real fast.

181
00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:25.858
The CIA has asked for our help
to kidnap Lu Bin.

182
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.726
How will we identify him?

183
00:13:27.728 --> 00:13:30.529
Mr. Fontaine has a detailed
description of the man.

184
00:13:30.531 --> 00:13:32.530
Do you have any photos?

185
00:13:51.051 --> 00:13:53.118
That's outstanding.

186
00:14:03.798 --> 00:14:05.831
Not bad.

187
00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:08.901
John McKay.

188
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.470
I know who you are.

189
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.140
I'm Duke Fontaine.

190
00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:17.242
Yeah. well. I know who you are.

191
00:14:17.244 --> 00:14:18.777
Most chopper jocks do.

192
00:14:20.414 --> 00:14:23.415
That sniper set you down hard
yesterday. didn't he?

193
00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:25.651
Yeah. he killed my copilot.

194
00:14:26.654 --> 00:14:28.420
Got a line on his perch?

195
00:14:28.422 --> 00:14:30.088
No. he keeps moving around.

196
00:14:31.592 --> 00:14:34.493
If he settles down. try and get
a fix on what he's shooting.

197
00:14:34.495 --> 00:14:36.962
Get your ordnance people
to doctor some rounds

198
00:14:36.964 --> 00:14:38.464
and salt the area.

199
00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:43.368
Dink will always
take free ammo.

200
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.240
He chambers one of those jesses.
no more sniper.

201
00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:49.808
Sounds like a winner.

202
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.577
Well. it's my job to come up
with winners. McKay.

203
00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:54.646
And I'm good at my job.

204
00:14:54.648 --> 00:14:58.016
Besides. second place
is a body bag.

205
00:14:58.018 --> 00:14:59.885
And that's too close
and too dark for me.

206
00:14:59.887 --> 00:15:02.821
Good hunting.

207
00:15:10.364 --> 00:15:12.765
Stack 'em six high over here.
all right?

208
00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:16.234
McKay. what are you
doing up here?

209
00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:17.870
I thought we were
going to Saigon.

210
00:15:17.872 --> 00:15:20.172
This scum bucket
takes pot shots at us

211
00:15:20.174 --> 00:15:21.439
every time we're in or out.

212
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:22.507
And I'm gonna nail him.

213
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:23.909
Don't you think

214
00:15:23.911 --> 00:15:25.343
you're taking this
a little personally?

215
00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:26.712
Hell. yes.
I'm taking it personally.

216
00:15:26.714 --> 00:15:28.346
He killed my copilot.

217
00:15:28.348 --> 00:15:29.748
I want to win
the war. Goldman.

218
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.750
And if the highers
aren't gonna let us do that.

219
00:15:31.752 --> 00:15:33.318
well. then.
I want to survive.

220
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.057
You know. I'm getting tired of
snipers taking pot shots at me.

221
00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:41.326
Tired of transporting bodies
like some flying hearse.

222
00:15:41.328 --> 00:15:42.728
And I'm tired
of my heart stopping

223
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.697
every time somebody
comes up behind me.

224
00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:47.166
Well. that sounds
like you're tired.

225
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.869
Get down!

226
00:15:56.243 --> 00:15:57.842
Did you hear about
the mission tomorrow?

227
00:15:57.844 --> 00:16:01.580
Yeah. we're taking old Freefall
Fontaine out for a ride. huh?

228
00:16:01.582 --> 00:16:03.815
Yeah.

229
00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:05.917
Did he ever throw anybody
off your chopper?

230
00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:08.120
Not yet.

231
00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:09.622
What do you mean.
"Not yet"?

232
00:16:09.623 --> 00:16:11.523
You sound like
he's one of your heroes.

233
00:16:11.525 --> 00:16:13.958
Yeah. well. he fights to win.
He goes all out.

234
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.460
No pun intended.

235
00:16:16.463 --> 00:16:18.830
Well. maybe he throws a little
humanity out of the chopper

236
00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:20.565
with his prisoners.

237
00:16:21.901 --> 00:16:25.370
The important thing is.
he gets the job done.

238
00:16:27.974 --> 00:16:30.475
Come on. McKay.
That's extreme. even for you.

239
00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:33.178
Yeah. well. everything over here
seems to be a little extreme.

240
00:16:36.483 --> 00:16:37.916
And it is personal.

241
00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:39.584
Cover!

242
00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:41.153
Anybody hit?

243
00:16:46.593 --> 00:16:47.725
Hey. Hey. Johnson.

244
00:16:47.727 --> 00:16:48.961
All right. all right.

245
00:16:48.963 --> 00:16:51.496
Now. according here to
the vomit countdown. right...

246
00:16:51.498 --> 00:16:52.597
Ha. ha. You got it.

247
00:16:52.599 --> 00:16:53.698
You got eight meals left.

248
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.434
which is two
banquet breakfasts...

249
00:16:55.436 --> 00:16:57.035
Hey. sorry about that.
That's all right. doc.

250
00:16:57.037 --> 00:16:58.670
You got three lovely lunches.

251
00:16:58.672 --> 00:17:00.839
you got three super suppers.
and you're out of here!

252
00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:03.408
All right.
Company. halt!

253
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.943
LT's got a briefing.

254
00:17:04.945 --> 00:17:06.278
We got a mission tomorrow.

255
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.313
I'll check
with you later.

256
00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:10.682
Johnson.
come here a minute.

257
00:17:11.918 --> 00:17:13.285
I got some good news. Johnson.

258
00:17:13.287 --> 00:17:14.819
You're gonna sit this one out.

259
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:15.820
What?

260
00:17:15.822 --> 00:17:17.089
Yeah. LT's got it cleared.

261
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:20.725
You just gotta check in
your gear and out-process early.

262
00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:24.762
Johnson. that's
supposed to be good news.

263
00:17:24.764 --> 00:17:28.700
Yeah. I know. sarge.
But it ain't right.

264
00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:29.968
What are you talking
about. Johnson?

265
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.536
You ain't got
nothing to prove.

266
00:17:31.538 --> 00:17:34.439
Sarge. I know. But I always
go out. I'm supposed to go out.

267
00:17:34.441 --> 00:17:36.241
I don't want to hear
any of that nonsense.

268
00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:38.443
The team's gonna have to
get used to you being gone.

269
00:17:38.445 --> 00:17:40.445
and now's as good a time
to start as any.

270
00:17:40.447 --> 00:17:42.014
Sarge. I can't break
my routine now.

271
00:17:42.016 --> 00:17:44.216
I gotta do everything exactly
the way I always do it

272
00:17:44.218 --> 00:17:46.418
or. sarge. I ain't gonna make it
out of here alive.

273
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.419
That's crazy. Johnson.

274
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:48.453
No. it ain't. sarge.

275
00:17:48.455 --> 00:17:50.688
Not if you believe it.

276
00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:55.660
It's up to you. Johnson.
Up to you.

277
00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:20.752
Johnson!

278
00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:34.967
Johnson.
Aah!

279
00:18:34.969 --> 00:18:36.534
Johnson. it's okay.
It's okay.

280
00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:37.703
Calm down.

281
00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:39.404
Calm down so you
can pull back.

282
00:18:39.406 --> 00:18:41.439
Start to pull back.
It's okay.

283
00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:43.174
It's okay.

284
00:18:43.176 --> 00:18:45.143
Danny. remember Friedman?

285
00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:48.446
Always did things the same way.
day in and day out.

286
00:18:48.448 --> 00:18:52.050
Five days and a wake-up
and they let him off detail.

287
00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:54.052
He was sitting on the can
reading a magazine

288
00:18:54.054 --> 00:18:56.888
while his platoon
was out in the field. Danny.

289
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.224
Sniper blew him
all over Firebase Ladybird.

290
00:18:59.226 --> 00:19:00.659
Johnson.
that was one guy.

291
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.194
No. no. Lots of guys. Danny.
Lots of guys.

292
00:19:03.196 --> 00:19:06.565
You mess with the routine.
you're messing with fate. man.

293
00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:08.067
Listen to me.

294
00:19:08.068 --> 00:19:09.400
Johnson. now. listen to me.

295
00:19:09.402 --> 00:19:14.238
We have all missed missions.
It's no big deal.

296
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.640
Danny. this is different. man.

297
00:19:15.642 --> 00:19:17.108
I gotta stick to the routine.

298
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.978
Gotta stick to the routine.

299
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.512
You're gonna do
what you gotta do.

300
00:19:21.514 --> 00:19:23.448
Would you relax?
You're gonna be all right.

301
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.950
Just relax.

302
00:19:24.951 --> 00:19:27.285
I gotta stick
to the routine. man.

303
00:19:27.287 --> 00:19:29.354
Get some rest.

304
00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:31.489
You get some rest.

305
00:19:36.596 --> 00:19:39.431
It's too close.

306
00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:42.367
I don't want to die
in this toilet.

307
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.238
God. don't let me die
in this toilet.

308
00:19:55.682 --> 00:19:56.948
Come on. man.

309
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.950
Why don't you just run off
and marry her. Ru?

310
00:19:58.952 --> 00:20:00.418
Taylor. what
is your problem?

311
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.720
Nothing.

312
00:20:01.722 --> 00:20:03.321
Ru's acting like
that's his first skirt.

313
00:20:03.323 --> 00:20:04.489
Susanna ain't a skirt. man.

314
00:20:04.491 --> 00:20:06.123
Then you got a serious
problem. don't you?

315
00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:07.124
Yeah. you.

316
00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:08.393
Hey. knock it off.

317
00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:09.927
What's it to you. huh?

318
00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:11.763
That man's business
is his business.

319
00:20:11.765 --> 00:20:12.831
Now you mind yours.

320
00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.467
All right. everybody.
listen up now.

321
00:20:15.469 --> 00:20:18.236
This mission is a quick snatch
in a bad neighborhood.

322
00:20:18.238 --> 00:20:19.571
On top of all that.

323
00:20:19.573 --> 00:20:21.373
they're sending along a spook
to keep us company.

324
00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.775
So I don't have time for this
kind of crap. Understand me?

325
00:20:23.777 --> 00:20:26.310
So get it squared away.

326
00:20:26.312 --> 00:20:28.312
Now.

327
00:20:39.993 --> 00:20:41.993
Damn.

328
00:21:04.484 --> 00:21:08.386
Okay. goofball. Eat this.

329
00:22:34.174 --> 00:22:35.774
Hey. man.

330
00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:38.577
This way.

331
00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:39.678
It's this way. Johnson.

332
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.948
I'm in charge.
We're moving this way.

333
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:46.350
It's this way...

334
00:22:46.352 --> 00:22:47.852
sergeant.

335
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:50.088
I just gave you an order.

336
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.489
What are you gonna do.
Johnson. huh?

337
00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:53.291
You gonna turn me in?

338
00:22:53.293 --> 00:22:55.193
Ohh! Ow.

339
00:22:55.195 --> 00:22:56.861
You satisfied?
Ow!

340
00:22:56.863 --> 00:22:58.529
I'm going to write you up
for insubordination.

341
00:22:58.531 --> 00:23:00.364
Go ahead.

342
00:23:00.366 --> 00:23:02.366
I don't think it got
much of my foot. Ohh!

343
00:23:02.368 --> 00:23:04.669
Why do you always got
to be so much damn trouble?

344
00:23:04.671 --> 00:23:06.471
I thought that's what you
liked about me. Johnson.

345
00:23:06.473 --> 00:23:09.240
I don't like nothing
about you. Taylor.

346
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.092
Ohh!
Ow!

347
00:23:29.329 --> 00:23:30.495
God!

348
00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:32.930
Hey. man. Hey. You all right?

349
00:23:32.932 --> 00:23:35.734
Yeah. Oh. that little
bastard hit me hard.

350
00:23:35.736 --> 00:23:36.868
Ohh.

351
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.204
Johnson. man. I'm sorry
I got you into this.

352
00:23:40.206 --> 00:23:41.272
It wasn't your fault. man.

353
00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:42.874
Yeah. it was.

354
00:23:42.876 --> 00:23:46.378
If I hadn't been
fighting you...

355
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.179
I would have been
watching what I was doing.

356
00:23:51.685 --> 00:23:53.185
What is you
saying. huh?

357
00:23:55.321 --> 00:23:57.489
Stop that! Stop it.

358
00:24:03.229 --> 00:24:05.296
Ugh! Argh! Aargh!

359
00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:06.798
Hey!

360
00:24:11.872 --> 00:24:14.939
Hey. man. Hey.

361
00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:18.510
I don't think
he wants us to talk.

362
00:24:18.512 --> 00:24:22.680
Either that or he...
He's just cleaning his sandals.

363
00:24:44.905 --> 00:24:46.037
What have you got?

364
00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:48.139
Small outpost.
Two guards on my side.

365
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:51.208
What about Johnson and Taylor?
They left before you did.

366
00:24:52.211 --> 00:24:54.479
They'll be back.

367
00:25:00.487 --> 00:25:01.953
Anything?

368
00:25:01.955 --> 00:25:05.122
Maybe something.
Maybe nothing.

369
00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.592
"Maybe something.
maybe nothing"?

370
00:25:07.594 --> 00:25:09.694
What the hell
does that mean?

371
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.164
Just that.

372
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.350
What is your name?

373
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:34.452
Sergeant Marvin Johnson.

374
00:25:34.454 --> 00:25:38.222
RA4904862.

375
00:25:39.225 --> 00:25:43.060
Why are you here?

376
00:25:43.062 --> 00:25:45.162
Sergeant Marvin Johnson.

377
00:25:45.164 --> 00:25:46.664
RA490...

378
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.905
Why are you here?

379
00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:56.674
Sergeant Marvin Johnson.
RA49...

380
00:25:58.177 --> 00:26:01.813
That is not an ordinary Army
uniform. Sergeant Johnson.

381
00:26:01.815 --> 00:26:06.718
That is the uniform
of your elite special forces.

382
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.920
Now. why are you here?

383
00:26:10.223 --> 00:26:16.027
Sergeant Marvin Johnson.
RA49048...

384
00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:29.073
Your friend is strong.

385
00:26:29.075 --> 00:26:32.043
We will see how strong...

386
00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:35.112
and how firm your resolve.

387
00:26:57.437 --> 00:26:59.070
Be still.
you little zipperhead.

388
00:26:59.072 --> 00:27:01.906
What the hell
are you doing. Fontaine?

389
00:27:01.908 --> 00:27:03.575
I could pop that gook
from here.

390
00:27:03.577 --> 00:27:05.443
Our orders are
to take him alive.

391
00:27:05.445 --> 00:27:08.379
That's what I told your colonel
to get him to help me.

392
00:27:08.381 --> 00:27:10.247
My orders are
to terminate this guy.

393
00:27:10.249 --> 00:27:12.283
You don't give the orders
out here. I do.

394
00:27:12.285 --> 00:27:14.853
I could take over.
you know.

395
00:27:14.855 --> 00:27:16.355
Could you?

396
00:27:25.532 --> 00:27:28.533
LT. they got Johnson and Taylor
down there.

397
00:27:28.535 --> 00:27:30.035
Not for long. they don't.

398
00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:32.370
Fontaine. I've got two men

399
00:27:32.372 --> 00:27:34.105
whose lives are
at risk down there.

400
00:27:34.107 --> 00:27:35.406
That's not
my problem.

401
00:27:35.408 --> 00:27:36.908
It is now.

402
00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:43.948
We'll do it your way.

403
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.752
But you'd better pray
we get that gook.

404
00:28:02.068 --> 00:28:03.868
How many are with you?
Where are the others?

405
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.370
Marvin Johnson.
sergeant.

406
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.843
You're drowning him!

407
00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:14.211
Ah!

408
00:28:16.315 --> 00:28:18.215
Now it is your turn
to save your friend.

409
00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:21.118
How many
in your unit?

410
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.153
Where are they?

411
00:28:22.155 --> 00:28:23.688
Sergeant S-4
Marcus Taylor.

412
00:28:30.496 --> 00:28:32.931
Where are they? Where are they?
Sergeant S-4...

413
00:28:33.967 --> 00:28:35.467
Where are they?
Private Johnson...

414
00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:38.836
Sergeant...

415
00:28:42.142 --> 00:28:43.642
Where are they?

416
00:28:46.947 --> 00:28:48.447
LT.

417
00:28:50.817 --> 00:28:54.618
We'd never get
close enough.

418
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.720
Unless they start to kill them.
we wait until dark.

419
00:28:56.722 --> 00:28:58.756
then we go in.

420
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:28.019
Nobody shoots
till I give the signal.

421
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:29.020
Got it?

422
00:29:29.022 --> 00:29:31.422
I got it.

423
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.637
Just keep...
Keep fighting it. man.

424
00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:50.508
We just gotta hold on till
the... Till the guys get here.

425
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.277
You're dreaming. Marv.

426
00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.880
You got a better idea?

427
00:29:55.882 --> 00:29:58.282
Uh-uh.

428
00:29:58.284 --> 00:30:01.285
Johnson?
Yeah?

429
00:30:01.287 --> 00:30:03.354
Man. I'm sorry.
Come on. man.

430
00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:05.256
All that trash
I was talking. man.

431
00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:07.491
I didn't mean nothing
by it.

432
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.496
Oh. God!

433
00:30:14.834 --> 00:30:18.169
You ain't gotta apologize
for the way you feel. man.

434
00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:19.703
Yeah. but I ain't got
no reason.

435
00:30:19.705 --> 00:30:21.638
You got the right.

436
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.542
I ain't got no right to dump on
other people's dreams.

437
00:30:25.544 --> 00:30:28.445
Man. I don't know why
I got so mad

438
00:30:28.447 --> 00:30:31.416
every time you talked
about going to college

439
00:30:31.418 --> 00:30:34.251
and doing something
with yourself.

440
00:30:34.253 --> 00:30:37.288
but I just got mad.

441
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:41.926
I guess...
'cause you were going home.

442
00:30:43.095 --> 00:30:46.331
Guess I'm gonna
miss you too. man.

443
00:31:01.681 --> 00:31:06.784
Hope we live long enough
to miss each other.

444
00:31:08.488 --> 00:31:13.458
One of you will tell me
what I want to know.

445
00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.228
One of you will live.

446
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.997
One of you will die.

447
00:31:22.034 --> 00:31:24.902
The question is...

448
00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:26.404
which.

449
00:31:27.139 --> 00:31:29.506
You? You?

450
00:31:29.508 --> 00:31:32.243
Perhaps I should tell you

451
00:31:32.245 --> 00:31:36.313
what you have
to look forward to.

452
00:31:36.315 --> 00:31:42.687
First. a little game with fire.

453
00:31:42.689 --> 00:31:48.793
Then. I will cut
your eyes out... slowly.

454
00:31:48.795 --> 00:31:52.129
If you still will not talk.

455
00:31:52.131 --> 00:31:54.398
I will peel you...

456
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.034
like a grape.

457
00:31:57.036 --> 00:32:00.771
Even those who survive
these earlier tests

458
00:32:00.773 --> 00:32:03.541
are better off dead.

459
00:32:03.543 --> 00:32:04.542
Why don't you

460
00:32:04.544 --> 00:32:07.177
save yourselves much pain?

461
00:32:07.179 --> 00:32:08.278
Speak to me now!

462
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.180
Why don't you stick it...

463
00:32:43.716 --> 00:32:45.883
All right. we'll go in
with two teams.

464
00:32:45.885 --> 00:32:47.317
You go in first. sergeant.

465
00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:49.020
You flank left
and take Percell with you.

466
00:32:49.022 --> 00:32:50.120
Percell.

467
00:32:50.122 --> 00:32:52.089
give doc the radio.

468
00:32:52.091 --> 00:32:53.558
Doc. you stay with Ru.

469
00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.359
Ru. you set that pig up.

470
00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:57.562
If we get into any trouble.
you make it squeal.

471
00:32:57.564 --> 00:33:00.965
Fontaine. you stick with me.

472
00:33:00.967 --> 00:33:03.267
Let's do it.

473
00:33:12.712 --> 00:33:15.012
Doc. you want
to feed ammo?

474
00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.814
Feed what?

475
00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:19.016
Forget it. doc.

476
00:33:28.995 --> 00:33:32.162
Think about
what is ahead for you.

477
00:33:32.164 --> 00:33:36.400
We will see how courageous
you feel in the morning.

478
00:34:01.026 --> 00:34:02.759
There's our boy.

479
00:34:05.531 --> 00:34:07.031
Fontaine!

480
00:34:17.276 --> 00:34:21.278
Something's gone wrong.
Let's go.

481
00:34:37.396 --> 00:34:39.663
It's catching on fire.
Johnson.

482
00:34:39.665 --> 00:34:41.165
We've gotta get loose.

483
00:34:42.068 --> 00:34:43.901
Keep working on it.
Pull it.

484
00:34:46.605 --> 00:34:48.940
- Work at it.
- It's gotta be...

485
00:34:50.576 --> 00:34:53.777
Keep working on it.
Just keep working on it.

486
00:35:01.387 --> 00:35:02.887
Keep working!
Damn it. come on!

487
00:35:16.602 --> 00:35:19.102
Go. go. go. go!

488
00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:27.310
Percell.
pop that flare.

489
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.728
Johnson! Keep working it!
Keep working it!

490
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.764
He's getting up. Johnson!
He's getting up!

491
00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:47.765
Keep working it!

492
00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:50.501
I'll cover you. You go.

493
00:35:50.503 --> 00:35:52.003
Go. go. go!

494
00:36:15.895 --> 00:36:17.261
I'm going in.
Cover me.

495
00:36:17.263 --> 00:36:18.763
All right. go!

496
00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:28.973
Sarge!
Sarge. cut us loose!

497
00:36:28.975 --> 00:36:30.174
Cut me off this rope!

498
00:36:30.176 --> 00:36:33.878
Go. go. go. go. go. go. go!

499
00:36:39.252 --> 00:36:40.784
Hey. you guys all right?

500
00:36:40.786 --> 00:36:44.288
Other than damn near barbecuing.
doc. I'm fine.

501
00:36:52.464 --> 00:36:55.332
Sergeant. let's get
the hell out of here.

502
00:36:57.636 --> 00:37:00.304
Let's go. let's go. let's go!

503
00:37:08.114 --> 00:37:10.614
Damn! He was the wrong guy.

504
00:37:10.616 --> 00:37:13.951
He wasn't even Lu Bin.
Some lousy VC lieutenant.

505
00:37:13.953 --> 00:37:16.787
You cannot trust
these gooks.

506
00:37:16.789 --> 00:37:19.089
Should've airmailed
that sucker in the chopper.

507
00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:20.958
Shut up. Fontaine.

508
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.559
That's affirmative.
Goldilocks.

509
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:23.560
We got a visual.

510
00:37:23.562 --> 00:37:25.695
We're popping smoke.

511
00:37:28.734 --> 00:37:32.202
All right. let's clear back
or it'll land on our heads.

512
00:37:51.357 --> 00:37:54.992
I still have to find
this Lu Bin character.

513
00:37:54.994 --> 00:37:56.860
Since you know the assignment.

514
00:37:56.862 --> 00:37:59.363
I'm gonna request your team.

515
00:37:59.365 --> 00:38:01.198
Not a chance.

516
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.766
You lied to me.

517
00:38:02.768 --> 00:38:04.368
And you risked the lives
of my men

518
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.303
on some wild-goose chase
you had.

519
00:38:06.305 --> 00:38:08.905
Two of my boys
almost got roasted. buddy...

520
00:38:08.907 --> 00:38:10.674
because of you.

521
00:38:10.676 --> 00:38:12.009
It was a mistake.

522
00:38:12.011 --> 00:38:13.777
It was unnecessary.

523
00:38:13.779 --> 00:38:16.180
The guy I was questioning
was lying to me.

524
00:38:16.182 --> 00:38:17.714
What was I supposed to do?

525
00:38:17.716 --> 00:38:18.848
I'd have lied too

526
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.119
if I thought I had to walk home
from 2000 feet.

527
00:38:24.423 --> 00:38:27.257
How would you like to earn
your nickname. Freefall?

528
00:38:27.259 --> 00:38:28.992
Huh?

529
00:38:28.994 --> 00:38:30.927
Go ahead.

530
00:38:30.929 --> 00:38:33.130
But I don't think
you got the hair for it.

531
00:38:33.132 --> 00:38:34.632
Sergeant!

532
00:38:36.969 --> 00:38:38.668
He ain't worth it.

533
00:38:41.107 --> 00:38:42.339
You're right. LT.

534
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:44.441
I'd be doing him a favor.

535
00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:48.044
And there ain't no way
I'm gonna do that.

536
00:38:50.749 --> 00:38:53.217
Whoo-hoo!

537
00:39:20.045 --> 00:39:21.378
Whoa!

538
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.414
All right. that's enough.
damn it.

539
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.485
Hey. hey.
LT. take it easy.

540
00:39:28.487 --> 00:39:30.754
Hose it down. Smitty.
I want that sucker.

541
00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:35.992
Hey. put us down. LT.
then go after him.

542
00:39:35.994 --> 00:39:37.528
Yeah. put us down. LT.

543
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.262
Come on. LT.
We've gotta take this.

544
00:39:39.264 --> 00:39:41.264
Yeah. okay. don't get
your underwear in a bundle.

545
00:39:41.266 --> 00:39:42.433
We're going in.

546
00:39:42.435 --> 00:39:43.667
- All right.
- Move.

547
00:39:43.669 --> 00:39:47.638
Yeah! Come on. Whoo!

548
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.911
Oh. this feels so good!

549
00:40:02.955 --> 00:40:04.488
So you got
all your stuff?

550
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.956
Packed and ready.

551
00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:08.692
It's gotta be the happiest day
of your life. Johnson.

552
00:40:08.694 --> 00:40:10.261
Yeah. it is.
It is.

553
00:40:10.263 --> 00:40:12.029
It's a sad one too.
though.

554
00:40:12.031 --> 00:40:15.032
I mean. if I live
to be 100 years old.

555
00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:16.367
I don't think
I'll ever experience

556
00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:19.370
anything as intense
as all this.

557
00:40:19.372 --> 00:40:22.606
I mean. it's just so.
you know. intense.

558
00:40:22.608 --> 00:40:25.209
Intense and crazy.

559
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:28.111
I mean. one night we're out
looking for Victor Charles.

560
00:40:28.113 --> 00:40:31.148
He tries to kill us.
we try to kill him.

561
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.349
And the next night

562
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:34.652
we sit around. drink beer
and talk about it.

563
00:40:34.654 --> 00:40:36.487
I bet you they're doing
the same thing.

564
00:40:36.489 --> 00:40:39.490
You know? Sitting around.
talking about it.

565
00:40:39.492 --> 00:40:41.992
I mean. nobody
except the guys that are here

566
00:40:41.994 --> 00:40:43.927
could know how it was.

567
00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:46.029
And nobody gonna know
what I'm talking about.

568
00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:48.532
You ain't gonna find many people
willing to listen either.

569
00:40:48.534 --> 00:40:50.133
If you do. they won't care
about you.

570
00:40:50.135 --> 00:40:52.603
Cut it out. Percell.
You're becoming a cynic.

571
00:40:52.605 --> 00:40:54.572
And this is supposed to be
a celebration!

572
00:40:54.574 --> 00:40:56.074
Hey. yeah. that's right.
All right!

573
00:40:56.075 --> 00:40:57.708
To no more humping
the boonies!

574
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.910
All right. no more humping
the boonies.

575
00:40:59.912 --> 00:41:02.012
and no more laying awake
in the hooch all night

576
00:41:02.014 --> 00:41:04.281
listening to Percell
snore like a chain saw.

577
00:41:05.585 --> 00:41:08.952
And no more reaching into
your pocket for your wallet

578
00:41:08.954 --> 00:41:10.454
and shaking hands with Taylor!

579
00:41:11.957 --> 00:41:13.257
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

580
00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:15.659
And no more having to listen
to Ru bitch about the chow

581
00:41:15.661 --> 00:41:17.294
and then brag about his women.

582
00:41:17.296 --> 00:41:20.231
and then bitch about the bunk
and then brag about his women.

583
00:41:20.233 --> 00:41:23.100
All right. all right.
You've made your point.

584
00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:27.438
When you get back there.
you tell your mom and everybody

585
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.540
that all of us here
think her boy Marvin

586
00:41:29.542 --> 00:41:31.141
is one hell
of a fine human being.

587
00:41:31.143 --> 00:41:32.443
Oh. yeah.

588
00:41:32.445 --> 00:41:34.278
Can't help but drink to that.

589
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.446
Oh. yeah.
Drink to that.

590
00:41:35.448 --> 00:41:37.648
Let's drink. Amen.

591
00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.651
You're the best damn friend
I ever had.

592
00:41:40.653 --> 00:41:42.419
I'm really sorry. man.

593
00:41:42.421 --> 00:41:43.887
Hey. forget it.

594
00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:46.022
I can't forget it.
I almost got us killed.

595
00:41:46.024 --> 00:41:48.225
I just hope
you can forget it.

596
00:41:48.227 --> 00:41:49.860
Forget what?

597
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.033
Now. that ups it
for us.

598
00:41:57.035 --> 00:41:58.802
That was just like
I showed you guys.

599
00:41:58.804 --> 00:42:00.003
That was good.

600
00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:01.405
That was good.
I thought you'd forgotten.

601
00:42:01.407 --> 00:42:02.439
To Marvin. man.

602
00:42:02.441 --> 00:42:03.941
To Marvin.

603
00:42:10.283 --> 00:42:12.082
You keep your eyes open.
Smitty.

604
00:42:12.084 --> 00:42:15.252
If that guy don't shoot us.
we get him.

605
00:42:21.093 --> 00:42:22.760
Sarge. I'm scared.

606
00:42:22.762 --> 00:42:25.162
Johnson.
scared of what?

607
00:42:25.164 --> 00:42:29.132
You just survived a full tour
and four months in country here.

608
00:42:29.134 --> 00:42:31.134
you're about to get
on a chopper and go home.

609
00:42:31.136 --> 00:42:32.135
What are you scared of?

610
00:42:32.137 --> 00:42:34.605
Sarge. when I came here.

611
00:42:34.607 --> 00:42:36.139
I was just a kid. you know?

612
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:38.141
I mean. I'd been in the Army
for a while

613
00:42:38.143 --> 00:42:41.278
but I was still a kid.

614
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.347
And they gave me a weapon
and live ammunition

615
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:47.384
and told me I had to come over
here and start killing people.

616
00:42:47.386 --> 00:42:51.622
Sergeant. what I'm trying to say
is I'm grown up now

617
00:42:51.624 --> 00:42:54.425
and I don't know what it's going
to be like back in the world.

618
00:42:54.427 --> 00:42:56.460
Well. you're right
about one thing. Johnson.

619
00:42:56.462 --> 00:42:58.629
You're not a kid anymore.
you're a man.

620
00:42:58.631 --> 00:43:00.230
And you're a good man.

621
00:43:00.232 --> 00:43:02.966
You're decent and you're strong.

622
00:43:02.968 --> 00:43:05.536
and if you don't mind
my saying so. I'm proud of you.

623
00:43:05.538 --> 00:43:08.205
You know. of all the things
that happened to you over here.

624
00:43:08.207 --> 00:43:10.006
you didn't let any of it
turn you away

625
00:43:10.008 --> 00:43:11.208
from what you came over here

626
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.311
believing about good.
and right and wrong.

627
00:43:14.313 --> 00:43:18.682
Whatever you decide to do.
I know you'll do a good job.

628
00:43:18.684 --> 00:43:21.051
Thanks. sarge.

629
00:43:24.122 --> 00:43:26.256
Now get out of here.

630
00:43:28.193 --> 00:43:29.993
Hey. sarge. I just thought
about something.

631
00:43:29.995 --> 00:43:31.995
This is the last time
in my life

632
00:43:31.997 --> 00:43:33.997
I'm ever gonna have to
take an order from you.

633
00:43:33.999 --> 00:43:37.801
Johnson. get on that chopper.
Now!

634
00:43:37.803 --> 00:43:40.070
Get out of Vietnam.
That's a direct order. Now go.

635
00:43:40.072 --> 00:43:41.372
Go. go.
Move. move. move.

636
00:43:41.374 --> 00:43:44.475
Johnson.
Yes. sarge?

637
00:43:44.477 --> 00:43:48.245
Keep your head down.

638
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:03.460
Clear!

639
00:44:03.462 --> 00:44:04.495
All right.

640
00:44:04.497 --> 00:44:06.864
All right.

641
00:44:06.866 --> 00:44:08.366
Get out of here.
