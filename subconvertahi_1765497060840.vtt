<i>Five million dollars

<i>I. Slater King.</i>

10
00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.122
<i>I have sought therapy.</i>

11
00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:02.851

13
00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:17.752
<i>Slater King.</i>

14
00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.085
<i>thank you
for joining us tonight.</i>

15
00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:22.115
<i>Let's
get to the question</i>

16
00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.347
<i>that everybody is dying
for you to answer.</i>

17
00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:26.548
<i>Where have you been
since you stepped down</i>

18
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:30.583
<i>and made your CFO Vic Mahoney
CEO of King-Tech?</i>

19
00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:32.032
<i>After everything
that happened.</i>

20
00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:33.851
<i>um... I just realized</i>

21
00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.992
<i>that sometimes
you really do have to just</i>

22
00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:37.590
<i>stop and smell the flowers.</i>

23
00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:41.664
<i>So. uh. I sort of
bought an island.</i>

24
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.025
<i>An island?</i>

25
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.334
<i>No phones. no work.
We grow our own food.</i>

26
00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.970
<i>I wear the same thing
every day.</i>

27
00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:48.336
<i>I have chickens.</i>

28
00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.166
<i>- Chickens?
- Yeah. I have chickens.</i>

29
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:52.775
<i>Seems like
you really are a changed man.</i>

30
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.874
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

31
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.447
<i>So. last year you started
the King-Tech Foundation.</i>

32
00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:01.077
<i>What do you have
to say to the critics</i>

33
00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.421
<i>who call your recent
philanthropy performative?</i>

34
00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:06.819
<i>Look.
I'm just trying to do better.</i>

35
00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.892
<i>I don't know how else
to say that I'm sorry.</i>

36
00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:11.360
<i>'Cause I am sorry.</i>

37
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.597
<i>I really am.
I am... I'm sorry.</i>

38
00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.594
<i>But I've... I've said
those words so many times</i>

39
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.428
<i>that they've lost meaning.</i>

40
00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:22.550
<i>Do you expect
people to forgive and forget?</i>

41
00:03:22.574 --> 00:03:24.334
<i>I don't expect
anything from anyone.</i>

42
00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:25.908
<i>It's not the reality
that we live in.</i>

43
00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:28.855
Hey. dude.
you got my lighter?

44
00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.474
Oh. Sorry.

45
00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.741
Hey. do you have the money?

46
00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.077
The super's
gonna be here soon.

47
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.482
Right. About that...

48
00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:36.538
- Oh. what did you do?
- It's a surprise for you.

49
00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.288
- Oh. boy.
- I love you.

50
00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:40.455
Wait. Do we have any...

51
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:44.921
Thanks.

52
00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:02.339
I need
a fucking vacation.

- Hmm.
- You're late.

59
00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:29.304
Oh. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.271
I missed
the bus and...

61
00:04:31.406 --> 00:04:32.538
This is the King-Tech gala.

62
00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:34.270
the most important event
of the year.

63
00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:35.983
Can we just have a quick talk
about your behavior last year?

64
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:37.640
- It was a little chatty. so...
- No.

65
00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:40.016
No. no. no. He talked to me.

66
00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:41.228
He told me he liked my nails.

67
00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.252
- That's it.
- Anyway...

68
00:04:42.352 --> 00:04:43.683
I just want. this time around.

69
00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.883
you to be a little bit
more invisible. okay?

70
00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:49.557
Okay.

71
00:04:49.693 --> 00:04:51.436
- Okay? Can you do that?
- Yes. I can do that.

72
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.855
- Okay.
- I can.

73
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.057
- And don't forget to smile.
- I won't.

74
00:04:58.102 --> 00:04:59.402
I missed my audition

75
00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:00.675
waiting for the super
who never showed up.

76
00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:01.864
So we still have black mold

77
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.440
and I guess
we're just gonna die now.

78
00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:04.744
Yo. Jess.
can I get your lighter?

79
00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:06.642
Yes. But I want it back.

80
00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:08.688
I'm gonna have to write
my goddamn name on that thing.

81
00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:10.741
This haircut is so stupid.
Do I look like a boy?

82
00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:13.582
A very cute boy.

83
00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:16.419
I heard you sneaking out
last night at. like. 3:00 a.m.

84
00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:18.783
Where'd you go?

85
00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.389
- Heh.
- What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:23.052
- Don't be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

87
00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:25.890
I just can't magically
erase shit from my brain.

88
00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:29.665
So. when you
get back together.

89
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.234
don't expect me to pretend
like I don't want to stab him.

90
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.202
- It's complicated.
- It's not.

91
00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:35.898
Stop giving away your power.

92
00:05:36.034 --> 00:05:37.314
You're not a human
phone charger.

93
00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:38.903
Just have some self-respect.

94
00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:43.914
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:46.141
I love you.

96
00:05:46.277 --> 00:05:48.880
I just don't understand
why you keep going back.

97
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.716
I guess I'm just scared
of being alone.

98
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:55.418
Aw. You're not alone.
You have me.

99
00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:56.553
Mmm. Yeah.

100
00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.795
Don't forget to smile. ladies.

101
00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:01.862
<i>All right.</i>

102
00:06:01.997 --> 00:06:04.965
<i>Okay. Okay. okay.
let's get serious. people.</i>

103
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.834
<i>We want to thank you all
for being here with us tonight</i>

104
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.967
<i>so that the King Foundation
can get on</i>

105
00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:12.074
<i>with the business
of doing good</i>

106
00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:13.509

107
00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:15.072
<i>I want to give
a round of applause</i>

108

Oh. my God! Oh. my God.

112
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:23.961
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- ...Mr. Slater King.</i>

113
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.789
Careful.

114
00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:32.755
You're gonna sprain your neck.

115
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.563
I don't care if I break it.

116
00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:38.660
Ready
for your surprise?

117
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:39.997
Oh. boy.

118
00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.503
- Red or blue?
- Uh...

119
00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:50.346
This is crazy.

120
00:06:50.482 --> 00:06:51.689
I know. right?

121
00:06:51.713 --> 00:06:53.021
No.
it's. like. crazy-crazy.

122
00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.511
We just can't really
afford to...

123
00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.151
Jess. don't do that.

124
00:06:56.286 --> 00:06:57.986
No. Whose time is it?

125
00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.121
Our time.

126
00:06:59.183 --> 00:07:00.588
You know what my mom
used to say?

127
00:07:00.723 --> 00:07:04.556
- Hmm?
- Success is the best revenge.

128
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:05.890
You think he'll remember me?

129
00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.441
Who could forget you?

130
00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:08.506
You know?

131
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.859
- Oh. shit!
- You okay?

132
00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:12.095
Sorry.
Yeah. I just.

133
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.742
I don't know how to walk
in these fucking things.

134
00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:14.809
Okay. do this thing my aunt

135
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:15.833
- taught me. okay?
- Okay.

136
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.307
East. west. east. west.

137
00:07:19.443 --> 00:07:22.071
East. west. east. west.

138
00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:24.811
- East. west. east. west.
- Hello.

139
00:07:24.947 --> 00:07:28.650
East. east. West. east.
west. east. west...

140
00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:30.585
Oh. shit.
It's Jennifer. Fuck.

141
00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:36.891
Oh. hold up.

142
00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:38.935
I think it's because
people like me would touch it.

143
00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.032
So it's smarter
for them to do that.

144
00:07:40.056 --> 00:07:41.397
I wouldn't want to ruin it.

145
00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:42.894
Ladies.
this is a private area.

146
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.629
Could I have you step
that way. please?

147
00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:46.294
- Oh. okay.
- Yeah. sure.

148
00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:48.109
- Hey. Stan.
- Hey. Cody. how are you doin'?

149
00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:51.634
- Good.
- South. south. south.

150
00:07:55.813 --> 00:07:58.377
Hey. how much you think
that little head costs?

151
00:07:58.513 --> 00:08:00.748
Like. a million dollars?

152
00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:04.382
I wonder if that alarm would
go off if you stole...

153
00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:06.317
Frida. Frida.

154
00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:07.656
Frida?

155
00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.997
Shit.

156
00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:22.165
Are you all right?

157
00:08:28.277 --> 00:08:29.374
Here. may I?

158
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.844
Yeah.

159
00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:35.849
Saw it in a movie once.

160
00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:37.592
and I've always
wanted to do it.

161
00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:38.819
Now you're even.

162
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.290
Slater.

163
00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:43.758
- Rich!
- Hey.

164
00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:45.199
the speech turned out great.

165
00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:46.783
Really? Are you sure?
I mean...

166
00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:48.067
How did it feel to be...

167
00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.376
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- ...just scared

168
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.530
- to say anything.
- Yes?

169
00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:51.931
I know. I know.

170
00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:53.439
- I totally understand.
- Your hand.

171
00:08:53.463 --> 00:08:54.983
I was very proud of you.
Listen.

172
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.299
- you've come a long way.
- Oh.

173
00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:58.906
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.680
Listen. I'm...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

175
00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:02.904
No. no. You're not
interrupting. This is. um...

176
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:05.976

179
00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:12.587
Yeah.

180
00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:15.087
Uh. Frida.
this is Dr. Rich Stein.

181
00:09:15.223 --> 00:09:18.155
Um. he's...
He's actually my therapist.

182
00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:20.562
- Oh.

183
00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:21.902
I'm just kidding.

184
00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:22.926
Very nice to meet you.

185
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:24.259
Blink twice if I'm in danger.

186
00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:25.914
- Oh. dear.
- Well. maybe not.

187
00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.296
Let's not answer
that one. right?

188
00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:30.110
Well.
I'll let you get back to it.

213
00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:13.355

You got all that?
It's a bit of a whirlwind.

Do I know you from somewhere?

227
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.746
- Seen you somewhere? No?
- No. I don't think so.

228
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.335

240
00:11:29.553 --> 00:11:31.759
I forgot you own
your own island.

241
00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:33.763
It's casual.

242
00:11:34.496 --> 00:11:36.159
So casual. Yeah.

243
00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:37.932

- Can we go?
- I gotta go.

247
00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:45.378
I need to be in a place
where I can get

248
00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:46.941
- an umbrella in my drink.
- Yeah.

249

Did you see that?

252
00:11:59.054 --> 00:12:01.485
He was like...

253
00:12:02.992 --> 00:12:05.288
Another chapter

254
00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:07.289
- Yeah. totally.

255
00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:08.745
Of course I fucking didn't.
How...

256
00:12:08.797 --> 00:12:10.096
What are you talking about?

257
00:12:10.231 --> 00:12:11.876
- How does a dude like that...?
- After all that?

258
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.107
I don't know.

259
00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:15.436

Okay.

337
00:17:15.733 --> 00:17:17.238
So do you think
the human sacrifice

338
00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:20.470

339
00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.771

You look so good.

342
00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:32.198

00:17:32.222 --> 00:17:33.462
I don't know.
It's cute.

344
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.660
How'd they know
our bra size?

345
00:17:34.684 --> 00:17:36.024
They're probably gonna

346
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.200
be dressed exactly
the same too.

I'm learning a lot.

355
00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:58.343
But eventually. I wanna do

356
00:17:58.478 --> 00:17:59.786
my own thing. you know?

357
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.250
I wanna be the Slater King
of crypto.

358
00:18:01.317 --> 00:18:02.112
Hey. Vic.
you want some watermelon?

359
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.381
Thank you.

362
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.023
What? What do you mean
it's a little chewy?

363
00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:10.399
Why do you always
gotta do that?

Two eyes.

367
00:18:22.939 --> 00:18:24.432
three little buttons.

368
00:18:24.567 --> 00:18:26.170

00:18:51.062 --> 00:18:54.000
Oh. I knew it. You were
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes.</i>

378
00:18:54.135 --> 00:18:55.602
Eight seasons.

379
00:18:55.737 --> 00:18:58.537
Yo. you went cuckoo for
Cocoa Puffs on that show.

380
00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.539
Well.
they edit a lot of shit out.

381
00:19:02.378 --> 00:19:04.246

to do to survive.

388
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440
Frida. you okay?

389
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.249

Hmm.

Desideria.

394
00:20:02.171 --> 00:20:03.932
It actually only grows here.

395
00:20:04.067 --> 00:20:06.007
- Oh.
- We got a beautiful

396
00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:08.438
little herb garden over here.

397
00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:10.906
Got our chickens.

398
00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:14.282
You know.

399
00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:16.780
it's not what I thought
it was gonna be.

400
00:20:17.888 --> 00:20:18.946
What do you mean?

401
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:21.549
The legendary parties
of Slater King

402
00:20:21.685 --> 00:20:24.190
with drugs and debauchery.

403
00:20:24.326 --> 00:20:25.401
We still do drugs.

404
00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.129
We just do them
with intention.

405
00:20:30.264 --> 00:20:31.694
And we still have fun.

406
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.829
It's just a little
different now.

407
00:20:33.964 --> 00:20:36.364
Therapy changed my life.

408
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.100
Thanks. guys.

409
00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:41.541
Yeah. we have a bit of
a pest problem at the moment.

410
00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:43.471
It's a lash viper.

411
00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:46.047
I feel bad killing them.

412
00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:47.910
but they're kind of a problem.

413
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:50.279
Are you in therapy?

414
00:20:50.414 --> 00:20:51.783
Oh. no. No.

415
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.783
I think therapy is kind of
self-indulgent bullshit.

416
00:20:54.918 --> 00:20:56.787
You sound exactly
like my sister.

417
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.762
Why should I pay to tell
someone about the time

418
00:20:58.793 --> 00:21:00.991
my mom tried to kill herself
in front of me?

419
00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.430
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:05.095
It's fine. I survived.
I'm still here.

421
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.434
Yeah.

422
00:21:07.804 --> 00:21:10.534
But I agree with you on
the whole talk therapy thing.

423
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.967
That's not really
what I'm into.

424
00:21:12.102 --> 00:21:14.904
Rich is more of. like.
a trauma therapist.

425
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:18.479
Uh. you know. specializes
in repressed memory.

426
00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:21.481
What can't you remember?

427
00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:25.117
Uh. pretty much
anything before 10.

428
00:21:25.253 --> 00:21:26.914
So I imagine it was

429
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:29.586
probably pretty bad?

430
00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:31.827
Why would you
want to remember?

431
00:21:31.962 --> 00:21:33.329
I'd pay to forget.

432
00:21:34.196 --> 00:21:35.426
Maybe you're right.

433
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.231
Maybe forgetting is a gift.

434
00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:38.926
- Oh. God.
- Oh. shit.

435
00:21:39.062 --> 00:21:40.333
Don't even bother.
She's got it.

436
00:21:40.468 --> 00:21:41.575
- No. no.
- Let me help you.

437
00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:43.032
No. no. no. I got it.

438
00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:44.645
She's physically
incapable of accepting help.

439
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:47.068
Relax. you're on vacation.

440
00:21:48.209 --> 00:21:49.805
Oh. Slater. uh.

441
00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:52.245
I had them put the chair
in the new spot.

442
00:21:52.381 --> 00:21:53.609
- Okay.
- So let me know

443
00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.349
if it seems less weird there.

444
00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:57.151
- Okay.
- I think it looks nice.

445
00:21:57.287 --> 00:21:59.685
Uh. also. um. the vape liquid.

446
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.026
- I put in your desk.
- All right.

447
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.653
- And one more.
- Yeah?

448
00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:04.619
The new generator
is not working.

449
00:22:04.754 --> 00:22:06.054
So I had all the candles.

450
00:22:06.189 --> 00:22:07.735
uh. laid out in the...
in the dining room.

451
00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:08.759
- Okay.
- Okay?

452
00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:10.531
Appreciate you. I love you.

453
00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:13.435
I love you too.

454
00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:18.968
Oh. my God.

455
00:22:19.103 --> 00:22:23.109
I haven't
seen you in years.

456
00:22:23.244 --> 00:22:24.980
It's been decades.

457
00:22:25.116 --> 00:22:26.281
Do you come here often?

458
00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:28.380
- Oh. all the time.
- Oh. of course.

459
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.045
This is where I reside now.

460
00:22:30.987 --> 00:22:32.218
This is my home.

461
00:22:32.354 --> 00:22:34.182
East. west. east...

462
00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:37.559
Friends. tonight
we have zucchini blossoms.

463
00:22:37.695 --> 00:22:41.494
fresh from the organic garden
right here at Chez King.

464
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.624
We have a yuca
mofongo croquetas.

465
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.060
which is deep-fried. uh.

466
00:22:45.195 --> 00:22:46.932
which is a little bit
naughty.

467
00:22:47.068 --> 00:22:50.465
And. of course. we have this
beautifully dry-aged steak.

468
00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:52.003
Blessings. Enjoy.

469
00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:53.442
Oh. Wow.

470
00:22:53.577 --> 00:22:55.838
Everybody raise your glasses
for Camilla here.

471
00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.712
- No. don't do that.
- Yep.

472
00:22:57.848 --> 00:23:00.115
She just finalized the sale
of her app as of yesterday.

473
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.779
Welcome to King-Tech. girl.

474
00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:04.119
Thank you. Thanks. guys.

475
00:23:04.255 --> 00:23:05.553
What's it... How does it work?

476
00:23:05.688 --> 00:23:07.681
It's an astrology thing.
It's called The Cycle.

477
00:23:07.817 --> 00:23:09.084
Dude. it's awesome.

478
00:23:09.219 --> 00:23:11.426
You put in your birth time
and location.

479
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:12.935
- Mmm-hmm.
- And it tells you

480
00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:14.925
that the reason that
your sitcom got canceled

481
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.826
and your wife is sucking
the neighbor's dick

482
00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.893
while you're eating eggs
to slim down

483
00:23:19.028 --> 00:23:21.301
so that somebody
will fuck you...

484
00:23:21.436 --> 00:23:22.635
...is because

485
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.002
the planet Saturn
is trying to teach you

486
00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.938
how to process your emotions
in a healthier way.

487
00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.880
I'm glad
you're finding it helpful.

488
00:23:32.016 --> 00:23:33.016
It's awesome.

489
00:23:34.214 --> 00:23:35.484
Buddy.

490
00:23:35.619 --> 00:23:37.745
Ah. I just love cooking
for my friends.

491
00:23:37.881 --> 00:23:39.149
It just hits different.

492
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:40.817
Looks beautiful. Cody.

493
00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:42.617
Yeah.
dig into the steak. guys.

494
00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:44.490
- Mmm.
- Dude.

495
00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.126
- Can I have some salt?
- Really?

496
00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:48.222
Yeah. It needs it.

497
00:23:48.357 --> 00:23:50.037
- You want one?
- No. I don't eat red meat.

498
00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:53.030
- Oh. Sorry.
- This place is insane.

499
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.543
- So pretty.
- Give me the pepper too.

500
00:23:54.567 --> 00:23:55.800
Fuck you. Vic.

501
00:23:55.936 --> 00:23:57.242
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

502
00:23:57.266 --> 00:23:59.536
I'm glad you're having
a good... Ooh.

503
00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:01.136
You got. like. a little...

504
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.442
Uh-oh!

505
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:05.941
Kool-Aid on the cult robe.

506
00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:07.979
- Oh.
- Oopsie-daisy.

507
00:24:08.114 --> 00:24:09.914
Don't worry about it.
It's fine. You're good.

508
00:24:14.892 --> 00:24:17.719
So. uh. Sarah. are...
are you gonna be on <i>All-Stars?</i>

509
00:24:17.854 --> 00:24:19.495
I was gonna be. yeah.

510
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.527
But. after 22 years.
they've just decided

511
00:24:22.663 --> 00:24:24.630
a show about girls in bikinis

512
00:24:24.766 --> 00:24:26.367
fighting for their lives
in the jungle

513
00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:27.742
is exploitative.

514
00:24:27.835 --> 00:24:29.443
- And I'm. like...
- Smell that. babe.

515
00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:30.703
Wow.

516
00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:34.242
Yeah. so two years
of training for nothing.

517
00:24:34.378 --> 00:24:35.575
I'm sure it'll come in handy.

518
00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:41.882
Oh. that's gonna
open up beautifully.

519
00:24:42.017 --> 00:24:44.850
So. uh. Frida. when you're
not staining your clothes.

520
00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.952
what else do you do?

521
00:24:47.088 --> 00:24:51.322
Um... Well.
I'm just... I'm just trying

522
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:52.820
to figure it out.

523
00:24:52.955 --> 00:24:54.424
Figuring it out. huh?

524
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560
Yeah.

525
00:24:55.629 --> 00:24:57.092
Let me know how that goes.

526
00:24:57.227 --> 00:24:58.798
Yeah. I guess
I just. you know.

527
00:24:58.933 --> 00:25:00.273
don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

528
00:25:00.297 --> 00:25:02.163
You know. Vic here
has a Harvard degree

529
00:25:02.298 --> 00:25:03.997
in not knowing
what the fuck he's doing.

530
00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:05.666
Ask him how he lost his pinky.

531
00:25:05.802 --> 00:25:07.170
Yeah.

532
00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:10.577
No. What's the big deal?
I'm just asking questions.

533
00:25:10.713 --> 00:25:12.447
I like our new friend
Frida here.

534
00:25:12.582 --> 00:25:14.012
I think she's cool
and interesting.

535
00:25:14.148 --> 00:25:15.459
I just want to get to know
her better. that's all.

536
00:25:15.483 --> 00:25:17.113
All right.

537
00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:19.885
Hey. hey. hey!
Sip it. dude. Sip it.

538
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.217
The wine's older than you.

539
00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:25.253
Yeah. s... sorry.

540
00:25:27.796 --> 00:25:30.665
Offerings.
Time for the real dessert.

541
00:25:32.362 --> 00:25:35.801
These beautiful psilocybin
and MDMA droppies

542
00:25:35.936 --> 00:25:38.306
will introduce you
to your ancestors.

543
00:25:38.441 --> 00:25:39.606
Yeah.

544
00:25:39.742 --> 00:25:41.236
Blessings.
children of the forest.

545
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:43.744
Who's first?

546
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.944
Uh...

547
00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:47.445
How many do I do?

548
00:25:47.581 --> 00:25:49.143
Come here.

549
00:25:49.278 --> 00:25:52.346
He's the master.

550
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.219
Uh-uh. Set your intention.

551
00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:06.030
One.

552
00:26:07.169 --> 00:26:08.169
Two.

553
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:09.731
Three.

554
00:26:09.867 --> 00:26:11.436
I love you so much.

555
00:26:11.572 --> 00:26:13.066
I love you so much.

556
00:26:13.202 --> 00:26:16.342
I fucking love this pineapple.

557
00:26:16.478 --> 00:26:18.079
You're so beautiful.

558
00:26:20.514 --> 00:26:21.514
Wow.

559
00:26:31.889 --> 00:26:33.758
Okay. Sleep.

560
00:26:33.894 --> 00:26:36.126
Okay. Okay.

561
00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:43.369
Huh.

562
00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:47.976
Weird.

563
00:26:48.111 --> 00:26:49.111
What?

564
00:26:51.081 --> 00:26:52.109
Nothing.

565
00:27:01.254 --> 00:27:03.424
- John Kennedy was here.
- Yeah.

566
00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:04.823
Blue fin. Belly cut.

567
00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:06.322
- Best in the world.
- Mmm.

568
00:27:06.457 --> 00:27:07.934
Whoa. Cody.
I mean. this is sick.

569
00:27:07.958 --> 00:27:09.531
Very special knife.

570
00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:11.199
Slater got it for me
in Okinawa.

571
00:27:11.335 --> 00:27:12.626
And it's very sharp.

572
00:27:12.762 --> 00:27:14.545
I just don't want you to cut
yourself. all right. dude?

573
00:27:14.569 --> 00:27:16.167
It's an original Hattori.

574
00:27:16.303 --> 00:27:17.910
He decides to throw
himself a birthday party.

575
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:25.714
Thank you.

576
00:27:41.227 --> 00:27:44.426
There's something weird
going on here.

577
00:27:44.561 --> 00:27:47.736
If by weird. you mean
that you're losing. again?

578
00:27:47.871 --> 00:27:50.031
Yeah. shit's getting
pretty fucking weird.

579
00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:52.135
What happened to your pinky?

580
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.402
What's the first rule
of Fight Club?

581
00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.045
What?

582
00:28:01.181 --> 00:28:04.016
- Never mind. Here we go.

Six.

588
00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:16.160
Seven.

589
00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:18.899
Eight.

590
00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:21.033
Nine.

591
00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:23.931
Ten!

592
00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.009
No! No. no. no!

593
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:34.711
Hold it.

594
00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:37.445
I'm not... I'm not prepared...

595
00:29:12.555 --> 00:29:13.949
Having a good time?

596
00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.956
We're having a great time.

597
00:29:20.396 --> 00:29:21.456
Babe.

598
00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.998
Watermelon?

599
00:29:28.902 --> 00:29:31.033
That is a fat blunt. queen.

600
00:29:31.168 --> 00:29:33.303
Does anyone have a lighter?

601
00:29:39.014 --> 00:29:40.915
Heather. do you have
my lighter?

602
00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.480
Sorry.

603
00:30:10.012 --> 00:30:11.940
- Can I try?
- Yeah.

604
00:30:17.052 --> 00:30:18.452
What is that?

605
00:30:18.588 --> 00:30:20.185
Is it. like. strawberry?

606
00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:24.255
Ooh.

607
00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:27.224
That smells nice on you.

608
00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:30.195
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

609
00:30:39.972 --> 00:30:41.635
How'd you get that scar?

610
00:30:48.078 --> 00:30:49.445
I don't know.

611
00:31:02.532 --> 00:31:04.130
I like your nails.

612
00:31:05.194 --> 00:31:06.363
Thanks.

613
00:31:07.801 --> 00:31:09.404
I do them myself.

614
00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:10.565
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:31:11.974 --> 00:31:13.078
All right.
What do we got here?

616
00:31:13.102 --> 00:31:14.408
Blue cats.

617
00:31:14.543 --> 00:31:17.143
Yeah. Anailmals.

618
00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.447
What?

619
00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:23.112
It's. um. anailmals.

620
00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.316
It's animal nails.

621
00:31:26.616 --> 00:31:28.821
It's kind of my thing.
It's. um...

622
00:31:28.957 --> 00:31:30.956
- It's a play on...
- Oh. oh!

623
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:32.892
- You get it?
- Fuck! Yes.

624
00:31:33.028 --> 00:31:35.397
- "A-nail-mals."
- Anailmals.

625
00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:45.668
I gotta go to bed.

626
00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:48.134
- I gotta go to bed.
- What?

627
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.374
Why?

628
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.413
I got therapy in the morning.

629
00:31:52.548 --> 00:31:53.713
Oh. boo.

630
00:31:53.848 --> 00:31:55.214
Oh. boo. you.

631
00:31:56.884 --> 00:31:58.184
Wait. You forgot your...

632
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:17.571
Ew.

633
00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:38.026
Hello?

634
00:32:52.035 --> 00:32:53.239
Hello?

635
00:33:15.863 --> 00:33:16.957
Frida?

636
00:33:17.093 --> 00:33:18.462
Hi.

637
00:33:19.568 --> 00:33:20.662
Hey.

638
00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:24.101
I. um...

639
00:33:24.237 --> 00:33:25.804
I thought you might want this.

640
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.537
Thank you. That's sweet.

641
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.539
So...

642
00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.244
- Whatcha doin'?
- Oh. man.

643
00:33:32.379 --> 00:33:35.048
Oh. look who it is.

644
00:33:35.184 --> 00:33:37.448
- Frida. this is Rich.
- Hi.

645
00:33:37.983 --> 00:33:39.016
Rich. Frida.

646
00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:40.819
Very nice to meet you.

647
00:33:40.954 --> 00:33:42.420
I remember you.

648
00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.521
From the gala?

649
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.623
"Blink twice
if I'm in danger"?

650
00:33:49.798 --> 00:33:51.132
That's right.

651
00:33:51.701 --> 00:33:52.701
That's right.

652
00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:55.603
Amazing.

653
00:33:55.739 --> 00:33:56.763
Yeah. it's amazing.

654
00:33:56.899 --> 00:33:59.507
Hey. Stace?
It still feels weird here.

655
00:33:59.643 --> 00:34:00.643
Okay.

656
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.340
I think we should try it
someplace else.

657
00:34:02.475 --> 00:34:05.244
Why don't we just
light it on fire?

658
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.376
That might make it
a little less weird.

659
00:34:07.511 --> 00:34:08.842
- Don't do that.
- Hi.

660
00:34:08.978 --> 00:34:11.147
Don't... Don't do that.
You know it bums me out.

661
00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.455
- All right?
- Ah.

662
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.749
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:15.892 --> 00:34:17.091
All right. young man.

664
00:34:17.226 --> 00:34:19.257
I'm headed back
to the mountaintop.

665
00:34:19.392 --> 00:34:20.858
- Always enjoy our chats.
- Yes. sir.

666
00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:22.428
Thank you.

667
00:34:22.564 --> 00:34:26.067
- Oh. and thanks for the gift.
- I'll walk you out.

668
00:34:26.202 --> 00:34:27.762
Hey. hon.
do you have the light?

669
00:34:31.437 --> 00:34:33.471
Where's my knife?
Who has my knife?

670
00:34:34.744 --> 00:34:35.744
What?

671
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:37.431
My knife.
I can't find my special knife.

672
00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:39.471
Chill. You just
gotta ask somebody. man.

673
00:34:39.549 --> 00:34:40.274
You okay?

674
00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:41.743
Psst.

675
00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.051
Has anyone seen
Cody's special knife?

676
00:34:44.187 --> 00:34:45.813
I just don't know
where it went.

677
00:34:46.448 --> 00:34:47.982
You want this?

678
00:34:48.118 --> 00:34:50.167
No. thanks. Heather.
That weed makes me paranoid.

679
00:34:50.191 --> 00:34:52.193
Nobody has your stupid knife.

680
00:35:14.713 --> 00:35:16.811
Something horrible
is about to happen.

681
00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:21.420
What?

682
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.160
When things are good.

683
00:35:26.262 --> 00:35:28.295
that's when
the bad stuff happens.

684
00:35:31.861 --> 00:35:33.432
Why would you
think that?

685
00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.171
Life.

686
00:35:40.942 --> 00:35:42.408
What day is it?

687
00:35:45.012 --> 00:35:46.379
I don't know.

688
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.480
When are we leaving?

689
00:35:50.479 --> 00:35:51.819
Whenever you want.

690
00:35:51.954 --> 00:35:53.287
That's not an answer.

691
00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:56.488
Are you having a good time?

692
00:35:56.956 --> 00:35:57.956
Yes.

693
00:36:00.157 --> 00:36:01.361
Good.

694
00:36:03.426 --> 00:36:05.860
Boop.

695
00:36:26.021 --> 00:36:29.385
Okay. who has got it?

696
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.419
Who has got it this time. huh?

697
00:36:32.554 --> 00:36:34.691
- Not it.
- Oops.

698
00:36:36.431 --> 00:36:37.991
I don't even remember
taking it.

699
00:36:38.126 --> 00:36:41.062
- I know who took it.
- Eh. eh. oh. ah! Oh!

700
00:36:41.197 --> 00:36:43.430
What. do I gotta write my name
on this fucking thing?

701
00:36:43.566 --> 00:36:44.732
Oh. shit.

702
00:36:44.868 --> 00:36:48.368
Pop Rocks in a tangerine
mojito sorbet.

703
00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:51.909
Shut up! Shut up!

704
00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:53.044
I got it.

705
00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:54.348
I got it.

706
00:36:55.184 --> 00:36:56.315
I got it.

707
00:36:56.451 --> 00:36:57.179
- Let's go!
- Yes!

708
00:36:59.053 --> 00:37:00.054
Love it!

709
00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.022
Yeah!

710

711
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:08.964
That's right!

00:37:11.134 --> 00:37:13.499
All of this feels immaculate.

713

Oh. my goodness. Okay.

kid. is "fucking awesome."

746
00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:55.798
What is it?
Is it poisonous?

747
00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:57.493
It's venomous.
but you're not gonna die.

748
00:38:57.572 --> 00:38:58.879
- Oh. my God!
- No. no. no.

749
00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.475
- Is it dead?
- Here. Here.

750
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.615
You're okay. You're fine.

751
00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:03.205
Oh. my god!

752
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.015
Should I. like. be going to.
like. a hospital or something?

753
00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:07.140
- You'll be fine.
- Besides...

754
00:39:09.078 --> 00:39:11.848
there are no hospitals.

755
00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:17.150
You want
some more water?

756
00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:22.423
How's your hand?

757
00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:23.959
I feel weird.

758
00:39:26.463 --> 00:39:27.693
I want my phone.

759
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:29.096
Okay.

760
00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:32.039
I wanna go home.

761
00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:33.408
Okay. let's not go crazy.

762
00:39:33.543 --> 00:39:36.003
Everybody is. like.
smiling and laughing

763
00:39:36.138 --> 00:39:38.038
like 1960s fucking
flight attendants.

764
00:39:38.173 --> 00:39:39.811
Like. "Are you having
a good time?"

765
00:39:39.947 --> 00:39:41.907
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm having
a great time."

766
00:39:42.612 --> 00:39:45.750
I'm scared. Frida.

767
00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:47.558
I think
you just need some sleep.

768
00:39:47.582 --> 00:39:51.420
Don't. No. no. don't. don't.
don't do that. Don't do that.

769
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.529
Can't you feel it?

770
00:39:57.159 --> 00:40:01.568
There's something wrong
with this place.

771
00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:06.006
What's wrong?

772
00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:11.006
What's wrong?
I seriously want to know.

773
00:40:11.808 --> 00:40:13.811
Is it the amazing food?

774
00:40:13.946 --> 00:40:16.250
Or the tsunami of champagne?

775
00:40:16.385 --> 00:40:18.581
Or is it
the 1.020-thread-count

776
00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.187
fucking sheets? What is it?

777
00:40:20.322 --> 00:40:21.885
You're not listening to me.

778
00:40:22.354 --> 00:40:23.557
Please.

779
00:40:24.323 --> 00:40:25.526
Please.

780
00:40:26.662 --> 00:40:29.497
For the first time
in my life. I'm here.

781
00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:32.064
And
I'm not invisible.

782
00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:33.732
So please.

783
00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:35.866
Please.

784
00:40:40.274 --> 00:40:41.476
I'm sorry.

785
00:40:44.376 --> 00:40:45.579
I'm sorry.

786
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.080
Yeah.

787
00:40:47.477 --> 00:40:48.681
Okay.

788
00:40:54.016 --> 00:40:55.617
I'm gonna go lay down.

789
00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:47.602
Hello?

790
00:42:55.474 --> 00:42:56.743
Oh.

791
00:42:58.678 --> 00:42:59.944
Hi.

792
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:04.515
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just. um...

793
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.851
I was looking for Slater.

794
00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:07.688
Um...

795
00:43:08.717 --> 00:43:09.921
Hey.

796
00:43:11.326 --> 00:43:12.759
What's your name?

797
00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:15.129
Red rabbit.

798
00:43:15.264 --> 00:43:16.763
Red rabbit. right.

799
00:43:19.134 --> 00:43:20.134
Oh.

800
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.402
Oh. Don't worry. I won't tell.

801
00:43:24.537 --> 00:43:25.838
I'm not a narc.

802
00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:29.303
Sure.

803
00:43:36.745 --> 00:43:40.754
Oh. my God. what's in that?
That's crazy strong!

804
00:43:44.523 --> 00:43:46.155
Red rabbit.

805
00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:50.759
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

806
00:43:50.895 --> 00:43:54.001
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

807
00:43:54.136 --> 00:43:55.136
Red...

808
00:44:01.841 --> 00:44:03.504
What are you doing over here?

809
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.844
I. uh...

810
00:44:06.875 --> 00:44:08.513
I got lost.

811
00:44:08.648 --> 00:44:10.146
You wanna go that way.

812
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:14.254
Oh. the chickens got out.
Again.

813
00:44:14.389 --> 00:44:15.888
Fucking nightmare.

814
00:44:23.731 --> 00:44:25.162
Come here. you little fucker.

815
00:44:30.402 --> 00:44:32.402
Wait. wait. wait.

816
00:44:34.102 --> 00:44:35.842
Why are we running?

817
00:44:47.516 --> 00:44:49.757
I don't know
why we do that.

818
00:44:52.393 --> 00:44:53.728
Hide this.

819
00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:40.973
All right. who did this?

820
00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:44.306
Seriously.

821
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:49.344
When did I cut bangs?

822
00:45:54.657 --> 00:45:56.821
What's up?

823
00:45:56.957 --> 00:45:58.555
You've got a dick
on your face.

824
00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.192
Yep.

825
00:46:00.328 --> 00:46:02.656

00:46:08.434 --> 00:46:10.310
Oh. my God. Fuck. yeah.
There's blueberry muffins?

830
00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:11.966
It's
Slate's mom's recipe.

831
00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:14.337
Mmm. It's spectacular.

832
00:46:14.472 --> 00:46:16.392
- Thanks. bud.
- How'd you sleep?

833
00:46:16.905 --> 00:46:17.972
Amazing.

834
00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:19.346
All right. kids.

835
00:46:19.481 --> 00:46:21.145
Sails up.

836
00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:23.714
Who's ready to catch
some beautiful grouper?

837
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.279
Let's do it. Is it cool

838
00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:26.663
if I bring the muffins?

839
00:46:26.687 --> 00:46:27.787
Bring the muffins.

840
00:46:27.922 --> 00:46:29.720
Oh. how do we feel
about less loud?

841
00:46:29.856 --> 00:46:31.422
Sorry. babe.

842
00:46:31.557 --> 00:46:33.765
I don't think I can be on a
boat right now. to be honest.

843
00:46:33.789 --> 00:46:35.267
Come on. it'll be fun.

844
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:37.424
- Big old bucket of worms.
- Oh.

845
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.164
Maybe we'll just have
some girl time.

846
00:46:40.299 --> 00:46:43.836
You guys go
be with the worms.

847

00:46:47.372 --> 00:46:48.854
Tom. is that

850
00:46:48.878 --> 00:46:49.952

851
00:46:49.976 --> 00:46:51.307

Oh. I needed this!

854

Thank you.

861
00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:15.060
Where's Jess?

862
00:47:15.196 --> 00:47:17.132
What do you mean?

863
00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:19.038
What do you mean.
"What do I mean?"

864
00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:23.141
Jess.

865
00:47:28.142 --> 00:47:30.049
Who is Jess?

866
00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.155
You okay?

867
00:47:39.527 --> 00:47:41.291
Is she okay?

868
00:47:42.724 --> 00:47:44.862
You don't look so good.
What's wrong?

869
00:47:44.998 --> 00:47:46.461
Yeah. what's wrong?

870
00:47:49.803 --> 00:47:51.301
Are you fucking with me?

871
00:47:53.336 --> 00:47:55.008
- Where's Jess?
- Huh? What. hon?

872
00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:56.813
My friend that was
in the room next to mine.

873
00:47:56.837 --> 00:47:59.474
Uh. the storage room?

874
00:48:00.709 --> 00:48:02.943
Hey. relax.
You're on vacation.

875
00:48:03.078 --> 00:48:04.380
Oh. Jesus.

876
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.628
Wake up!

877
00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:25.330
Wake up!

878
00:48:25.466 --> 00:48:28.239
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

879
00:48:59.806 --> 00:49:01.271
Jess was here.

880
00:49:01.407 --> 00:49:02.942
- Jess was here!
- Hmm.

881
00:49:03.077 --> 00:49:04.603
And she said...
She said

882
00:49:04.739 --> 00:49:06.218
there was something wrong
with this place.

883
00:49:06.242 --> 00:49:07.443
I hear you.

884
00:49:09.383 --> 00:49:12.283
And I don't want to sound
like... like a bitch.

885
00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:16.587
It's just. like.
I feel like I would know

886
00:49:16.722 --> 00:49:19.654
if there was. like. this whole
other person here. you know?

887
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:22.159
I know
it doesn't make any sense.

888
00:49:22.294 --> 00:49:23.931
It doesn't make
any sense. but...

889
00:49:24.066 --> 00:49:25.373
I feel like...
I feel like

890
00:49:25.397 --> 00:49:27.529
we're forgetting.
like. a lot of stuff.

891
00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:31.599
How do we feel about
putting down the knife?

892
00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:34.739
Yeah?

893
00:49:35.841 --> 00:49:37.570
Yeah. I'm sorry.

894
00:49:37.706 --> 00:49:40.113
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

895
00:49:41.849 --> 00:49:42.849
It's okay.

896
00:49:42.947 --> 00:49:44.216
I'm sorry.

897
00:49:46.747 --> 00:49:48.187
What day is it?

898
00:49:49.183 --> 00:49:50.387
Huh?

899
00:49:52.157 --> 00:49:53.588
Do you know what day it is?

900
00:49:55.695 --> 00:49:56.695
No.

901
00:49:58.926 --> 00:50:01.299
But. like. I never know
what day it is.

902
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:03.570
Right.

903
00:50:05.006 --> 00:50:07.107
I'm having a great time here.

904
00:50:11.747 --> 00:50:13.179
But I also have this

905
00:50:14.112 --> 00:50:15.577
feeling that I'm. like...

906
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.548
not.

907
00:50:22.387 --> 00:50:23.955
- Does that make sense?
- Yes.

908
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.170
I have dirt under my nails.

909
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:26.687
and I don't know
how it got there.

910
00:50:27.822 --> 00:50:30.163
I'm sorry.
What is this?

911
00:50:31.062 --> 00:50:32.396
What is that?

912
00:50:32.532 --> 00:50:34.104
They were like...
"Oh. Sarah...

913
00:50:34.128 --> 00:50:36.497
you were climbing up a tree
and you were so wasted.

914
00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:38.068
you fell."
Uh-mmm.

915
00:50:38.203 --> 00:50:39.469
I didn't last eight seasons

916
00:50:39.604 --> 00:50:41.808
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes</i>
because I fell.

917
00:50:41.944 --> 00:50:43.209
So you don't think I'm crazy?

918
00:50:43.344 --> 00:50:46.079
What's crazy is that
we got onto a plane

919
00:50:46.214 --> 00:50:48.442
with a bunch of dudes
we don't know.

920
00:50:48.577 --> 00:50:50.350
I thought
you all knew each other.

921
00:50:50.486 --> 00:50:51.486
No.

922
00:50:54.784 --> 00:50:57.684
Cody just chatted me up
at a coffee shop.

923
00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.191
just talking about
how he knew Slater King.

924
00:51:00.326 --> 00:51:02.191
But Heather and Camilla.

925
00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:03.493
they know everybody. right?

926
00:51:05.668 --> 00:51:06.793
I don't know.

927
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:16.338
Oh. my God!

928
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:17.877
What the fuck
were we thinking?

929
00:51:18.013 --> 00:51:19.480
- Oh. fuck!
- I knew it!

930
00:51:19.615 --> 00:51:20.681
I knew it!

931
00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:21.816
I knew it! I knew it!

932
00:51:21.909 --> 00:51:23.347
I knew it was
too good to be true.

933
00:51:23.482 --> 00:51:25.042
Of course they're fucking
with our heads

934
00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:26.484
because that's what they do.

935
00:51:26.619 --> 00:51:29.652
They distract us with
these cute little outfits.

936
00:51:29.788 --> 00:51:33.693
and they shower us with
raspberries and champagne.

937
00:51:33.828 --> 00:51:34.828
But you know what?

938
00:51:34.889 --> 00:51:36.896
We know
what's really going on.

939
00:51:37.032 --> 00:51:39.198
They are trying to control us.

940
00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:42.334
They're trying
to make us look crazy.

941
00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:50.144
And it's working.

942
00:51:55.148 --> 00:51:56.744
So they're making us forget.

943
00:51:57.718 --> 00:51:58.750
Yeah.

944
00:51:58.886 --> 00:51:59.912
Okay. but like...

945
00:52:00.853 --> 00:52:01.853
how?

946
00:52:06.896 --> 00:52:08.426
"Forgetting is a gift."

947
00:52:10.324 --> 00:52:11.527
Huh?

948
00:52:11.662 --> 00:52:14.762
Slater said.
"Forgetting is a gift."

949
00:52:15.736 --> 00:52:16.896
Oh...

950
00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:21.808
I don't get it.

951
00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:32.815
We need to call the cops.

952
00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:34.020
Yes.

953
00:52:34.156 --> 00:52:35.682
- We need to call the FBI.
- Yes.

954
00:52:35.818 --> 00:52:37.955
We need to call the cops
and the FBI.

955
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.090
Okay. but wait.

956
00:52:39.126 --> 00:52:41.228
- What?
- Wait. wait.

957
00:52:41.363 --> 00:52:42.871
Say we call the cops
and the FBI. right?

958
00:52:42.895 --> 00:52:43.989
Uh-huh...

959
00:52:44.124 --> 00:52:46.493
And we're. like.
"Hi. Hello. Please send help.

960
00:52:46.628 --> 00:52:47.748
"Slater King and his buddies

961
00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:49.797
are doing
horrible things to us."

962
00:52:49.932 --> 00:52:52.203
They're gonna be like.
"What did they do?"

963
00:52:52.338 --> 00:52:53.933
And we're gonna be like.
"Um...

964
00:52:54.843 --> 00:52:55.935
We don't know."

965
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.781
"'Cause they've been
secretly erasing memories

966
00:52:57.805 --> 00:52:59.805
with perfume. I guess."

967
00:52:59.941 --> 00:53:02.111
And the guys
would be like. "What?"

968
00:53:02.247 --> 00:53:03.514
"We would never do that.

969
00:53:03.649 --> 00:53:04.989
other white guys
we probably play golf with."

970
00:53:05.013 --> 00:53:06.261
And Heather and Camilla
will be like.

971
00:53:06.285 --> 00:53:07.584
"Nothing but good times

972
00:53:07.719 --> 00:53:09.521
and fat fucking blunts
over here. officer."

973
00:53:09.656 --> 00:53:12.354
And I'll be like.
"Come on. guys. believe women."

974
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.755
"Here is my friend's lighter."

975
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.539
And they'll be like.
"Sure thing. Of course."

976
00:53:15.563 --> 00:53:17.825
"You crazy fucking bitch."

977
00:53:19.428 --> 00:53:21.034
Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:22.333
- Look at me.
- Okay.

979
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:23.708
- Let's get on the same page.
- Okay.

980
00:53:23.732 --> 00:53:25.267
Your friend. you remember her?

981
00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:26.638
Yes.

982
00:53:27.341 --> 00:53:29.606
- But I don't remember her.
- No.

983
00:53:30.939 --> 00:53:33.280
What's up with that?

984
00:53:36.249 --> 00:53:37.614
She got bit by a snake.

985
00:53:39.288 --> 00:53:41.321
Okay?

986
00:53:42.825 --> 00:53:43.983
And I drank this.

987
00:53:44.958 --> 00:53:46.423
What's in there?

988
00:53:46.558 --> 00:53:47.855
I'm pretty sure
it's snake venom.

989
00:53:49.289 --> 00:53:52.057
You think snake venom's
gonna make us remember?

990
00:53:52.426 --> 00:53:53.630
Yeah.

991
00:53:55.429 --> 00:53:56.633
Fuck it.

992
00:54:01.075 --> 00:54:02.639
- Yeah.
- Oh. God!

993
00:54:02.774 --> 00:54:05.409
- It's really bad.
- Oh. that's... That's venom?

994
00:54:05.545 --> 00:54:07.344
- Yeah. dude.
- Why didn't you warn me?

995
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.142
- I did.
- That is disgusting.

996
00:54:09.278 --> 00:54:11.883
How are we gonna get Heather
and Camilla to drink that?

997
00:54:12.019 --> 00:54:13.815
Oh. man.

998
00:54:14.855 --> 00:54:15.855
Tequila?

999
00:54:17.388 --> 00:54:19.825
Shots. bitches!

1000
00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:32.537
- Holy shit!
- What's in these?

1001
00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.473
Snake venom?

1002
00:54:43.282 --> 00:54:44.813
Slam it. girlfriends.

1003
00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:47.948
I used to slam it.

1004
00:54:55.161 --> 00:54:56.295
Fuck! No way.

1005
00:54:56.431 --> 00:54:57.911
that was fucking crazy!

1006
00:54:58.032 --> 00:54:59.692
Tangy.

1007
00:54:59.827 --> 00:55:01.534
Fuck!

1008
00:55:01.669 --> 00:55:05.769
Stan. uh. radioed. by the way.
on the. um. thingy

1009
00:55:05.905 --> 00:55:09.234
that the boys are gonna be
back soon from fishing.

1010
00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:12.043
which means that I had
better...

1011
00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:13.345
Okay.

1012
00:55:13.481 --> 00:55:16.443
- Goodbye. ladies.
- Bye. Stace.

1013
00:55:16.578 --> 00:55:17.812
Oh. yes!

1014
00:55:17.948 --> 00:55:19.263
I'm going for the phones.
Keep a lookout.

1015
00:55:19.287 --> 00:55:20.418
- Okay. Wait. wait.
- Okay.

1016
00:55:20.554 --> 00:55:22.088
What do I do
when the boys come back?

1017
00:55:22.224 --> 00:55:24.521
I don't know. Fucking yell...

1018
00:55:24.657 --> 00:55:26.689
"fat blunts"
as loud as you can.

1019
00:55:26.825 --> 00:55:28.454
- Okay.
- Don't forget to smile.

1020
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:29.961
Fat blunts.

1021
00:55:30.096 --> 00:55:31.096
More shots?

1022
00:55:32.394 --> 00:55:33.895
Yeah.

1023
00:56:02.122 --> 00:56:03.529
Wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1024
00:56:10.072 --> 00:56:10.863
Fuck!

1025
00:56:10.998 --> 00:56:12.538
Bad bitches for life.

1026
00:56:12.674 --> 00:56:14.284
- Bad bitches for life.
- Wait. No. wait.

1027
00:56:14.308 --> 00:56:15.673
- Oh!
- You dropped it!

1028
00:56:17.873 --> 00:56:19.842
Oh. God!

1029
00:56:23.852 --> 00:56:24.852
Oh. fuck.

1030
00:56:25.579 --> 00:56:26.750
Wait.

1031
00:56:27.185 --> 00:56:28.521
Sarah?

1032
00:56:28.657 --> 00:56:31.051
Dude. you... what happened
to your nose. man?

1033
00:56:35.756 --> 00:56:37.157
Hey. girls...

1034
00:56:37.292 --> 00:56:40.293
maybe we should
cool it on the shots.

1035
00:56:40.428 --> 00:56:43.001
Just trust me. I think...
I think they're really strong.

1036
00:56:44.198 --> 00:56:46.170
I'm. like.
really hardcore. so...

1037
00:56:46.306 --> 00:56:47.504
Just give it to me.

1038
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.970
- No. Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Give it.

1039
00:56:49.106 --> 00:56:51.141
Come on. <i>mami.</i>
Just worry about yourself.

1040
00:56:51.276 --> 00:56:52.276
We got this.

1041
00:56:57.618 --> 00:56:59.519
Oh. look. look. look.

1042
00:57:07.461 --> 00:57:09.395
- Fuck!
- Oh. fuck!

1043
00:57:09.531 --> 00:57:11.630
What the fuck. babe?
It's just me!

1044
00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:18.788
I'm sorry.

1045
00:57:18.869 --> 00:57:20.138
I just don't like
to be tickled.

1046
00:57:20.274 --> 00:57:21.567
Ooh. bro!

1047
00:57:21.702 --> 00:57:23.169
Fuck! Fuck!

1048
00:57:25.311 --> 00:57:26.513
Come on. Come on.

1049
00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:33.618
When I was. like. four.
my sister. she pushed me.

1050
00:57:33.753 --> 00:57:35.316
Um. accidentally.
She's not a sociopath.

1051
00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:39.086
And my two front teeth just
shot right back up into their.

1052
00:57:39.755 --> 00:57:41.291
uh. the tooth holes.

1053
00:57:41.426 --> 00:57:42.727
It was disgusting.

1054
00:57:42.862 --> 00:57:45.264
But they were baby teeth.
so they grew back.

1055
00:57:45.399 --> 00:57:46.508
Are you all right?

1056
00:57:46.532 --> 00:57:47.732
Sorry. how's your nose?

1057
00:57:51.403 --> 00:57:52.931
Where's Frida?

1058
00:57:53.067 --> 00:57:54.908
Uh. she's just freshening up.

1059
00:57:56.337 --> 00:57:59.010
All right.
I'll see y'all in a minute.

1060
00:57:59.145 --> 00:58:00.145
Wait!

1061
00:58:00.608 --> 00:58:01.812
Hmm?

1062
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:04.745
We're just gonna

1063
00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:07.587
smoke a... fat blunt!

1064
00:58:08.689 --> 00:58:10.116
Go off. queen!

1065
00:58:10.251 --> 00:58:13.659
Yep! We're gonna smoke
a big. fat blunt!

1066
00:58:18.296 --> 00:58:19.296
Okay.

1067
00:58:20.434 --> 00:58:21.434
Okay.

1068
00:58:21.565 --> 00:58:23.500
Let's fucking go!

1069
00:58:23.635 --> 00:58:25.165
Oh. I can't wait!

1070
00:58:32.513 --> 00:58:34.272
We've got ourselves

1071
00:58:34.408 --> 00:58:37.243
a sticky situation.

1072
00:58:40.252 --> 00:58:41.555
Yeah.

1073
00:58:44.685 --> 00:58:45.889
Come on.

1074
00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:47.926
Fuck!

1075

What's up. guys?

1076
00:58:53.969 --> 00:58:54.969
Yo.

1077
00:58:57.431 --> 00:58:59.270
Does anyone
have a lighter?

1078
00:58:59.406 --> 00:59:00.805
Are you okay. babe?

1079
00:59:02.043 --> 00:59:03.141
Yeah.

1080
00:59:03.277 --> 00:59:04.469
Yeah. I'm just

1081
00:59:04.604 --> 00:59:08.208
really excited about this...
fat blunt.

1082
00:59:16.356 --> 00:59:17.690
Me too.

1083
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:24.158
Fuck! Shit!

1084
01:01:09.597 --> 01:01:12.838
What are we
gonna do about you?

1085
01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:14.741
Hmm?

1086
01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.241
What are we gonna do?

1087
01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:25.950
It's...

1088
01:01:27.585 --> 01:01:29.453
weird here.

1089
01:01:29.588 --> 01:01:30.588
Doesn't work here.

1090
01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:31.719
- Stace...
- Huh?

1091
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.354
...is it weird here?

1092
01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.289
No. I. uh. I like it there.
I like it right there.

1093
01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:39.491
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Stan?

1094
01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.863
- It's a little weird.
- Right?

1095
01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:47.037
I concur.
Bitches be trippin'.

1096
01:01:47.172 --> 01:01:48.685
Does anyone
want any champagne?

1097
01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:49.783
But then. let's love 'em.

1098
01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:52.312
Wait. You didn't get any.

1099
01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:54.341
Go again. girl. Here.

1100
01:01:55.484 --> 01:01:56.948
Crazy times. man.

1101
01:02:02.657 --> 01:02:05.320
That's what I'm talking about.

1102
01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.827
It's comfy.
but it just... I don't know.

1103
01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:12.596
Is it too red? I feel like
it's a little too red.

1104
01:02:27.207 --> 01:02:28.748
You could help.

1105
01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:30.743
I'm fucking eating here.

1106
01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:34.291
Somebody's getting a dick
drawn on his forehead tonight.

1107
01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:35.755
- What?
- Nothing.

1108
01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.920
Stop moving. babe.

1109
01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:40.120
stop moving!

1110
01:02:40.255 --> 01:02:41.535
Are we doing this.
or what?

1111
01:02:41.622 --> 01:02:43.293
Damn it.
this is so fucked up!

1112
01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:45.664
Shut up. She got bit.
She remembers everything.

1113
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.497
- No. no.
- No. no. no!

1114
01:02:55.574 --> 01:02:57.006
Yeah. Okay.

1115
01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:59.774
Let's. uh.
let's get rid of it.

1116
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.476
You want it? Stace?

1117
01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.520
- Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.
- How about you take it?

1118
01:03:03.544 --> 01:03:05.885
Oh. I'm an idiot!
Stan. give me a hand.

1119
01:03:07.122 --> 01:03:09.217
I can't believe that
I didn't think of this before.

1120
01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.968
It was sitting right there
the entire time.

1121
01:03:10.992 --> 01:03:12.592
right in front of my face.

1122
01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:15.561
Okay.

1123
01:03:20.027 --> 01:03:22.132
Wait. Okay.

1124
01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.568
Now. why didn't we
just do here first?

1125
01:03:33.712 --> 01:03:35.145
Frida!

1126
01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:37.912
Hey. Frida!

Oh!

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.154
Yeah!

1133
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.726

Okay.

01:04:02.874 --> 01:04:05.637
So how did the phones go?

1140
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.014
Bad.

1141
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:13.582
It went very bad.

1142
01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.016
Okay.

1143
01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:16.887
Has your venom kicked in yet?

1144
01:04:17.022 --> 01:04:19.018
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:04:19.154 --> 01:04:20.454
Heather and Camilla?

1146
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.693
Those bitches are
a ticking fucking time bomb.

What?

1151
01:04:28.495 --> 01:04:30.069
We saw what they did to Jess.

1152
01:04:30.204 --> 01:04:32.009

- Yeah.

1154
01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:38.208
They killed her
'cause she wasn't forgetting.

1155
01:04:41.343 --> 01:04:43.246
This one is for you.

1156
01:04:43.915 --> 01:04:46.078

I love you. bitches!

1158
01:04:53.253 --> 01:04:54.625

Hi... you.

1161
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:02.397

1162
01:05:03.471 --> 01:05:04.564

1163
01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:06.445
Aw. I missed you too.

1164

01:08:54.433 --> 01:08:55.833
"Oh. word?
Say less. Send the addy."

1253
01:08:55.864 --> 01:08:57.678
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause I'm from Dyckman.

1254
01:08:57.702 --> 01:09:01.207
And I lead with so much
love...

1255
01:09:01.342 --> 01:09:03.240
But I'm quick to fuck

1256
01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:04.939

1260
01:09:15.249 --> 01:09:16.385
Hmm?

1261
01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:17.733

1264
01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:31.002
It's been great. Yeah. Yeah.

1265
01:09:31.138 --> 01:09:32.500
It's just always been

1266
01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:34.305
hard for me
to make girlfriends.

1267
01:09:34.441 --> 01:09:36.374
- so it's been nice.
- Hmm. Oh.

1268

Yeah.

1270
01:09:41.512 --> 01:09:43.315

1271
01:09:44.851 --> 01:09:46.146
Yeah. babe.

1272
01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:47.484
Um...

1273
01:09:48.019 --> 01:09:49.222
Well...

1274
01:09:50.218 --> 01:09:51.918
Women

1275
01:09:52.053 --> 01:09:54.091
have been taught to
compete against each other.

1276
01:09:54.227 --> 01:09:55.887
- Right?
- Hmm.

1277
01:09:56.022 --> 01:09:58.027
When really
we should be helping...

1278
01:09:58.162 --> 01:10:00.695
I mean. supporting

1279
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.367
each other. So. I don't know.

1280
01:10:03.502 --> 01:10:05.267
I've just
been thinking

1281
01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:08.801
that maybe when I get home.

1282
01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:10.183
that it would be nice
to start. like.

1283
01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:11.508
this program thing

1284
01:10:11.643 --> 01:10:13.775
where I. like.
teach women survival skills.

1285
01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:17.612
And I know that show was
stupid and totally degrading.

1286
01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:20.582
but I learned some
really useful shit.

1287
01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.191
And the truth is.
is that you never know

1288
01:10:22.215 --> 01:10:23.961
when you're gonna be stuck
in the middle of nowhere

1289
01:10:23.985 --> 01:10:26.088
in. like. a totally
terrifying situation

1290
01:10:26.224 --> 01:10:27.422
with no one to save you.

1291
01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.224
no one to even
hear you scream.

1292
01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.592
and you need to fight

1293
01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:32.288
for your fucking life!

1294
01:10:39.072 --> 01:10:40.768
'Cause it's scary...

1295
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:44.673
out there.

1296
01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:55.519
Yeah.

1297
01:10:56.482 --> 01:10:57.482
It so is.

1298
01:10:59.019 --> 01:11:00.788
It is terrifying.

1299
01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:03.323
I just got so excited.

1300
01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.957
No. I do the same thing.

1301
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.598
Yeah. it really is.

1302
01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.174
You know.
my cousin's wife got mugged

1303
01:11:12.205 --> 01:11:13.598
outside a Petco last week.

1304
01:11:13.734 --> 01:11:15.140
- Oh. my God!
- You see?

1305
01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:17.009
- Is she okay?
- No.

1306
01:11:17.145 --> 01:11:18.839
You know what's great. though?

1307
01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.143
Just women.

1308
01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:22.576
when they band together.

1309
01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:24.614
it's really beautiful.

1310
01:11:28.286 --> 01:11:29.883

You wanna what?

1318
01:11:58.478 --> 01:11:59.682
No.

1319
01:12:05.156 --> 01:12:06.251
All right.

1320
01:12:06.953 --> 01:12:08.391

01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:23.519
Guys?

1431
01:20:25.685 --> 01:20:28.388
Guys. we need the hospital.

1432
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:30.856
Oh. fuck. I need a hospital.

1433
01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.126
Fuck!

1434
01:20:32.262 --> 01:20:34.227
Oh. my God!

1435
01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:35.843
They know. dude.
They know everything.

1436
01:20:35.968 --> 01:20:37.208
We're gonna go to hell
for this.

1437
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.407
What do you mean?
We're such nice guys.

1438
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:40.272
- Drink this.
- Oh. my God!

1439
01:20:40.407 --> 01:20:41.885
- You got perfumed. dude.
- What does that mean?

1440
01:20:41.909 --> 01:20:43.316
That's why
you don't remember.

1441
01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.613
- What does that mean?
- Guys?

1442
01:20:44.637 --> 01:20:46.042
Will someone
please tell me

1443
01:20:46.177 --> 01:20:47.422
what the fuck's going on?

1444
01:20:50.483 --> 01:20:51.483
Guys?

1445
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.481
Guys?

1446
01:21:26.552 --> 01:21:27.552
Red rabbit.

1447
01:21:31.484 --> 01:21:32.989
I don't understand.

1448
01:21:33.125 --> 01:21:34.525
I am not...
You go out there.

1449
01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.493
Okay. stop!
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1450
01:21:36.628 --> 01:21:37.628
You can do this.

1451
01:21:37.656 --> 01:21:38.893
I don't like
this game anymore.

1452
01:21:39.029 --> 01:21:40.069
Hey. Come here. Come here.

1453
01:21:40.127 --> 01:21:41.294
Just go outside

1454
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.364
- and go get the girls.
- All right.

1455
01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:45.966
Fuck.

1456
01:21:46.066 --> 01:21:47.269
It's okay.

1457
01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.206
You're just...

1458
01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:53.044
remembering.

1459
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.147
But I... I didn't...

1460
01:21:58.811 --> 01:22:01.413
I didn't want to remember!

1461
01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:04.314
They're gonna do
what they're gonna do.

1462
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:06.283
You child.

1463
01:22:06.419 --> 01:22:09.192
Forgetting is a gift. hon.

1464
01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:22.601
Help me. Help me.

1465
01:22:23.302 --> 01:22:24.702
Bitch. I tried.

1466
01:22:34.147 --> 01:22:35.350
Who's there?

1467
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:38.287
It's just me. babe.

1468
01:22:43.795 --> 01:22:44.997
Here.

1469
01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.237
What did I do?

1470
01:22:59.413 --> 01:23:00.441
Nothing.

1471
01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.408
Thank God!

1472
01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.181
No. no. no.
I meant. you did...

1473
01:23:05.277 --> 01:23:06.480
you did nothing.

1474
01:23:07.855 --> 01:23:09.516
You did nothing for yourself.

1475
01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:12.783
You did nothing for them.

1476
01:23:17.731 --> 01:23:19.393
And. in my opinion.

1477
01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:21.661
there's a real special place
in hell

1478
01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:25.070
reserved for people that
just choose to do nothing.

1479
01:23:28.702 --> 01:23:30.603
Why do you think
you chose to do nothing?

1480
01:23:48.761 --> 01:23:50.293
What the fuck?

1481
01:23:54.395 --> 01:23:55.515
This is impossible unless...

1482
01:23:55.562 --> 01:23:57.300
I've been here before.

1483
01:24:05.745 --> 01:24:06.804
What do we do?

1484
01:24:08.541 --> 01:24:10.445

01:24:45.117 --> 01:24:46.281
Oh. is he gonna do something?

1501
01:24:46.417 --> 01:24:47.824
I don't know
what's happening.

1502
01:24:47.848 --> 01:24:49.814
Everyone's fucking crazy
out here. Please help me!

1503
01:24:49.949 --> 01:24:51.362
Are you gonna do something.

1504
01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.455
Slater. I'm scared!

1505
01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:56.158
Don't open the door.

1506
01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:57.594
Don't open the door. Okay.

1507
01:25:07.039 --> 01:25:08.569
Shit!

1508
01:25:12.339 --> 01:25:13.743
I'm really sorry.

1509
01:25:15.913 --> 01:25:16.913
Look at you.

1510
01:25:18.018 --> 01:25:20.115
- Please!
- You're beautiful.

1511
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:21.415
Come here. Come here. Stop.

1512
01:25:21.551 --> 01:25:23.782
Stop. stop.
It's okay. All right?

1513
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:28.259
Hi.

1514
01:25:33.996 --> 01:25:35.029
Hi.

1515
01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:43.840
Yeah. It's good there.

1516
01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:19.211
I like your nails.

1517
01:26:21.444 --> 01:26:23.908
That's gonna scar.

1518
01:26:31.684 --> 01:26:32.851
You havin' a good time?

1519
01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:36.324
I'm having a great...

1520
01:26:38.995 --> 01:26:40.364
Hi.

1521
01:26:42.462 --> 01:26:43.961
Welcome back.

1522
01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:48.806
Fucking bitch.

1523
01:26:48.941 --> 01:26:50.842
Ah... Fuck him.

1524
01:26:50.977 --> 01:26:52.277
Don't worry about him.

1525
01:26:52.412 --> 01:26:54.052
He's just still mad
about the pinky thing.

1526
01:26:55.814 --> 01:26:56.814
Fuck!

1527
01:26:56.877 --> 01:26:58.412
I thought last year
was intense.

1528
01:26:58.548 --> 01:27:01.147
but you've really
outdone yourself.

1529
01:27:06.759 --> 01:27:07.787
So...

1530
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:10.691
everybody's dead.

1531
01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:14.160
What now?

1532
01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.829
I'm just saying.

1533
01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:18.936
there is a version of this
where we're all just

1534
01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:20.668
still havin' a good time.

1535
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:24.474
And sipping mimosas
and green juices.

1536
01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.009
And laughing at brunch.

1537
01:27:29.548 --> 01:27:31.377
'Cause brunch.
brunch is real.

1538
01:27:31.513 --> 01:27:33.747
Brunch is so fucking real.

1539
01:27:36.156 --> 01:27:38.015
You want to know
what's not real?

1540
01:27:45.227 --> 01:27:46.489
Forgiveness.

1541
01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:48.129
I'll show you.

1542
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.572
I. Slater King. would like
to formally apologize

1543
01:27:51.596 --> 01:27:52.865
for my behavior.

1544
01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:55.001
I've sought therapy.

1545
01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.749
and I'm gonna take a leave
of absence from my company

1546
01:27:56.773 --> 01:27:59.938
while I face these issues
head-on. I'm sorry.

1547
01:28:03.817 --> 01:28:04.943
I'm sorry.

1548
01:28:06.316 --> 01:28:07.913
I'm sorry.

1549
01:28:10.924 --> 01:28:12.357
I'm sorry. I'm...

1550
01:28:13.927 --> 01:28:15.987
I'm... I'm sorry.

1551
01:28:16.929 --> 01:28:18.462
I'm sorry.

1552
01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:24.732
I'm sorry.

1553
01:28:26.336 --> 01:28:27.970
I'm sorry!

1554
01:28:28.105 --> 01:28:29.433
I'm sorry!

1555
01:28:29.568 --> 01:28:31.039
I'm sorry!

1556
01:28:31.174 --> 01:28:32.436
I'm sorry!

1557
01:28:32.571 --> 01:28:33.943
I'm sorry!

1558
01:28:34.078 --> 01:28:35.274
I'm sorry!

1559
01:28:35.409 --> 01:28:36.715
I'm sorry!

1560
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:37.850
I'm sorry!

1561
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:38.950
I'm sorry!

1562
01:28:39.083 --> 01:28:40.083
I'm sorry!

1563
01:28:40.183 --> 01:28:41.214
I'm sorry!

1564
01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:42.349
I'm sorry!

1565
01:28:42.416 --> 01:28:43.447
I'm sorry!

1566
01:28:43.582 --> 01:28:45.049
I'm sorry!

1567
01:28:50.593 --> 01:28:51.793
So. we good?

1568
01:28:54.031 --> 01:28:55.031
No?

1569
01:28:56.266 --> 01:28:57.732
That's right.

1570
01:29:00.403 --> 01:29:04.376
There is no forgiveness.

1571
01:29:06.275 --> 01:29:08.076
There's just

1572
01:29:08.211 --> 01:29:10.013
forgetting.

1573
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:11.680
There's just forgetting.

1574
01:29:14.247 --> 01:29:16.683
Which. by the way.
you are fucking incredible at.

1575
01:29:16.819 --> 01:29:19.187
You forgot about
the entire goddamn place.

1576
01:29:19.322 --> 01:29:20.322
That's amazing.

1577
01:29:20.391 --> 01:29:21.511
Imagine what humans could be

1578
01:29:21.625 --> 01:29:24.925
capable of if we could
free them

1579
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.532
from the suffering
and the pain of their trauma.

1580
01:29:28.668 --> 01:29:31.836
Oh. my God. my sister.
my sister would be...

1581
01:29:31.972 --> 01:29:33.031
she'd be free.

1582
01:29:33.166 --> 01:29:34.965
She'd be free
'cause she's so fucked up.

1583
01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:36.706
because she remembers
everything.

1584
01:29:36.841 --> 01:29:39.136
She remembers every
single thing. She's. like...

1585
01:29:39.272 --> 01:29:41.612
"How could you go and
play tennis with that man

1586
01:29:41.747 --> 01:29:43.507
after what he did to us
when we were little?"

1587
01:29:43.642 --> 01:29:45.617
And I'm. like...

1588
01:29:45.752 --> 01:29:48.446
I'm over here just.
like. "What did he do?"

1589
01:29:48.582 --> 01:29:50.054
"What did he do?"

1590
01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:51.848
"What the fuck did he do?"

1591
01:29:51.983 --> 01:29:53.722
"I don't know what he did."

1592
01:30:02.763 --> 01:30:04.365
This is gonna be great.

1593
01:30:06.803 --> 01:30:09.337
We can forget
all of this.

1594
01:30:09.472 --> 01:30:12.074
Come on. Me and you both.

1595
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:13.544
Let's just...

1596
01:30:15.874 --> 01:30:17.812
Just a quick spritz.

1597
01:30:19.816 --> 01:30:21.478
What do you think?

1598
01:30:21.614 --> 01:30:22.817
Well...

1599
01:30:25.017 --> 01:30:26.517
I feel...

1600
01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:30.254
Fuck!

1601
01:30:30.389 --> 01:30:32.272
- I feel like...
- Okay. um...

1602
01:30:32.296 --> 01:30:34.092
Hold that thought.

1603
01:30:35.201 --> 01:30:36.600
I'm gonna be right back.

1604
01:30:37.735 --> 01:30:39.236
I want to hear
what you want to say.

1605
01:30:39.372 --> 01:30:40.572
I'm gonna be right back. okay?

1606
01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.152
Hey.

1607
01:31:19.606 --> 01:31:20.941

You're right.
There is no forgiveness.

01:33:17.295 --> 01:33:18.388
Only forgetting.

1644
01:33:32.475 --> 01:33:33.678

Not here.
