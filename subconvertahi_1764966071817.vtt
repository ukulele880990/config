2
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.350
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.890
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

4
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.900
"I'm through. never again.
too dangerous."

5
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.460
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

6
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.940
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

7
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

8
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.340
You know. when you go on like this.
what you sound like?

9
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.440
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

10
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.970
- Quack. quack. quack.
- Take heart. 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.540
Since I'm never gonna
do it again. you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

12
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.350
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

13
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.260
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh. yes!

14
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.790
I mean. the way it is now.

16
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.670
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

17
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.900
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

19
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.210
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

20
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.740
Heard about this one bloke. he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

21
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.790
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says.

22
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.420
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money. we're gonna kill her."

23
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.290
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

24
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.200
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol.
not a shotgun. a fuckin' phone.

25
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.900
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

26
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.670
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

27
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.730
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

28
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.780
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

29
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.280
I'm illustrating if we did. it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

30
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.510
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah. no more liquor stores.

31
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.560
Besides. it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

32
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.560
Vietnamese. Koreans.
don't even speak fuckin' English.

33
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.990
You tell 'em empty out
the register. they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000
They make it too personal.

35
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.300
- We keep on. one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

36
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.670
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

37
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.670
And if it's not the gooks.

38
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.370
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

39
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.880
You got Grandpa lrving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

40
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.880
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

41
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

42
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.890
- We're out of it.
- Well. what then. day jobs?

43
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.980
- Not in this life.
- What then?

44
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.350
Garçon. coffee!

45
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.730
This place.

46
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280
Garçon means boy.

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.190
This place?
A coffee shop?

48
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.230
What's wrong with that?

49
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.960
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

50
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.370
Bars. liquor stores.

51
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.170
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

52
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.910
Restaurants. on the other hand.
you catch with their pants down.

53
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.680
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

54
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.250
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

55
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.590
Same as banks.
these places are insured.

56
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.030
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

57
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.930
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

58
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.960
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

59
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.970
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

60
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.570
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

61
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.740
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths.
they don't know what's goin' on.

62
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.480
One minute. they're havin'
a Denver omelet. the next. someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

63
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.610
See. I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up. remember?

64
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.390
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

65
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.290
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now. that was a good idea.

66
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.760
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

67
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.130
- Yes. we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

68
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.860
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart. huh?

69
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.960
Pretty smart.

70
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.540
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now. right here.

71
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.110
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time. remember?

72
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.950
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

73
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.300
- I love you. Pumpkin.
- I love you. Honey Bunny.

74
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.000
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

75
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.940
Any of you fucking pricks move.

76
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.240
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

77
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.650
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

78
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.880
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

79
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.150
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

80
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.450
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

81
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.790
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie

82
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.920
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down

83
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.290
- Jungle boogie
- Get down and boogie

84
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.530
- Jungle boogie
- Shake it around

85
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.390
- Okay. so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay. what you want to know?

86
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300
- Hash is legal there. right?
- It's legal. but it ain't 100% legal.

87
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.000
You just can't walk into a restaurant.
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

88
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.400
I mean. they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

89
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.140
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

90
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.540
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

91
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.810
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar. it's legal to sell it.

92
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.280
It's illegal to carry it.
but-but that doesn't matter.
'cause get a load of this.

93
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.810
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam. it's illegal
for them to search you.

94
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.830
- I mean. that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh. man! I'm goin'.

95
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.420
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

96
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.430
I know. baby.
You'd dig it the most.

97
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.230
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?
- What?

98
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.240
It's the little differences.
I mean. they got the same shit
over there that they got here.

99
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.870
- but it's just there.
it's a little different.
- Example.

100
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.070
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

101
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.780
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

102
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.680
And in Paris. you can buy
a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...

103
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.250
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

104
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.520
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

105
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.390
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

106
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.370
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

107
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.900
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

108
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.900
What do they call a Big Mac?

109
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.270
Big Mac's a Big Mac.
but they call it Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.460
Le Big Mac.

111
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.710
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.

112
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.220
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?

113
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.270
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

114
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.650
- I seen 'em do it. man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
- Yuck.

115
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.620
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

116
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.360
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

117
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.020
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

118
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.500
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?
- It's possible.

119
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.930
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.

120
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.670
- What's her name?
- Mia.

121
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.940
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

122
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.610
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

123
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.170
Oh. really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

124
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.690
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

125
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.280
- Well. you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

126
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.990
Yeah. but you are aware that there
is an invention called television.

127
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.160
- and on this invention
they show shows. right?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.640
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

129
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.640
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

130
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.640
and on the strength of that
one show. they decide if
they wanna make more shows.

131
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.240
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some don't. become nothin'.

132
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.510
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

133
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.350
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?

134
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.250
Half-black. half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

135
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.720
- Yeah. maybe. Fat. right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

136
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.630
I mean. he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

137
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.130
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

138
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.430
Word 'round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

139
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.610
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No. no. no. no. no. Nothin' that bad.

140
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.380
- Well. then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

141
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.890
A foot massage?

142
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.020
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.030
Then what'd Marsellus do?

144
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.260
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

145
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.270
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

146
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.400
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass.
like a greenhouse.

147
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.740
Nigger fell through that.

148
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.750
Since then. he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

149
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.950
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

150
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.460
- But still. you play
with matches. you get burned.
- What do you mean?

151
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.690
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

152
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.230
You don't think he overreacted?

153
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.170
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did.
but he had to expect a reaction.

154
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.400
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

155
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.990
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

156
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.980
I mean. is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out? No. but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.

157
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.140
Whoa. stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

158
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.810
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

159
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.820
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

160
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.830
Now. look. maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

161
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.650
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...

162
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.990
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

163
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.930
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

164
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.090
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

165
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.830
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

166
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.140
Shit. yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

167
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.870
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

168
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.980
Fuck you.

169
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.140
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

170
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.480
- You know. I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo. yo. yo. man.

171
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.750
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

172
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.390
- This is the door.
- Yeah. it is.

173
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.790
What time you got?

174
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.990
7:22 in the a.m.

175
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.630
No. it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

176
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.980
Look. just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

177
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.250
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house.

178
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.050
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

179
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.360
Motherfucker do that shit to me.
he better paralyze my ass.
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

180
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:06.390
I ain't sayin' it's right.
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

181
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.100
Now. look. I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages.
and they all meant somethin'.

182
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.900
We act like they don't.
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.

183
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.070
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

184
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.370
where you don't talk about it.
but you know it and she knows it.

185
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:25.510
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

186
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.990
That's his fuckin' wife. man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

187
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.850
You know what I'm sayin'?

188
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.860
It's an interestin' point.

189
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.860
Come on.
Let's get into character.

190
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.810
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

191
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.900
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

192
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:54.210
He's goin' out of town. Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

193
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.240
- Take care of her?
- No. man. Just take her out.

194
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.690
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

195
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.280
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

196
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.990
It is not a date.

197
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.160
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.

198
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.760
It's just good company. that's all.

199
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.540
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

200
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.730
Hey. kids.
How you boys doin'?

201
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.480
Hey. keep chillin'.

202
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.440
You know who we are?

203
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.470
We're associates of your
business partner. Marsellus Wallace.

204
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.580
You do remember
your business partner. don't you?

205
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.230
Now. let me take
a wild guess here.

206
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.290
- You're Brett. right?
- Yeah.

207
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.700
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace.

208
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.600
don't ya. Brett?

209
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.330
Yeah. I remember.

210
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.740
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

211
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.440
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

212
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.480
Hamburgers.

213
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.650
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

214
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.320
What kind of hamburgers?

215
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.120
- Uh. ch-cheeseburgers.
- No. no. no.

216
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.290
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's. Wendy's. Jack-in-the-Box?

217
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.160
- Where?
- Uh. Big Kahuna Burger.

218
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.360
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

219
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.370
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

220
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.140
They're- They're good.

221
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.840
You mind if I try
one of yours?

222
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.350
- This is yours here. right?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.450
Mmmm.

224
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.650
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

225
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.250
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

226
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.790
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

227
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.300
- I ain't hungry.
- Well. if you like burgers.
give 'em a try sometime.

228
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.200
Me. I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian.

229
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.400
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

230
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.640
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

231
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.240
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

232
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.380
- No.
- Tell 'em. Vincent.

233
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.480
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

234
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.020
You know why they call it that?

235
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.160
Uh. because of
the metric system?

236
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.530
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

237
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.940
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

238
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.400
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

239
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.410
Sprite. Good.

240
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.350
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

241
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.280
Go right ahead.

242
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.560
That hit the spot.

243
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.690
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

244
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.300
- Why don't you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over-

245
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.970
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

246
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.480
You were sayin'?

247
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.610
It's in the cupboard.

248
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.360
N- No. the one
by your kn-knees.

249
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.530
We happy?

250
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.470
Vincent?

251
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.240
- We happy?
- Yeah. we happy.

252
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.610
Look. I'm sorry. uh. I-
I didn't get your name.

253
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.880
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B- But I never got yours.

254
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:26.290
- My name's Pitt. and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No. no. no.

255
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.700
I just want you
to know how-

256
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.820
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

257
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.100
with us and Mr. Wallace.

258
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.670
W- We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never-

259
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.140
Oh. I'm sorry.
did I break your concentration?

260
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.810
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

261
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:55.050
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

262
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.360
What's the matter?
Oh. you were finished!

263
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.160
Oh. well. allow me to retort.

264
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.690
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

265
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.960
What?

266
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.300
- What country you from?
- What?

267
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.640
- "What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What?
- W-What?

268
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.410
- English. motherfucker!
Do you speak it?
- Yes!

269
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.180
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

270
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.690
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

271
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.380
- What? I-
- Say "what" again!

272
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.390
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you. motherfucker!

273
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.360
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

274
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.760
- Go on!
- He's bald!

275
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.560
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

276
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.330
Does he look... Iike a bitch?

277
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.640
- No!
- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch?

278
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.340
- I didn't.
- Yes. you did. Yes. you did. Brett!

279
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.580
You tried to fuck him.- No. no.

280
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.920
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

281
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.050
- You read the Bible. Brett?
- Yes!

282
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.690
Well. there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.

283
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.100
Ezekiel 25:17.

284
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.470
"The path of the righteous man...

285
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.470
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

286
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.480
and the tyranny of evil men.

287
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.480
Blessed is he who.
in the name of charity and goodwill.

288
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.710
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness.

289
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.450
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

290
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.070
and the finder
of lost children.

291
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.950
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

292
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.000
and furious anger...

293
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.720
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

294
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.630
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

295
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.100
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

296
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.980
I think you gonna find...

297
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.720
when all this shit
is over and done-

298
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.760
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

299
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.130
The thing is. Butch.

300
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.230
right now...
you got ability.

301
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.340
But painful as it may be.

302
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.570
ability... don't last.

303
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.640
And your days are just about over.

304
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.120
Now. that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

305
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.220
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

306
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:04.590
You see. this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

307
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.630
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

308
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.070
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

309
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.580
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

310
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.220
Besides. Butch.

311
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.580
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

312
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.850
Hmm?

313
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.890
Two?

314
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.400
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

315
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.490
You came close.
but you never made it.

316
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.770
And if you were gonna make it.
you would have made it before now.

317
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.760
You my nigger?

318
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.830
Certainly appears so.

319
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.200
The night of the fight.
you may feel a slight sting.

320
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.710
That's pride fuckin' with you.

321
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.380
Fuck pride!

322
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.140
Pride only hurts.

323
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.150
It never helps.

324
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.620
You fight through that shit.

325
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:50.040
'Cause a year from now.
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean.

326
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:55.040
you gonna say to yourself.
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

327
00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.280
I got no problem
with that. Mr. Wallace.

328
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.150
In the fifth.
your ass goes down.

329
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.160
Say it.

330
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.860
In the fifth.
my ass goes down.

331
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.320
Yo. Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

332
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.860
Jules Winfield. our man in lnglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

333
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.770
- Goddamn. nigger.
what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

334
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.110
Where's the big man?

335
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.110
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

336
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.640
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave. go on over.

337
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.620
How ya been?

338
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.630
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?
- All right.

339
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.100
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

340
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.430
At Marsellus's request.

341
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.270
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

342
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.540
What's so fuckin' funny?

343
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.210
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

344
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.550
Look. I'm not a fuckin' idiot.
all right? It's the big man's wife.

345
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.280
I'm gonna sit across from her.
chew my food with my mouth closed.

346
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.320
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes.
and that's it.

347
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.520
Hey. my name's Paul.
and this shit's between y'all.

348
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.650
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

349
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.220
Asshole.

350
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.670
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

351
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.680
No.

352
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.410
- You lookin' at somethin'. friend?
- You ain't my friend. palooka.

353
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.010
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine. punchy.

354
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.680
Vincent Vega's in the house?

355
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.060
My nigger.

356
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.430
- What's up?
- Man. I'm really sorry.

357
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.670
You shouldn't worry about it.

358
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.710
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

359
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.550
And some matches.

360
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.590
Thanks.

361
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.780
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

362
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.750
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

363
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.220
That gun to pierce your ears.
they don't use that to pierce
your nipples. do they?

364
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.160
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

365
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.110
All my piercing. 18 places on my body.
every one of 'em done with a needle.

366
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.660
Five in each ear. one through
the nipple of my left breast.

367
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.870
two in my right nostril.
one in my left eyebrow.

368
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.810
one in my belly.
one in my lip. one in my clit.

369
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.340
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

370
00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.350
I was just curious.

371
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.280
but. um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

372
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.850
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

373
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.880
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

374
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.730
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

375
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.240
Now. that's Bava.
Different. but equally good.

376
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.240
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

377
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:32.750
Now. the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

378
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.780
But this one
is a little more expensive.

379
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.250
This is 500 a gram.

380
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.720
But. when you shoot it. you will know
where that extra money went.

381
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.890
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real. real. real good shit.

382
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.620
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

383
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.460
Remember. I just got back
from Amsterdam.

384
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.560
Am I a nigger?
Are we in lnglewood? No.

385
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.800
You're in my home. Now. white people
who know the difference...

386
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.870
between good shit and bad shit.
this is the house they come to.

387
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.310
Now. my shit. I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

388
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.680
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

389
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.620
This ain't Amsterdam. Vince.
This is a seller's market.

390
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.680
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

391
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.630
Heroin. it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

392
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.360
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

393
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.870
Now. if it's as good as you say it is.
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

394
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.700
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya.

395
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.970
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

396
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.210
That is what a nice guy I am.

397
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.380
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah. that's cool.

398
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.440
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

399
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.460
Honey. will you get me some baggies
and. uh. twistix from the kitchen?

400
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.490
Okay.

401
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.090
Hey. uh. what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

402
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.460
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

403
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:03.700
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No. that's Jody.

404
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.210
That's my wife.

405
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.870
- I'm sorry. man.
- Thank you.

406
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.810
- No. I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right. no problemo.

407
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.610
I'll take a rain check.

408
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.010
- Oh.
- Thank you. Jody.

409
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.390
Still got your Malibu?

410
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.550
Oh. man. you know what some fucker
did the other day?

411
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.560
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

412
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.220
- Oh. man. that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

413
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.000
I had it in storage
for three years.

414
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:40.400
It was out five days. and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

415
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.900
They should be fuckin' killed.
man. No trial. no jury.
straight to execution.

416
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.700
I wish I could've caught him
doin' it. I'd have given
anything to catch that asshole.

417
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:54.510
- It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker!

418
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.380
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

419
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.350
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

420
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.820
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

421
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.050
Thank you.

422
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.920
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey. mi casa es su casa.

423
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.290
Muchas gracias.

424
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.330
Hi. Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

425
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.600
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

426
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.480
Hello?

427
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:18.040
Billy Raye was a preacher's son
and when his daddy would visit
he'd come along

428
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.250
Vincent.

429
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.820
Vincent.

430
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.830
I'm on the intercom.

431
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.520
Where is-
Where is the intercom?

432
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.920
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

433
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.090
To your right.

434
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.320
Warm.

435
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.500
Warmer.

436
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.560
Disco.

437
00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.230
Hello?

438
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.640
Push the button
if you want to talk.

439
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.770
Hello?

440
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:56.680
Go make yourself a drink. and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

441
00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.150
The bar's by the fireplace.

442
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.080
Okay.

443
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.590
When he started
sweet talkin' to me

444
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.420
He come and tell me
everything is all right

445
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.160
He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right

446
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.170
Can I get away
again tonight

447
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.830
The only one who could
ever reach me

448
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.530
Was the son
of a preacher man

449
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.670
The only boy
who could ever teach me

450
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.710
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes. he was

451
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.080
He was

452
00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.780
- Lord he knows he was
- Yes he was

453
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.850
How will I remember

454
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.650
The look was in his eyes

455
00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.220
Stealing kisses from me
on the sly

456
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.890
Taking time to make time

457
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.450
Telling me that
he's all mine

458
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.470
Learning from each other's knowin'

459
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.630
Looking to see
how much we've grown

460
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.170
And the only one
who could ever reach me

461
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.500
Was the son
of a preacher man

462
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.550
The only boy
who could ever teach me

463
00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.980
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes. he was

464
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.850
- Was. was
- He was

465
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.610
Oh. yes he was

466
00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.520
Let's go.

467
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.130
What the fuck is this place?

468
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.690
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

469
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.100
An Elvis man should love it.

470
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:27.370
- Come on. Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here. daddy-o.

471
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.240
Don't be a-

472
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.750
Oh. after you. kitty-cat.

473
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.970
Good evening. ladies and gentlemen.

Call for...

501
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.160
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?

502
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:46.930
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

503
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.840
Hi. I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

504
00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.710
Let's see. steak. steak. steak. Oh.
yeah. I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

505
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.580
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?

506
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:03.950
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell. and-

507
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.750
Oh. yeah. look at this-
vanilla Coke.

508
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.790
What about you. Peggy Sue?

509
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.190
I'll have the...

510
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.600
Durward Kirby burger. bloody.

511
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.570
And... a five-dollar shake.

512
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.370
How do you want that shake.
Martin and Lewis. or Amos 'n Andy?

513
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.570
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order
a five-dollar shake?

514
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.700
Mm-hmm.

515
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.940
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

516
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.420
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?

517
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.850
- No.
- Just checking.

518
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.620
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

519
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.630
To Lonesome Town

520
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.650
To cry my troubles away

521
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:54.330
Could you. um...
roll me one of those. cowboy?

522
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.270
You can have this one. cowgirl.

523
00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.270
Thanks.

524
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.740
The streets are filled
with regret

525
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.040
Think nothin' of it.

526
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.950
Lay me down
in Lonesome Town

527
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.550
- I can learn to forget
- So...

528
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.710
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

529
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.920
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

530
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.520
Just over three years.

531
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.900
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

532
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.690
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.

533
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.700
Why would you?

534
00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.310
I heard you did a pilot.

535
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.270
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

536
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.050
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

537
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.850
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

538
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.180
Fox. as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

539
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.720
Force. as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

540
00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.560
And five. as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

541
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.320
There was a blond one.
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

542
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.530
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

543
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.660
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

544
00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.610
French fox's speciality was sex.

545
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.040
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

546
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.150
The character I played.
Raven McCoy.

547
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.080
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

548
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.420
According to the show.
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

549
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:33.250
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

550
00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.450
Her grandfather.
an old vaudevillian. taught her.

551
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.830
And if we would have got picked up.
they would've worked in a gimmick...

552
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.770
where every show
I would've told another joke.

553
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.730
You know any of them old jokes?

554
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.540
Well. I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

555
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.170
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

556
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.170
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

557
00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.950
- No. you wouldn't like it.
and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr-

558
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.960
You told 50 million people.
and you can't tell me?

559
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.890
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of. Vince.

560
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.290
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

561
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.800
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

562
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.460
What a gyp.

563
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.000
Martin and Lewis.

564
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.480
Vanilla Coke.

565
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.150
Mmm. Yummy.

566
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.190
You think I could
have a sip of that?

567
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.890
Be my guest.

568
00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.990
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

569
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.520
- You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah. but maybe I do.

570
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.470
Cooties I can handle.

571
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.510
All right.

572
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.380
Goddamn. that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

573
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.510
- Told ya.
- I don't know if it was worth $5.
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

574
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.970
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

575
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.380
Uncomfortable silences.

576
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:55.910
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

577
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.930
I don't know.
That's a good question.

578
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.730
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

579
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.500
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

580
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.670
Well. I don't think we're quite
there yet. but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

581
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.300
I'll tell you what.

582
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.640
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

583
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.910
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

584
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.090
I'll do that.

585
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.360
Okay.

586
00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.810
I said goddamn!

587
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:03.050
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

588
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.250
I need some hair spray.

589
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.090
Mmmm.

590
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:20.500
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you?

591
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.970
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

592
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.170
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

593
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.380
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

594
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.510
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No. there's not.

595
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.920
That is Marilyn Monroe.

596
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.720
That is Mamie Van Doren.

597
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.730
I don't see Jayne Mansfield.
so she must have the night off.

598
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.230
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

599
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.670
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually. I did.

600
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.270
However...

601
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.000
you seem like
a really nice person. and I-

602
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.910
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

603
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:07.180
This doesn't sound like
the usual. mindless. boring.
gettin'- to-know-you chitchat.

604
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.250
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

605
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.160
Well. well. I do. I do.

606
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:17.290
- But you have
to promise not to be offended.
- No. no.

607
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:21.590
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

608
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:26.540
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me. and my natural response
could be to get offended.

609
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.960
Then. through no fault of my own.
I would have broken my promise.

610
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.740
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

611
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:35.860
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.

612
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.140
- Is that a fact?
- And besides.

613
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:43.240
- isn't it more. uh. exciting
when you don't have permission?
- All right. all right.

614
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.110
Well. here goes.

615
00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.210
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

616
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.720
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

617
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:56.020
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

618
00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:00.790
Well. that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

619
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:04.030
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

620
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.230
Yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

621
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:11.740
- Is that a fact?
- No.

622
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.940
No. it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

623
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.910
- Who told you?
- They.

624
00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.450
"They" talk a lot. don't they?

625
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.280
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

626
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.760
- Don't be shy. Vincent.
What else did "they" say?
- I'm- I'm not shy.

627
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.350
- Um-
- Did it involve the "F" word?

628
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.420
No. no. no. no. no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

629
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.600
- And?
- And- And nothin'.

630
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.540
That's it.

631
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.670
You heard Marsellus...

632
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:50.110
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

633
00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.120
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

634
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:56.710
Well. at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

635
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.880
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

636
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.020
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

637
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.550
No. it seemed excessive.
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

638
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.290
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

639
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.000
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

640
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.800
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

641
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.470
But did it happen?

642
00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:26.380
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it... at my wedding.

643
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.850
Really?

644
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.250
Truth is. nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

645
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.260
except Marsellus and Tony.

646
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:38.320
When you little scamps get together.
you're worse than a sewing circle.

647
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:42.330
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

648
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.430
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

649
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.170
Now. this is where
one lucky couple...

650
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:58.710
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

651
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.340
Now. who will be
our first contestants?

652
00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.680
- Right here!
- All right!

653
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.770
- I wanna dance.
- No. no. no. no. no.

654
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:12.590
No. no. no. no. no. I do believe
Marsellus. my husband. your boss.

655
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.090
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

656
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:19.850
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

657
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.480
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

658
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.510
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

659
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:35.390
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.
Young lady. what is your name?

660
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.440
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

661
00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.150
And how 'bout your fella here?

662
00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.050
Vincent Vega.

663
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.560
All right. let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

664
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.560
- Go for it.
- Come on!

665
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:10.810
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

666
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.780
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

667
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.960
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

668
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.230
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

669
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:35.270
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale

670
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.450
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

671
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.220
But when Pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well

672
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:53.590
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

673
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.670
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

674
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.970
Seven hundred little records
all rock. rhythm and jazz

675
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.810
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

676
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:18.780
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

677
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.510
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

678
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.510
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

679
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.910
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

680
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.350
I don't know
what you call that.

681
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.050
Drinks! Music!

682
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.290
I'm gonna take a piss.

683
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:47.320
That's a little bit more information
than I needed. but go right ahead.

684
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.310
Girl

685
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.250
Bomp. bomp. bom

686
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.810
You'll be a woman soon

687
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.460
I love you so much
Can't count all the ways

688
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.520
I'd die for you. girl
and all they can say is

689
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.790
He's not your kind

690
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:25.100
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

691
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.540
What I'm gonna find

692
00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.700
Don't let them
make up your mind

693
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.640
Don't you know. girl

694
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.640
You'll be a woman soon

695
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.810
One drink. and that's it.

696
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:46.720
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink. but do it quickly.

697
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.760
Say good night...
and go home.

698
00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:57.300
You'll be a woman soon

699
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.560
Soon

700
00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:05.110
You'll be a woman

701
00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.580
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

702
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.980
But what they're sayin'. girl
it cuts like a knife

703
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.420
The boy's no good

704
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:17.180
Well. I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for

705
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.660
But if they get a chance
they'll end it for sure
Sure they would

706
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:24.420
Baby. I've done
all I could

707
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:29.160
You see. this is
a moral test of oneself.

708
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.500
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

709
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.870
Because... being loyal
is very important.

710
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:40.540
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

711
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.240
What I'm gonna find

712
00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.270
Don't let them
make up your mind

713
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:50.190
Don't you know. girl

714
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.620
You'll be a woman soon

715
00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.100
Please

716
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.450
Come take my hand

717
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.540
Girl

718
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:12.810
You'll be a woman soon

719
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:16.150
Please

720
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.370
Come take my hand

721
00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:23.050
Girl

722
00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.010
Hello

723
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:29.520
So. you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say. "Good night.

724
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:32.120
I've had a very lovely evening."

725
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.250
Walk out the door. get in
the car. go home. jerk off.
and that's all you gonna do.

726
00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:45.030
Now it's up to you. girl

727
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.730
You'll be a woman soon

728
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:55.310
Please

729
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.010
Come take my hand

730
00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.880
Girl

731
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:07.650
You'll be a woman soon

732
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.330
Soon

733
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:15.490
You'll be a woman

734
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.370
All right. Mia.

735
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.540
So listen. I gotta go.
all right?

736
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.050
Oh. Jesus fucking Christ.

737
00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.850
You fu-
Oh. Jesus Christ!

738
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.220
Oh. fuck me.
Fuck me!

739
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:46.980
Oh- Come on. girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

740
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.850
Don't fuckin' die on me. Mia!

741
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.860
Fuck!

742
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:10.970
Answer.

743
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.470
Have you got the ring?

744
00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.370
- Why. certainly.
- Join hands. you two lovebirds.

745
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.880
Please! Please!

746
00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.610
Yes. yes.
Hold hands. you lovebirds.

747
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.010
Fuck you. Lance!
Answer!

748
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:38.030
Now what do you say?

749
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.030
I give up!
I'll marry you!

750
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:45.760
- Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

751
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.410
I can hear it.

752
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:52.910
I thought you told those
fuckin' assholes never to
call here this late!

753
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.910
Yeah. I told them.

754
00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.240
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

755
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.650
- Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.

756
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.980
Lance! Vincent.

757
00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.990
I'm in big fuckin' trouble. man.
I'm coming to your house.

758
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.140
W- Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses. man.
W- What's the problem?

759
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:15.480
- I got this chick.
she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well. don't bring her here!

760
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:19.890
I'm not even joking with you!
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

761
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:22.020
- No choice.
- Wh- She's O.D.in'?

762
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.290
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me. man!
- Just dandy.

763
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.560
Okay. then you bite
the fuckin' bullet. take her
to a hospital and call a lawyer.

764
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.070
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem. man!

765
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:35.870
You fucked her up.
you fuckin' deal with this!

766
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.780
Uh. are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

767
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.280
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

768
00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.680
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

769
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.700
What the hell was that?

770
00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.100
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

771
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:03.100
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance. help me.

772
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:06.110
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

773
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:09.610
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

774
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.610
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

775
00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.110
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

776
00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:18.120
If she croaks on me.
I am a fucking grease spot!

777
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:22.780
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help and
let her die on your lawn.

778
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.790
Now. come on. Help me. help me.
Pick her up.

779
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.790
Shit.

780
00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.230
Lance!

781
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.230
Shit.

782
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.740
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

783
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:41.140
What the fuck's going on out here?

784
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:43.140
Who's she?

785
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:46.150
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

786
00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:48.270
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

787
00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:50.410
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

788
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.010
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

789
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:56.020
Just keep talking to her.
all right?

790
00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:59.020
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

791
00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:01.080
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

792
00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.100
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!

793
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.600
I don't go joy-poppin'
with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

794
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.100
- Get the shot!
- I am. if you'll let me!

795
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:12.100
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!

796
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.110
- Get the shot!
- All right!

797
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.710
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

798
00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.720
What's he looking for?

799
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.720
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

800
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:28.720
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

801
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:32.890
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

802
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.900
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

803
00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.900
- If it's so important.
why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!

804
00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:42.900
- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking. that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.

805
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.900
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

806
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:48.870
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!
- Lance. get in here!

807
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:53.170
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

808
00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.680
- Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this.

809
00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:00.080
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

810
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:03.700
- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart.
so it's gotta be exact.

811
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:06.730
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

812
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:10.450
- That's it.
- All right. what I need is
a big. fat magic marker.

813
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.460
- You got it?
- What?

814
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:15.230
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

815
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.920
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

816
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:23.060
- Come on. man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay. okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

817
00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:28.740
- Hurry up. man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

818
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.740
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No. you're gonna give her the shot.

819
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.740
- I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.
- I never done this either!

820
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.800
I ain't starting now!
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

821
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.280
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house. then I give her the shot.

822
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.290
Give it to me.
Give me that.

823
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.290
All right. tell me what to do.

824
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.350
Okay. you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

825
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:52.360
- But she's got a breastplate-
You gotta pierce through that.

826
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.360
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

827
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.870
- I gotta- I gotta
stab her three times?
- No. just stab her once!

828
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.370
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

829
01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.370
Once you do that.
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

830
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.930
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

831
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:10.950
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

832
01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.450
- She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's-
- All right. count to three.

833
01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.710
- All right. Ready?
- One.

834
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:23.520
Two.

835
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.470
Three!

836
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:51.320
If you're all right.
then say something.

837
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.410
Something.

838
01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:56.430
That was fuckin' trippy.

839
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.330
- Ohh.
- Oh. man.

840
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.960
Mia. Mia.

841
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.560
What's-

842
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.430
What's your thoughts on- on-

843
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.530
on how to handle this?

844
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.540
What's yours?

845
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.510
Well. I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life.

846
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.580
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

847
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:54.510
If Marsellus knew
about this incident.

848
01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.640
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

849
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.210
I seriously doubt that.

850
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.220
I can keep a secret if you can.

851
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.190
Shake on it?

852
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.690
Mum's the word?

853
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.690
Cool.

854
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:20.090
Now. if you'll excuse me. I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

855
01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.760
Vincent.

856
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.660
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

857
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.670
Sure.

858
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.770
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

859
01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.780
No. you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

860
01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.180
But if you still wanna hear it.
I'll tell it.

861
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.440
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

862
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.390
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

863
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:49.890
Papa Tomato. Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

864
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.120
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind.
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

865
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:57.130
Goes back and squishes him
and says.

866
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.290
"Ketchup."

867
01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.070
Ketchup.

868
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.340
See you around.

869
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.100
Oh. that Paddlefoot.
He funny. silly dog.

870
01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:38.100
He think totem pole alive!

871
01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:40.900
He arctic tenderfoot!

872
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:44.640
That totem pole been here forever!

873
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.650
Butch?

874
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.580
One more thing. and we'll start for-

875
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:52.590
- Butch. stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

876
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:56.280
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

877
01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:04.000
Now. do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

878
01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.800
Well. this here is Captain Koons.

879
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:10.800
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

880
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.080
Hello. little man.

881
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.240
Boy. I sure heard
a bunch about you.

882
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.550
See. I was a good friend
of your dad's.

883
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.650
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

884
01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.190
over five years.

885
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.190
Hopefully...

886
01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.200
you'll never have to
experience this yourself.

887
01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.700
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

888
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.570
for as long as we were.

889
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.940
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

890
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.940
If it'd been me who'd-

891
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.210
not made it.

892
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.550
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

893
01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:00.280
But the way it turned out.
I'm talking to you.

894
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.620
Butch...

895
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.090
I got something for ya.

896
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.660
This watch I got here...

897
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.530
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

898
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:25.270
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville. Tennessee.

899
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:28.900
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

900
01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.910
Up 'til then. people just
carried pocket watches.

901
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:35.140
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

902
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:38.150
on the day he set sail for Paris.

903
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.650
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch.

904
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:44.080
and he wore it every day
he was in that war. and...

905
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.720
when he'd done his duty.
he went home to your great-grandmother.

906
01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:52.230
took the watch off.
put it in an old coffee can.
and in that can it stayed...

907
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.730
until your granddad. Dane Coolidge.
was called upon by his country...

908
01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.530
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

909
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.060
This time they called it
World War II.

910
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.140
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

911
01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:12.210
Unfortunately. Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

912
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.220
Dane was a Marine.
and he was killed...

913
01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:19.310
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

914
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:22.320
Your granddad was facing death.

915
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:24.330
He knew it.

916
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:28.330
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive.

917
01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.600
so three days before the Japanese
took the island.

918
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:36.900
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport.
name of Winocki-

919
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.910
a man he'd never met before
in his life-

920
01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.950
to deliver to his infant son.

921
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:47.610
who he'd never seen in the flesh.
his gold watch.

922
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.020
Three days later. your granddad
was dead. but Winocki kept his word.

923
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:56.360
After the war was over.
he paid a visit to your grandmother.

924
01:06:56.430 --> 01:07:00.660
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

925
01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.670
This watch.

926
01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:13.980
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

927
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.480
He was captured.
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

928
01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:21.610
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch.

929
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:25.210
it'd be confiscated.
taken away.

930
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:28.990
The way your dad looked at it.
this watch was your birthright.

931
01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.000
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy. yellow
hands on his boy's birthright.

932
01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:37.000
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something- his ass.

933
01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:40.500
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

934
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:44.770
Then he died of dysentery-
He give me the watch.

935
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.710
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

936
01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.710
Then...

937
01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.840
after seven years.
I was sent home to my family and...

938
01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.850
now...

939
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:02.220
Iittle man.
I give the watch to you.

940
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.010
It's time. Butch.

941
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.680
ln the heavyweight division.

942
01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:40.910
- in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks.

943
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:44.250
weighing 210 pounds.

944
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.450
Floyd Ray Wilson!

945
01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:52.460
It's official. It's official.

946
01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:55.470
- Wilson is dead!
- Well. Dan.
that had to be the bloodiest.

947
01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.970
hands down. the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

948
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.630
Coolidge was out of there
faster than I've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.

949
01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:04.640
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.

950
01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:08.150
I could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

951
01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:11.650
- I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...

952
01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.650
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?

953
01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.660
A tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations.

954
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.660
It's of paramount importance.
during the sad weeks ahead.
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain-

955
01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.830
Man. you know I didn't-

956
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.830
- Marsellus.
- No. it wasn't. I didn't do it.

957
01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.840
I didn't do it.

958
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.400
- How you doing?
- Great.

959
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.910
I never thanked you
for dinner.

960
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:12.750
- What you got?
- He booked.

961
01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.910
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

962
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.420
- I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.
- No. we don't wanna "think."

963
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:23.080
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel. sic the dogs on his ass.

964
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.590
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

965
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.590
Butch's search-
How do you want it done?

966
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.600
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

967
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:35.100
If Butch goes to lndochina. I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

968
01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.300
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

969
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:39.510
I will take care of it.

970
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.620
Mister.

971
01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.010
- Hey. mister.
- What?

972
01:10:57.090 --> 01:11:01.890
You were in that fight.
the fight on the radio.

973
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.400
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

974
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:08.230
No. come on.

975
01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.240
You're him.

976
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:12.740
I know you're him.

977
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.370
Tell me you're him.

978
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.380
I'm him.

979
01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.910
You killed the other boxing man.

980
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:27.640
He's dead?

981
01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:30.150
The radio said he was dead.

982
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:35.150
Sorry about that. Floyd.

983
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:38.950
What does it feel like?

984
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.960
What does what feel like?

985
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.960
Killing a man.

986
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:48.790
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

987
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.800
What are you. a weirdo?

988
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:52.800
No.

989
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:56.310
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

990
01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.810
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

991
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.750
So?

992
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.080
What does it feel like to kill a man?

993
01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:13.120
I'll tell you what.

994
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:17.130
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there. and I'll
tell you all about it.

995
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:38.080
So. Esmarelda...

996
01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:42.790
Villa Lobos-
Is that Mexican?

997
01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:46.090
The name is Spanish.
but I am Colombian.

998
01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.460
- That's some handle
you got there. honey.
- Thank you.

999
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.460
And what is your name?

1000
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:53.220
Butch.

1001
01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.770
Butch.

1002
01:12:55.830 --> 01:13:00.600
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American. honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1003
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:03.330
So. moving right along.

1004
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:05.340
Esmarelda.

1005
01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.670
what is it you want to know?

1006
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:12.610
- I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1007
01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.960
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1008
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:27.620
Now that I know he's dead.
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1009
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:34.810
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1010
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.220
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1011
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:52.220
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in. man. the odds
went through the roof.

1012
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:54.490
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1013
01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.990
Hey. fuck him. Scotty. If he was
a better boxer. he'd still be alive.

1014
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.000
If he never
laced up his gloves.

1015
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.500
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place. he'd still be alive.

1016
01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:08.150
Yeah. well. who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1017
01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.160
Yeah. well. enough about the poor.
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1018
01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.930
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1019
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.950
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1020
01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.450
All eight?
How long to collect?

1021
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:25.010
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No. I understand.

1022
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.240
A few stragglers aside.
Oh. fuck. Scotty. that is good news.

1023
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.550
That is great news. man.

1024
01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.820
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No. me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1025
01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:38.150
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1026
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:40.160
Okay. my brother.

1027
01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:42.200
You're right.

1028
01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.600
You're goddamn right.

1029
01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:48.160
All right. Scotty. next time I see you.
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1030
01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.570
Cool. brother.

1031
01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.150
$45.60.

1032
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.660
And. uh.

1033
01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:17.030
here's a little something
for the effort.

1034
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:21.030
Now. if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight. what are you gonna say?

1035
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.040
The truth.

1036
01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.600
Three well-dressed.
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1037
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:30.910
Bonsoir.
Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1038
01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.500
Buenas Noches. Butch.

1039
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.560
Whew.

1040
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:49.920
Keep the light off.

1041
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.930
- Is that better. Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1042
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:59.340
Hard day at the office?

1043
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.340
Pretty hard.

1044
01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:03.640
Got in a fight.

1045
01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:05.870
Poor baby.

1046
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:08.510
Can you make spoons?

1047
01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:11.520
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1048
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:15.520
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1049
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:18.020
Let me take this jacket off.

1050
01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:23.720
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1051
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.730
I wish I had a pot.

1052
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.440
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror.
and you wish you had some pot?

1053
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:34.440
A pot.
A pot belly.

1054
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:36.670
Pot bellies are sexy.

1055
01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.040
Well. you should be happy.

1056
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:41.050
'cause you have one.

1057
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.570
Shut up. fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1058
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:48.520
I have a bit of a tummy.
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1059
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:50.520
It's not the same thing.

1060
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:54.520
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.

1061
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.530
The difference is huge.

1062
01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.020
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1063
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.040
No.

1064
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:06.530
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1065
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:09.690
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1066
01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:15.210
The rest of you is normal- normal face.
normal legs. normal hips. normal ass-

1067
01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.330
but with a big.
perfectly round pot belly.

1068
01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.350
If I had one. I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1069
01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.350
to accentuate it.

1070
01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.850
You think men
would find that attractive?

1071
01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.080
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1072
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.610
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1073
01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.630
is seldom the same.

1074
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:42.630
If you had a pot belly.
I would punch you in it.

1075
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.640
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1076
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.640
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1077
01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:51.640
- I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1078
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:53.640
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1079
01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:55.680
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1080
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.120
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1081
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:05.790
Oh.

1082
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:11.160
Did you get everything?

1083
01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:14.220
- Yes. I did.
- Good job. Sugar Pop.

1084
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.230
Did everything
go as planned?

1085
01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.030
You didn't listen to the- Ow!

1086
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.040
You didn't listen to the radio?

1087
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:24.400
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1088
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.770
I won. all right.

1089
01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.810
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1090
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.250
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1091
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.120
We're not at the finish yet. baby.

1092
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.930
We're in a lot of danger.
aren't we?

1093
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.440
If they find us.
they'll kill us. won't they?

1094
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.440
But they won't find us.
will they?

1095
01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.280
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1096
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:08.510
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's-

1097
01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:17.490
Say it.

1098
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.160
Fabienne.

1099
01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:23.360
I want you to be with me.

1100
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:26.430
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1101
01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:30.540
Do you love me?

1102
01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:32.600
Very. very much.

1103
01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.880
- Butch.
- Yes?

1104
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.910
Will you give me
oral pleasure?

1105
01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:48.360
Will you kiss it?

1106
01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:52.490
But you first.

1107
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

1108
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:07.910
Butch.

1109
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.400
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1110
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.500
I think I cracked a rib.

1111
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:33.000
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No. retard. from the fight.

1112
01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.500
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.

1113
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:39.060
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1114
01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.070
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi-

1115
01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:44.080
Shut up. fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1116
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:47.240
Okay. okay.
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

1117
01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.250
I take it back.

1118
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:55.190
Will you hand me a dry towel.
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1119
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.190
- Oh. I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1120
01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.690
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1121
01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.700
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1122
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.890
And I took it back.

1123
01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:09.060
Butch?

1124
01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:11.070
Yes. Lemon Pie?

1125
01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:14.570
- Where are we going to go?
- Well. I'm not sure yet.

1126
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.770
Wherever you want.

1127
01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.780
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this.

1128
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:22.780
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1129
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:25.790
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1130
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:29.790
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1131
01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:33.290
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1132
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.300
- If we wanted.
we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1133
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.800
And if after a while you didn't
dig that. we could go someplace else.

1134
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:41.800
Maybe Tahiti. Mexico.

1135
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:43.800
But I do not speak Spanish.

1136
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:46.840
Well. you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1137
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:48.880
Besides. Mexican's easy.

1138
01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.880
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?

1139
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:53.880
Where is the shoe store?

1140
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:55.880
- ¿Donde esta-
- Spit. please.

1141
01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:01.220
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1142
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:03.310
Mmm.

1143
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:06.690
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1144
01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.290
- ¿Que hora es?
- ¿Que hora es?

1145
01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.520
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1146
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.230
Time for bed.

1147
01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:16.240
Sweet dreams. jellybean.

1148
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:25.880
Butch?

1149
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:33.720
Never mind.

1150
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.320
Aah!

1151
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.460
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1152
01:22:57.910 --> 01:23:02.170
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1153
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:04.180
I'm not sure the name.

1154
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:09.170
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1155
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:15.080
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1156
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:22.360
- What was it about?
- How should I know?
You were the one watching it.

1157
01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.420
- No. imbecile.
what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1158
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:28.430
I don't remember.

1159
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:31.430
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1160
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:34.470
Well. let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1161
01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:39.480
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1162
01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:42.170
One more kiss.
and I'll get up.

1163
01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.550
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1164
01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:51.050
- Get up. lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1165
01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.180
Ohh. God.

1166
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:59.020
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1167
01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:02.860
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1168
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:07.300
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?
- What. Lemon Pie?

1169
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:11.500
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1170
01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.510
with maple syrup.

1171
01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:17.010
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1172
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.280
Anything to drink with that?

1173
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:23.010
Wow. that looks nice.

1174
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:26.420
To drink- A tall glass
of orange juice...

1175
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:28.920
and a black cup of coffee.

1176
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:33.560
- After that. I'm going to
have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1177
01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:37.570
- Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1178
01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.570
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1179
01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.630
And on top. a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1180
01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:45.640
Where's my watch?

1181
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:52.380
It's there.

1182
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:55.040
- No. it's not.
- Have you looked?

1183
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.390
Yes. I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1184
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.580
You sure you got it?

1185
01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:03.960
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1186
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:07.190
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes. it was on the little kangaroo.

1187
01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.430
Yeah. well.
it's not here now.

1188
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.370
Well. it should be.

1189
01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.240
Yes. it most definitely should be.
but it's not here now!
So where the fuck is it?

1190
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:26.250
Fabienne.
where's my father's fucking watch?

1191
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.360
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1192
01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:35.360
I don't have time to go into it.
but he went through a lot.

1193
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:40.760
All this other shit you could've set
on fire. but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.

1194
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:42.160
Now think.

1195
01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:45.760
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1196
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:49.090
"You believe so"?
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.

1197
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:52.440
Then I did.

1198
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:55.750
Are you sure?

1199
01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:58.780
No.

1200
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:02.810
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1201
01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:05.250
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'-

1202
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.960
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1203
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:11.950
No!

1204
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.520
It's not your fault.

1205
01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.760
You left it at the apartment.

1206
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:32.770
If you left it at the apartment.
it's not your fault.

1207
01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.970
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1208
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.120
I reminded you about it.

1209
01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.950
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1210
01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:51.050
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch. I shoulda told you that.

1211
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:53.560
You're not a mind reader.

1212
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.560
Are you?

1213
01:27:05.710 --> 01:27:07.640
I- I'm sorry.

1214
01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:11.300
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1215
01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.070
Why does it mean that?

1216
01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:19.980
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1217
01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:23.710
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1218
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:28.060
Well. that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1219
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:31.360
If they are. and I don't think
I can handle it.

1220
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:33.370
then I'll split.

1221
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:37.730
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1222
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:46.070
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1223
01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:48.010
Have a nice breakfast.

1224
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.520
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1225
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.020
Blueberry pie.

1226
01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:56.250
Maybe not that fast.

1227
01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.520
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1228
01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:01.930
- Bye.
- Bye.

1229
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.930
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget.

1230
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.930
she forgets my father's watch!

1231
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.940
I specifically reminded her-

1232
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.130
bedside table. on the kangaroo.

1233
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:14.470
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1234
01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.390
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's
nearest you...

1235
01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:47.700

Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1240
01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:04.980
That's how you're gonna

1241
01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.250

watchin' Captain Kangaroo

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.820
That don't bother me at all

1246
01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:24.430
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn

- Oh. my God.
- He's dead.

That guy was a drunken maniac.

1259
01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.410
He hit you. then he
crashed into that car.

1260
01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:17.410

- Him.

1261

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.340
Then how come they're all beat up?

1297
01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.670
They did that to each other. man.
They came in fightin'.

1298
01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:01.080
Now. this 'un right here.
he was gonna shoot that one.

1299
01:39:01.150 --> 01:39:04.510
Is that right?
You gonna shoot him. boy?

1300
01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.180
Huh?

1301
01:39:09.190 --> 01:39:12.250
Hey. is Grace
all right out front?

1302
01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.550
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday. is it?
- No. it's Thursday.

1303
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:18.220
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.

1304
01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:23.960
Well. bring out the Gimp.

1305
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:27.800
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1306
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.810
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now. won't you?

1307
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.850
Get up.

1308
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:28.070
Get down.

1309
01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.080
Which one of 'em
you wanna do first?

1310
01:40:41.150 --> 01:40:44.880
I ain't for sure yet.

1311
01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.080
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1312
01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.750
catch a nigger...

1313
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:56.410
by his toe.

1314
01:40:56.490 --> 01:41:00.250
If he hollers. let him go.

1315
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:04.450
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1316
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:10.360
My mother said...

1317
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:14.030
pick the perfect one.

1318
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.090
and... you... are...

1319
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:20.470
it.

1320
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:25.870
- Guess that means you. big boy.
- Fuck you!

1321
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:28.420
Shh.

1322
01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:34.780
- You wanna do it in here?
- No. let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1323
01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.590
Sounds good to me.

1324
01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:04.610
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1325
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.040
Yeah!

1326
01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:40.820
Now! Go! Come on. motherfucker!

1327
01:42:40.890 --> 01:42:44.330

Come on! Yeah!

1329
01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:06.970
- Ohh!

1330
01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:12.850
Yeah! Yeah!

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.270
Come on!
Get down there!

1334
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:17.140
Aaah!
Do it! Yeah!

1335
01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:37.250
Yeah! Yeah!

1336
01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.880
Shut the fuck up!

1337
01:44:57.650 --> 01:44:59.580
Fuck him!

1338
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:03.690
Come on!

1339
01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:10.730
Fuck him. Yeah.

1340
01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:23.350
Aaaaah!

1341
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:30.450

1342
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:43.700
You want that gun.

1343
01:45:45.370 --> 01:45:47.310
Huh?

1344
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:50.240
Go ahead and pick it up.

1345
01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:54.980
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1346
01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:59.740
Come on-
Thatta boy!

1347
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.420
I want you to pick it up. Zed.

1348
01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:12.720
Step aside. Butch.

1349
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:28.010
Fuck!

1350
01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:33.550
You okay?

1351
01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.080
No. man.

1352
01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:40.090
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1353
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:54.210
What now?

1354
01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.480
"What now"?

1355
01:46:59.850 --> 01:47:03.270
Let me tell you what now.

1356
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:06.280
I'm gonna call a couple of hard.
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1357
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:09.280
to go to work
on the homes here...

1358
01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.280
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1359
01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.950
You hear me talkin'.
hillbilly boy?

1360
01:47:18.230 --> 01:47:20.780
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1361
01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:23.790
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1362
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:30.000
I meant what now
between me and you.

1363
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:37.470
Oh. that "what now."

1364
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:42.850
- I tell you what now
between me and you.

1365
01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:47.350
There is no me and you.

1366
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:50.720
Not no more.

1367
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:55.730
So. are we cool?

1368
01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.390
Yeah. we cool.

1369
01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.590
Two things.

1370
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:06.300
Don't tell nobody about this.

1371
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:11.400
This shit is between me. you...

1372
01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:15.940
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1373
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:17.950
rapist here.

1374
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:22.010
It ain't nobody else's business.

1375
01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:24.020
Two:

1376
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:27.580
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1377
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:30.760
And when you gone.

1378
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:32.760
you stay gone.

1379
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:35.770
or you be gone.

1380
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:38.770
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1381
01:48:40.610 --> 01:48:42.540
Deal.

1382
01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:45.710
Get your ass outta here.

1383
01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:14.420
Oh. shit.

1384
01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.850
Fabienne!

1385
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.860
Fabienne!

1386
01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:57.190
Fabienne!
Come on. baby.

1387
01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:00.690
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1388
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:04.190
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now. we'll miss the train.

1389
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:06.190
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1390
01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:10.200
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1391
01:50:13.710 --> 01:50:15.640
Come on. honey!

1392
01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.180
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1393
01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.770
- It's not a motorcycle. baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1394
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:28.610
I'm sorry. baby.
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now. please?

1395
01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.080
Come on. Let's go.
let's go. let's go.

1396
01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:39.090
- You're hurt?
- No. no. I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1397
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.100
Come on. Hop on.
Baby. please. we-

1398
01:50:42.170 --> 01:50:45.100
Honey. we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1399
01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:50.210
- Oh. baby. I'm sorry.
Come here. come here.

1400
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:52.210
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1401
01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.210
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long. I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1402
01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.210
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1403
01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.220
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1404
01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.220
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1405
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:07.220
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1406
01:51:07.290 --> 01:51:10.230
Since I left you.
this has been. without a doubt.

1407
01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:13.520
the single weirdest
fuckin' day of my life-
I'll tell you all about it.

1408
01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.460
Gotta go. Come on.

1409
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:18.300
Butch. whose motorcycle
is this?

1410
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:20.960
- It's a chopper. baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1411
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.970
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1412
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.600
Zed's dead. baby.
Zed's dead.

1413
01:51:41.790 --> 01:51:44.090
Yes. you did. Brett!

1414
01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.690
You tried to fuck him.
and Marsellus Wallace
don't liked to be fucked...

1415
01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:50.200
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1416
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:53.360
- Oh. God. please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible. Brett?

1417
01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.870
- Yes!
- Well. there's this passage
I got memorized.

1418
01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:59.100
Sorta fits the occasion.

1419
01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:02.470
Ezekiel 25:17.

1420
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:06.850
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1421
01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.850
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1422
01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:12.350
and the tyranny of evil men.

1423
01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:17.090
Blessed is he who. in the name
of charity and good will.

1424
01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.190
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness.

1425
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:22.790
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1426
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:25.600
and the finder
of lost children.

1427
01:52:25.670 --> 01:52:29.930
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

1428
01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:32.170
and furious anger...

1429
01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.630
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1430
01:52:36.710 --> 01:52:40.580
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1431
01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:44.040
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1432
01:52:52.130 --> 01:52:54.550
I'm fucked.
Oh. fuck. Oh. fuck.

1433
01:52:54.630 --> 01:52:57.570
- ls he a friend of yours?
- Oh. goddamn. Goddamn.

1434
01:52:57.630 --> 01:53:00.570
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent. Marvin. Marvin. Vincent.

1435
01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.560
- Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1436
01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:06.830
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1437
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:11.060
Die. you motherfuckers! Die!

1438
01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:42.670
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1439
01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:45.600
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1440
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:47.610
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1441
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:51.610
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1442
01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:59.080
We should be fuckin' dead. man.

1443
01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:01.090
I know.
We was lucky.

1444
01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:04.280
No. no. no. no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1445
01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:08.560
- Yeah. maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1446
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:10.560
You know what
divine intervention is?

1447
01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.370
I think so.

1448
01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:21.870
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1449
01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.380
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1450
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:27.410
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1451
01:54:28.650 --> 01:54:30.640
I think it's time for us
to leave. Jules.

1452
01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:33.150
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1453
01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:37.160
- What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.

1454
01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:39.990
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1455
01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:43.500
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1456
01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.000
or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1457
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:48.690
We should be fuckin' dead.
my friend!

1458
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:53.000
What happened here was a miracle. and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1459
01:54:53.070 --> 01:54:57.770
All right. it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1460
01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:08.150
Let's go. nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1461
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:11.830
You ever seen that show Cops?

1462
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:14.830
I was watching it one time.
and there was this cop on.

1463
01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:18.840
and he was talkin' about this
gunfight he had in the hallway
with this guy. right?

1464
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:22.360
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1465
01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:25.380
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1466
01:55:25.450 --> 01:55:28.780
I mean. you know. it's.
it's freaky. but it happens.

1467
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:33.790
You wanna play blind man.
go walk with the shepherd.
but me. my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1468
01:55:33.850 --> 01:55:36.790
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1469
01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.550
From here on in. you can
consider my ass retired.

1470
01:55:39.630 --> 01:55:41.790
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1471
01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:44.910
- I said. don't do that!
- Hey. why are you fuckin'
freakin' out on us?

1472
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.050
Look. I'm tellin' Marsellus today-
I'm through.

1473
01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:51.060
- Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?
- Don't worry. I will.

1474
01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:55.120
- And I bet you $10.000
he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1475
01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:58.290
Marvin. what do you make of all this?

1476
01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:00.800
Man. I don't even
have an opinion.

1477
01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:05.100
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped-

1478
01:56:05.190 --> 01:56:07.170
What the fuck's happenin'?

1479
01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:09.180
- Aw. shit. man!
- Aw. man!

1480
01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:12.180
- Oh. man. I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1481
01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.480
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1482
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:16.490
- Man. I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time. but this-
- Chill out. man!

1483
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:19.490
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1484
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.490
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1485
01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:24.890
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1486
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.400
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1487
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:31.400
- I don't believe it!
- Well. believe it now. motherfucker!

1488
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:34.460
We gotta get this car off
the road. Cops notice shit
like a car drenched in blood.

1489
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:37.440
- Just take it to
a friendly place. that's all!
- This is the Valley. Vincent.

1490
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:39.940
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1491
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:42.950
- Well. Jules. this ain't
my fuckin' town. man!
- Shit!

1492
01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:45.950
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1493
01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:49.550
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here. by Burbank Studios.

1494
01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:52.560
If Jimmie's ass ain't home.
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do.

1495
01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:55.560
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1496
01:56:55.630 --> 01:56:58.560
Jimmie. how you doin'. man?
It's Jules. Just listen up. man.

1497
01:56:58.630 --> 01:57:02.570
Me and my homeboy are in a car. and we
gotta get it off the road. pronto.

1498
01:57:02.630 --> 01:57:04.830
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1499
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.770
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1500
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.470
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1501
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:16.480
- If he does. what do we do?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls.

1502
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:19.480
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch- Jimmie's a friend.

1503
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:22.490
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1504
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:24.490
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1505
01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.490
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1506
01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.720
Put yourself in his position-
It's 8:00 in the morning.
he just woke up.

1507
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:31.730
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1508
01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.730
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1509
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:38.740
If that favor means I gotta
take shit. he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.

1510
01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:43.040
- Fuck. nigger. what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel. man?
- I was dryin' my hands!

1511
01:57:43.110 --> 01:57:46.040
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1512
01:57:46.110 --> 01:57:49.670
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1513
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:51.680
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1514
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:53.680
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did.

1515
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:56.690
and when I finished. the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1516
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:59.690
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1517
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:03.850
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head. man!

1518
01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:07.360
Look. I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin'. all right?

1519
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:11.890
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position. all right?

1520
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:14.670
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1521
01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:17.670
Ask me nice like that.
no problem.

1522
01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:20.680
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1523
01:58:22.410 --> 01:58:25.280
Mmm! Goddamn. Jimmie!

1524
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:27.440
This some serious
gourmet shit.

1525
01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.450
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1526
01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.490
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1527
01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:33.490
Right?

1528
01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:36.490
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1529
01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.620
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off. Julie.

1530
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.710
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1531
01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.290
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1532
01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:47.300
When Bonnie goes shopping.
she buys shit.

1533
01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:50.990
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it. I wanna taste it.

1534
01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:55.000
But you know what's on
my mind right now? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

1535
01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.240
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1536
01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:00.740
- Jimmie. don't even worry-
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1537
01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:02.740
When you came pulling in here.

1538
01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:06.010
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said.
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1539
01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:09.520
- You know I ain't seen no-
- Did you notice the sign on
the front of my house...

1540
01:59:09.590 --> 01:59:11.520
that said.
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1541
01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:14.320
No. I didn't.

1542
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:17.320
- You know why you didn't
see that sign?
- Why?

1543
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:21.920
'Cause it ain't there.
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business. that's why!

1544
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.930
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker-
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1545
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.440
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house.
I'm gonna get divorced?

1546
01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:32.740
No marriage counselor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1547
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:36.170
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1548
01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:41.240
Man. you know. fuck. I wanna help you.
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1549
01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.410
Jimmie. Jimmie.
she ain't gonna leave you.

1550
01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:47.420
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me. Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1551
01:59:47.490 --> 01:59:51.450
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there?

1552
01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:59.260
Now. look. you know. she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1553
01:59:59.330 --> 02:00:02.390
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1554
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:05.530
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1555
02:00:05.610 --> 02:00:09.540
Well. then. do it. and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1556
02:00:09.610 --> 02:00:12.550
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1557
02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:15.580
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1558
02:00:15.650 --> 02:00:18.590
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1559
02:00:18.650 --> 02:00:21.750
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1560
02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:25.320
Do me that favor. all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1561
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:28.330
Well. say she comes home.

1562
02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.830
What do you think she'll do?

1563
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:34.770
Oh. no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1564
02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.030
That ain't no kinda answer.

1565
02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:40.160
I mean. you know. I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1566
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.110
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1567
02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:45.110
this Bonnie situation is.

1568
02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:49.120
She comes home from a hard day's work.
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen...

1569
02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.120
doing a bunch of gangster shit.

1570
02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:54.250
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1571
02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:58.360
Yeah. I grasp that. Jules.

1572
02:00:58.430 --> 02:01:01.020
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1573
02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:04.030
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1574
02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:08.030
All I want to hear from your ass
is. "You ain't got no problem.
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1575
02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:12.270
Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry.
which should be coming directly."

1576
02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:15.500
You ain't got no problem. Jules.

1577
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.700
I'm on the motherfucker.

1578
02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:22.840
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf. who should be coming directly.

1579
02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.350
You sendin' the Wolf?

1580
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:27.610
Oh. you feel better.
motherfucker?

1581
02:01:27.690 --> 02:01:29.950
Shit. yeah. negro!

1582
02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.150
That's all you had to say!

1583
02:01:33.230 --> 02:01:36.410
She the hysterical type?

1584
02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:39.430
When is she due?

1585
02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:41.590
Mm-hmm.

1586
02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:43.590
Give me
the principals' names again.

1587
02:01:43.670 --> 02:01:45.610
Place your bets.

1588
02:01:46.670 --> 02:01:50.330
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards. please.

1589
02:01:50.410 --> 02:01:52.350
Vincent.

1590
02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:59.010
Jimmie.

1591
02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:02.370
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1592
02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:10.880
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1593
02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:30.630
You're... Jimmie. right?
This is your house?

1594
02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:34.330
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1595
02:02:34.410 --> 02:02:37.340
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1596
02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:39.340
Uh. yeah. Please do.

1597
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:43.070
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1598
02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:45.580
Let's get down
to brass tacks. gentlemen.

1599
02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:48.590
If I was informed correctly. the clock
is ticking. Is that right. Jimmie?

1600
02:02:48.650 --> 02:02:50.590
Uh. one hundred percent.

1601
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:54.590
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m.. correct?
- Uh-huh.

1602
02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:59.150
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here.
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1603
02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:03.530
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge.

1604
02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.040
which. if you do what I say.
when I say it. should be plenty.

1605
02:03:07.110 --> 02:03:11.440
Now. you got a corpse
in a car. minus a head.
in a garage. Take me to it.

1606
02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:21.120
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1607
02:03:21.190 --> 02:03:24.620
Do me a favor. will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1608
02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:28.130
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh. yeah. sure.

1609
02:03:29.590 --> 02:03:32.530
Oh. uh. um.
how do you take it?

1610
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.160
Lotsa cream. lotsa sugar.

1611
02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:40.670
About the car. is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1612
02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:44.180
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?

1613
02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:47.680
- Aside from how it looks.
the car's cool.
- Positive?

1614
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:51.180
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1615
02:03:51.250 --> 02:03:55.310
- As far as I know.
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1616
02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:57.410
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1617
02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:06.000
- Here you go. Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you. Jimmie.

1618
02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:12.770
Mmm.

1619
02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.970
Okay. first thing.
You two.

1620
02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.980
Take the body.
stick it in the trunk.

1621
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.770
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1622
02:04:21.850 --> 02:04:25.780
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1623
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:29.280
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1624
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:33.380
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast. fast. fast.

1625
02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:37.390
Go in the back seat. scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1626
02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:40.400
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1627
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:43.390
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1628
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:47.830
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1629
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:51.990
The pools of blood that have collected.
you gotta soak that shit up.

1630
02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.500
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1631
02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:57.500
I need blankets.
I need comforters. quilts. bedspreads.

1632
02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:01.200
The thicker the better.
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1633
02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.580
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1634
02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:08.580
with quilts and blankets.

1635
02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:12.590
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car.
the subterfuge won't last.

1636
02:05:12.650 --> 02:05:15.520
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1637
02:05:15.590 --> 02:05:17.650
Jimmie. lead the way.
Boys. get to work.

1638
02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:19.490
"Please" would be nice.

1639
02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:23.900
- Come again?
- I said. a "please" would be nice.

1640
02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:29.630
Get it straight. buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1641
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.370
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess.

1642
02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:36.880
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1643
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:40.850
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated. lotsa luck. gentlemen.

1644
02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:44.250
No. Mr. Wolf. it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1645
02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:47.250
Mr. Wolf. listen. I don't
mean disrespect. okay? I respect you.

1646
02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:50.120
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1647
02:05:50.190 --> 02:05:53.250
If I'm curt with you.
it's because time is a factor.

1648
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:57.960
I think fast. I talk fast.
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1649
02:05:58.030 --> 02:06:01.470
So pretty please. with sugar on top.
clean the fuckin' car.

1650
02:06:05.970 --> 02:06:09.640
Don't be lookin' at me like that.
all right? I can feel your look.

1651
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:15.040
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1652
02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:19.050
Green.

1653
02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:23.590
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1654
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:28.230
Mmm. about 20 minutes.

1655
02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:31.670
Nobody who'll be missed.

1656
02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:36.670
You're a good man. Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1657
02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:39.710
- How we comin'. Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1658
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:42.940
I got it all here. but. uh.

1659
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:46.450
- Mr. Wolf.
you gotta understand something.
- Winston. Jimmie. Winston.

1660
02:06:46.510 --> 02:06:50.040
Okay. You gotta
understand something. uh. Winston.

1661
02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.050
Uh- Uh. no.
thank you.

1662
02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:55.250
Uh. this is
our best linen here.

1663
02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:58.260
and it's. uh-
it was a wedding present...

1664
02:06:58.330 --> 02:07:00.760
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1665
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:05.270
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help-
- Let me ask you a question.

1666
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:08.270
- If you don't mind.
- No. no. please. Go ahead.

1667
02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.740
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny.
were they millionaires?

1668
02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:17.810
No.

1669
02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:20.310
Well. your Uncle Marsellus is.

1670
02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:23.840
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1671
02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.350
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here.

1672
02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:30.680
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set.

1673
02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:33.880
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1674
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:41.790
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1675
02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:44.860
How about you. Jimmie?

1676
02:07:46.110 --> 02:07:48.040
You an oak man?

1677
02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:51.080
Oak's nice.

1678
02:07:56.910 --> 02:08:00.780
Oh. man. I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1679
02:08:00.850 --> 02:08:03.280
This is some fucked-up.
repugnant shit.

1680
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.780
Jules. did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1681
02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:09.790
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1682
02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:12.790
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1683
02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:15.720
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1684
02:08:15.790 --> 02:08:19.560
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold. Jules.
for the abuse that I will take.

1685
02:08:19.630 --> 02:08:23.230
Right now. I'm a fuckin' race car.
and you got me in the red.

1686
02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:26.740
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1687
02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:28.740
That's all.
I could blow.

1688
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:30.740
- Oh. you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1689
02:08:30.810 --> 02:08:33.740
Well. I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker. motherfucker.

1690
02:08:33.810 --> 02:08:36.750
Every time my fingers touch brain.
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1691
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:38.750
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1692
02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.750
In fact. what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1693
02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:45.050
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1694
02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.560
I'm washin' windows. and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1695
02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:59.270
Fine job. gentlemen.

1696
02:09:00.610 --> 02:09:03.040
You may get out of this yet.

1697
02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:05.540
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1698
02:09:05.610 --> 02:09:09.050
Well. let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1699
02:09:09.110 --> 02:09:12.550
Phase one is complete- Clean the car-
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1700
02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:14.550
Clean you two.

1701
02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.990
Strip.

1702
02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.820
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1703
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:24.990
Quickly. gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1704
02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:28.000
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1705
02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:30.560
Goddamn. this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1706
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.590
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1707
02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:35.020
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1708
02:09:35.090 --> 02:09:38.530
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1709
02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:41.960
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1710
02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:48.740
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1711
02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:53.240
Don't do nothin' stupid.
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1712
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:57.540
Don't worry. we're taking it with us.
Jim. the soap.

1713
02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:00.920
- Vincent.
- Okay. gentlemen.

1714
02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:04.480
You both been to County before.
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1715
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:07.490
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1716
02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:10.790
Better you than me. gentlemen.

1717
02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.800
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1718
02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:16.730
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey. get out of my hair!

1719
02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:19.700
- Come on. Do it. goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh. um-

1720
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:22.700
Towel.

1721
02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:36.370
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1722
02:10:36.450 --> 02:10:39.710
Perfect.

1723
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:43.240
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1724
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:45.260
You guys look like-

1725
02:10:45.330 --> 02:10:47.760
What do they look like.
Jimmie?

1726
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:51.420
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.

1727
02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:54.980
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes. motherfucker.

1728
02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:57.790
Come on. gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1729
02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:59.800
Don't make me beg.

1730
02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:06.300
Okay. gentlemen. let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1731
02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.930
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1732
02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:12.940
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1733
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:14.910
The place is North Hollywood.

1734
02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:18.970
so a few twists and turns aside.
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1735
02:11:19.050 --> 02:11:22.380
Now. I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules. you ride with me.

1736
02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:25.720
Vincent. you follow
in my Acura.

1737
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:29.730
Now. if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws.

1738
02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:32.890
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.

1739
02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:35.900
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1740
02:11:35.970 --> 02:11:38.230
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1741
02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:40.740
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1742
02:11:40.810 --> 02:11:44.240
How about you. Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1743
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:48.410
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1744
02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:51.420
Fair enough. Now. I drive real
fuckin' fast. so keep up.

1745
02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:53.980
If get my car back
any different than I gave it.

1746
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:56.990
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1747
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:02.520
Outta my way. Rex.

1748
02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.530
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1749
02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.370
- All right.
- Boys. this is Raquel.

1750
02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.060
Someday all this will be hers.

1751
02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:16.010
Hi. So. what's
with the outfits?

1752
02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:19.510
- You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

1753
02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:22.010
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1754
02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:24.850
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1755
02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:26.280
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1756
02:12:26.350 --> 02:12:29.790
It's-
It's your future. I-

1757
02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.620
I see a-
a cab ride.

1758
02:12:32.690 --> 02:12:35.660
Move outta the sticks. fellas.
Say good night. Raquel.

1759
02:12:35.730 --> 02:12:38.660
- Good night. Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1760
02:12:38.730 --> 02:12:41.170
Stay outta trouble.
you crazy kids.

1761
02:12:41.230 --> 02:12:45.170
Mr. Wolf. I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1762
02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:48.170
Yeah. really.
And thank you very much. Mr. Wolf.

1763
02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:50.170
Call me Winston.

1764
02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.680
You see that. young lady? Respect.

1765
02:12:54.750 --> 02:12:58.950
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.

1766
02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:03.050
- Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.

1767
02:13:09.630 --> 02:13:12.560
Wanna share a cab?

1768
02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:16.900
- I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1769
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:19.770
Cool.

1770
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:26.900
I don't know why. I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1771
02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:30.410
- Yeah. he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1772
02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:32.920
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1773
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:35.420
Totally fuckin' cool.
in control.

1774
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:39.540
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1775
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:42.210
Want some bacon?

1776
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:44.230
No. man. I don't eat pork.

1777
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:47.720
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine. that's all.

1778
02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:50.730
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1779
02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.730
I don't eat filthy animals.

1780
02:13:52.810 --> 02:13:56.230
Yeah. but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1781
02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:59.230
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.
but I'd never know...

1782
02:13:59.310 --> 02:14:02.240
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1783
02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:05.240
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1784
02:14:05.310 --> 02:14:09.240
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1785
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:13.650
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1786
02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:17.050
Yeah. but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1787
02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:20.050
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy.

1788
02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.060
but they're definitely dirty.

1789
02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:26.250
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah. so. by that rationale.

1790
02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:29.890
if a pig had a better personality.
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1791
02:14:29.970 --> 02:14:33.900
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1792
02:14:33.970 --> 02:14:38.000
I mean. he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.

1793
02:14:43.610 --> 02:14:45.740
Oh. man. that's good.

1794
02:14:45.810 --> 02:14:49.410
That's good. man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1795
02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:52.480
You've been sittin' there.
all serious and shit.

1796
02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:54.990
- I just been sittin' here. thinkin'.
- About what?

1797
02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:57.990
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1798
02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:01.330
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle. Vincent?

1799
02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:06.430
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1800
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:13.740
When. um. God makes
the impossible possible.

1801
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.710
But this morning...

1802
02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:19.510
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey. Vincent.

1803
02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:23.280
See. that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1804
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:28.290
It could be God stopped the bullets.
changed Coke to Pepsi.
found my car keys.

1805
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:31.350
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1806
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:33.860
Now. whether or not
what we experienced...

1807
02:15:33.930 --> 02:15:37.090
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1808
02:15:37.170 --> 02:15:40.930
But what is significant is.
I felt the touch of God.

1809
02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.940
God got involved.

1810
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:44.730
But why?

1811
02:15:44.810 --> 02:15:47.830
Well. that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1812
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:50.880
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1813
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:52.880
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1814
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:55.610
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1815
02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:59.050
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1816
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.590
Well. that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1817
02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:08.260
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1818
02:16:08.330 --> 02:16:11.420
Then. basically. I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1819
02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:14.940
- What you mean. "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1820
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.970
Walk from place to place.
meet people. get in adventures.

1821
02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.300
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1822
02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:23.670
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1823
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:28.680
- If it takes forever.
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1824
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:32.400
I'll just be Jules. Vincent.
No more. no less.

1825
02:16:32.490 --> 02:16:34.460
No. Jules.
you decided to be a bum.

1826
02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:37.810
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change.

1827
02:16:37.890 --> 02:16:40.820
who sleep in garbage bins.
eat what I throw away.

1828
02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.870
They got a name for that. Jules.
It's called a bum.

1829
02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:47.590
And without a job.
a residence or legal tender.
that's what you're gonna be. man.

1830
02:16:47.670 --> 02:16:49.590
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.

1831
02:16:49.670 --> 02:16:52.600
Look. my friend.
this is just where you and I differ.

1832
02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:55.500
Garçon! Coffee!

1833
02:16:55.570 --> 02:17:00.060
Jules. look. what happened this morning.
man. I agree it was peculiar.

1834
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:03.270
- But water into wine. I-
- All shapes and sizes. Vincent.

1835
02:17:03.350 --> 02:17:06.440
- Don't fuckin' talk
to me that way. man.
- If my answers frighten you.

1836
02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:09.110
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1837
02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:13.920
I'm gonna take a shit.

1838
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:20.540
Let me ask you something.

1839
02:17:20.670 --> 02:17:22.800
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin?

1840
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:26.810
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin. drinkin' my coffee.

1841
02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:28.810
replayin' the incident
in my head.

1842
02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:32.680
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1843
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:35.880
Fuck. To be continued.

1844
02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:50.830
- I love you. Pumpkin.
- I love you. Honey Bunny.

1845
02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:55.370
- Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

1846
02:17:55.440 --> 02:18:00.430
Any one of you fucking pricks move.
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1847
02:18:00.510 --> 02:18:03.910
- You got that?
You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!

1848
02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:07.040
Get on the fuckin'-
Get the fuck down!

1849
02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:11.850
You're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth.
on the count of ten!

1850
02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:16.490
- Mexicans. out of
the fucking kitchen!
- 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8-

1851
02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:19.660
What the fuck are you doing.

1852
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:22.200
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1853
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:24.760
Fucking move! Move!

1854
02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:27.100
Move! Get the fuck-

1855
02:18:27.170 --> 02:18:30.200
Get down on the fucking floor!

1856
02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:32.210
Grandpa! Down!

1857
02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.640
I'm the manager here. and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1858
02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:38.650
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No. sir. I'm not.

1859
02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:42.740
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1860
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:47.520
- I think we got
a hero here. Honey Bunny.
- Well. just execute him!

1861
02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:49.530
I am not a hero.

1862
02:18:49.590 --> 02:18:52.620
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1863
02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:54.460
The restaurant's ours!

1864
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:57.470
Just take whatever you want.

1865
02:18:57.540 --> 02:18:59.470
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1866
02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:02.670
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1867
02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.710
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1868
02:19:07.010 --> 02:19:08.810
Listen. everybody.

1869
02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:10.910
Be calm. cooperate.

1870
02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:13.920
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1871
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:15.950
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1872
02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:31.730
All right. now. people. gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1873
02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.250
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1874
02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:37.560
I said. are we fucking clear?

1875
02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:40.570
Good!
Now. wallets out!

1876
02:19:40.650 --> 02:19:44.230
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1877
02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:47.240
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't
have nothin' on me. man.

1878
02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:49.170
In the bag.

1879
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:52.180
What am I waiting for?
ln the fucking bag.

1880
02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:55.180
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1881
02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:57.480
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1882
02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.490
In the fucking bag.

1883
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:04.510
Tidy up. tidy up. that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1884
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:07.030
In the bag.
In the bag.

1885
02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.140
In the bag.

1886
02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:39.190
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1887
02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:41.790
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1888
02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:44.560
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny. I was thinkin' the same thing.

1889
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:47.570
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1890
02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:51.970
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes. you did.

1891
02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:55.370
What's going on?

1892
02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:58.900
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1893
02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:02.710
I hate to shatter your ego.
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

1894
02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:06.190
- If you don't take your hand off
that case. it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!

1895
02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:09.050
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1896
02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:13.360
Shut the fuck up. fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1897
02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:15.660
Be cool. Honey Bunny. be cool.

1898
02:21:15.730 --> 02:21:17.820
No problem.
I got it under control.

1899
02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.390
Now. I'm gonna count to three.

1900
02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.940
If you don't open that case.
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1901
02:21:31.350 --> 02:21:33.280
We clear?

1902
02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:38.350
One.

1903
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:42.710
Two.

1904
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:44.850
- Three.
- Okay. Ringo.

1905
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:46.990
You win.

1906
02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:49.000
It's yours.

1907
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:55.760
Open it.

1908
02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.870
Hey. what is it?

1909
02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:04.280
What is it?

1910
02:22:04.350 --> 02:22:06.940
Is that what I think it is?

1911
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:09.710
Mm-hmm.

1912
02:22:11.290 --> 02:22:13.410
It's beautiful.

1913
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:16.050
Goddamn it. what is it?

1914
02:22:17.530 --> 02:22:20.460
You let him go!
You let him go!

1915
02:22:20.530 --> 02:22:23.500
- Let go of him. or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1916
02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:26.500
- Say. "Bitch. be cool!"
Say. "Bitch. be cool!"
- Be cool! Be cool!

1917
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:29.300
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1918
02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:32.270
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out. Honey Bunny!

1919
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.140
- Let go of him!
- Chill out. Honey Bunny!

1920
02:22:34.210 --> 02:22:37.130
- Now. promise her
it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1921
02:22:37.210 --> 02:22:39.110
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out. Honey Bunny!

1922
02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:41.110
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1923
02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:44.610
All right. now. Yolanda. we're not
gonna do anything stupid. are we?

1924
02:22:44.690 --> 02:22:47.610
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1925
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:51.170
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1926
02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:54.910
- Come on. Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1927
02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.920
- What?
- Cool.

1928
02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.820
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1929
02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:01.830
We're gonna be cool.

1930
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:06.800
Now. Ringo.
I'm gonna count to three.

1931
02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:08.960
And when I count three.

1932
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:11.970
I want you to
let go of your gun.

1933
02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:15.490
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1934
02:23:16.570 --> 02:23:18.630
And when you do it.

1935
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:20.770
you do it cool.

1936
02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:23.180
You ready?

1937
02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:25.340
One.

1938
02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:27.610
two.

1939
02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:29.620
three.

1940
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:39.720
- Okay. now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1941
02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:43.390
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now. when you yell
at me. it makes me nervous.

1942
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:45.560
When I get nervous.
I get scared.

1943
02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:49.470
When motherfuckers get scared.
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

1944
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:54.740
Just know. you hurt him. you die.

1945
02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:58.210
Well. that seems to be
the situation.

1946
02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:00.220
But I don't want that.

1947
02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.220
And you don't want that.

1948
02:24:02.290 --> 02:24:05.020
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1949
02:24:05.090 --> 02:24:07.180
So let's see what we can do.

1950
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:12.830
Now... here's the situation.

1951
02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:16.770
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken.

1952
02:24:16.830 --> 02:24:20.270
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period.

1953
02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:23.270
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1954
02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:27.280
But I can't give you this case.
'cause it don't belong to me.

1955
02:24:27.350 --> 02:24:30.280
Besides. I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1956
02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:33.280
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1957
02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:35.220
Vincent!

1958
02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:38.220
- Be cool! Yolanda. it's cool. baby.
- Get back!

1959
02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:40.990
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1960
02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:45.220
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

1961
02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:47.360
Now. Vincent. you just hang back...

1962
02:24:47.430 --> 02:24:49.370
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

1963
02:24:49.430 --> 02:24:51.370
Tell her it's still cool.

1964
02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:54.370
- It's still cool. Honey Bunny.
- How we doin'. baby?

1965
02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:58.440
I- I gotta go pee.

1966
02:24:58.510 --> 02:25:00.440
I wanna go home.

1967
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:04.110
Hang in there. baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1968
02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:07.120
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1969
02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:10.550
- I'm proud of you. Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1970
02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:13.780
- I love you too. Honey Bunny.
- Now.

1971
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:17.790
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1972
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:24.260
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

1973
02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:41.080
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1974
02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:44.250
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1975
02:25:49.310 --> 02:25:51.460
Count it.

1976
02:25:57.780 --> 02:26:00.300
How much is there?

1977
02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:04.140
About 1.500 dollars.

1978
02:26:04.210 --> 02:26:07.410
Okay. put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1979
02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:10.680
Now. with the rest
of those wallets and the register.

1980
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:12.840
that makes this a pretty successful
little score. huh?

1981
02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:16.820
Jules. you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1.500 dollars. and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

1982
02:26:16.890 --> 02:26:20.330
No. Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn. motherfuckin' thing!

1983
02:26:20.390 --> 02:26:22.490
Vince. shut the fuck up!

1984
02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:26.430
- Shut up!
- Come on. Yolanda. Stay with me. baby.

1985
02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:29.430
Now. I ain't givin' it
to him. Vincent.

1986
02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.440
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1987
02:26:32.670 --> 02:26:35.870
- Wanna know what I'm buyin'. Ringo?
- What?

1988
02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:40.680
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1989
02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:43.440
You read the Bible. Ringo?

1990
02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:46.450
Not regularly. no.

1991
02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:48.950
Well. there's this passage
I got memorized.

1992
02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:52.550
Ezekiel 25:17.

1993
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:55.460
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1994
02:26:55.530 --> 02:26:57.460
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1995
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:59.460
and the tyranny of evil men.

1996
02:26:59.530 --> 02:27:02.900
Blessed is he who.
in the name of charity and good will.

1997
02:27:02.970 --> 02:27:05.400
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness.

1998
02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:09.570
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

1999
02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:13.940
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2000
02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:17.070
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2001
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:20.180
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2002
02:27:20.250 --> 02:27:23.810
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2003
02:27:24.890 --> 02:27:27.330
I been sayin' that shit for years.

2004
02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:30.560
and if you heard it.
that meant your ass.

2005
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:33.570
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2006
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:36.570
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2007
02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:39.070
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2008
02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:42.570
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2009
02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:45.580
See. now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2010
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:50.510
you're the evil man.
and I'm the righteous man.

2011
02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:53.520
and Mr. 9-millimeter here.
he's the shepherd...

2012
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:57.150
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2013
02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:59.160
Or it could mean...

2014
02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:02.660
you're the righteous man.
and I'm the shepherd.

2015
02:28:02.730 --> 02:28:06.670
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2016
02:28:06.730 --> 02:28:09.000
Now. I'd like that.

2017
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:11.970
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2018
02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:13.900
The truth is.

2019
02:28:14.970 --> 02:28:16.910
you're the weak...

2020
02:28:18.310 --> 02:28:21.710
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2021
02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:25.050
But I'm tryin'. Ringo.

2022
02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.250
I'm tryin' real hard...

2023
02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:31.590
to be the shepherd.

2024
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:48.830
Go.

2025
02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:08.950
I think we should be
leaving now.

2026
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:11.950
Yeah. that's probably a good idea.
