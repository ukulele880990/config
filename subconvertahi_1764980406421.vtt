2
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.873
It's...

3
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:24.710
Uh... Yeah. This way.

4
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.464
Okay. Okay.

5
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.053
Here we are inside. uh.
something called Agri-Jet.

6
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:39.517
It's a refrigerated warehouse in. uh.
Albuquerque. New Mexico.

7
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.767
Jesus.

8
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.146
It's cold in here. Uh...

9
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.566
All right. let me show you around.
I'll give you a sense of the place.

10
00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.276
give you the grand tour.

11
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.028
It's-It's. uh... It's huge.

12
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.946
It's maybe hundred feet long.

13
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.866
I don't know what that is in meters.
but it's massive.

14
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.452
And it is packed to the rafters

15
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:03.248
with lots and lots of...

16
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:05.792
shrink-wrapped...

17
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.252
items.

18
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.341
Yeah. so what's inside?

19
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.301
Well...

20
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.304
A picture's worth a thousand words. right?

21
00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.681
So. I'm gonna let you see for yourself.

22
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.395
Okay.

23
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.067
Okay.

24
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.236
Do you see this?

25
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.196
Huh? Yeah.

26
00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:36.824
It's...

27
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.993
That is not a Butterball turkey.

28
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.494
I'll tell you that much.

29
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.038
What are they doing with all this. huh?

30
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.373
Guess.

31
00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.041
Fucking guess.

32
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:50.880
Because this whole place is filled

33
00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:52.464
with human bodies.

34
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.467
It's parts of them!

35
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.635
It's pieces of them.

36
00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.638
All vacuum sealed.

37
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:04.476
That is what this whole plant
is being used for.

38
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.355
And it's been happening
right under our noses.

39
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.233
I mean. they got out
of this town in a hurry.

40
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.069
but I guarantee you. before that.

41
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.224
they were probably doing
three shifts a day in here.

42
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.076
And what's behind that door. huh?

43
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:27.416
It is a meat grinder
the size of a bus and vats.

44
00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.251
cooking vats.

45
00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.503
And wait until you see
what's inside those.

46
00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:02.357
Two million. four hundred thousand even.

47
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.274
All in.

48
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.448
All in.

49
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.168
Five million dollars.

50
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.336
The house record.

51
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.561
Are you sure?

52
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.453
Please reveal your cards.

53
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.629
A straight flush.

54
00:09:49.548 --> 00:09:51.550
Mmm.

55
00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:14.531
-A royal flush.
-Ooh! Ooh.

56
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.367
The higher hand.

57
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.175
Hey. pal. Stay in character.

58
00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:42.059
You may have won this time. Mr. Diabaté.

59
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.937
But your luck is about to run out.

60
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.565
Someday. perhaps...

61
00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:54.655
...but not today.

62
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.074
For you. my lovely.

63
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.078
It's been an honor.

64
00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:07.459
Oh.

65
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:11.172
Anyone else?

66
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.637
Come. my beauties.

67
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:28.397
Next time.

68
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.902
It's been a pleasure!

69
00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:36.298
Mmm.

70
00:12:41.345 --> 00:12:42.513
Mmm.

71
00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:45.349
And you are?

72
00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.227
-Joette.
-Joette!

73
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.980
Come in. my dear.

74
00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.205
We're terribly sorry. our love.

75
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.124
but we have to leave immediately.

76
00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:13.627
What? Why?

77
00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:16.046
You're going to have a visitor.

78
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:24.721
You can come with us. if you want.

79
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.185
I can't do that to her.

80
00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:31.729
Sooner or later. we'll have to talk.

81
00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.526
Is there no time for even a little...?

82
00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.613
Joette?

83
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.594
Please be here.
Please be here. Please be here.

84
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.596
Please be here. Please be here.

85
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:32.016
<i>Penthouse.</i>

86
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.457
Hello?

87
00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:17.603
In here.

88
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.200
Just in time. Carol.

89
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:36.539
So. on their way out the door.
they told you I was coming?

90
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:37.789
Mm-hmm.

91
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.792
-Why'd you stay?
-To welcome you.

92
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:43.337
No. thanks.

93
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.756
I appreciate that.

94
00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:49.272
I bet they didn't tell you
why I was coming.

95
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.553
There's no way in hell they did.

96
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.432
You're gonna need something
stronger than champagne

97
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:55.974
when you see what I brought.

98
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.685
Do you. uh...

99
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.523
...have a TV in this barn?

100
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.740
Impressive.

101
00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:23.585
Okay.

102
00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.256
What do you got? H...
Uh... HDMI. All right.

103
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.675
Is this another one of your videos?

104
00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:30.843
You've seen my videos?

105
00:17:30.926 --> 00:17:32.010
Mm-hmm.

106
00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.014
They actually sent you my videos?

107
00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:36.098
Of course.

108
00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:37.516
They were very well done.

109
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.476
Very dramatic.

110
00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:42.813
Well. you could have...

111
00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.192
Forget it.

112
00:17:46.275 --> 00:17:49.027
When you see this one...

113
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:52.198
Let's just say...

114
00:17:52.281 --> 00:17:53.615
It's disturbing.

115
00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.494
And. uh. I hate to use a cliché.

116
00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.996
but you might want to sit down. Seriously.

117
00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:01.707
'Cause I am telling you
what you are about to witness...

118
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.584
Is this about them eating people?

119
00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:08.255
-What?
-It is troubling.

120
00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.800
Wait. how would you... How could you...

121
00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:13.802
Allow me.

122
00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.600
<i>Hello. Carol. We're John Cena.</i>

123
00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.353
<i>and we're here to address some questions
you may be having</i>

124
00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:23.854
<i>regarding our food supply.</i>

125
00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.608
<i>As you know.
we can't purposely kill. harm.</i>

126
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.277
<i>or otherwise interfere
with any form of life.</i>

127
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.155
<i>That limits what we're able to consume.</i>

128
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.951
<i>Because when we say "any life."
that includes plant life.</i>

129
00:18:37.034 --> 00:18:39.787
<i>We can't harvest wheat or corn or rice.</i>

130
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.788
<i>We can't pluck an apple from a tree.</i>

131
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.041
<i>Once an apple drops of its own accord.</i>

132
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.418
<i>well. we'll eat it. of course.
and gratefully.</i>

133
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:49.547
<i>Indeed. we harvest
all the windfall we can find.</i>

134
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.971
<i>Plus. there are billions
of domesticated animals.</i>

135
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:55.761
<i>cows. chief amongst them.
that still require milking.</i>

136
00:18:56.345 --> 00:18:59.598
<i>And there's preexisting food.
millions of tons of it.</i>

137
00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.767
<i>that was processed prior to our joining.</i>

138
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:03.936
<i>So far. so good. right?</i>

139
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:06.647
<i>Except for one small problem.</i>

140
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:14.154
<i>As of this taping.
there are 7.348.292.411 of us.</i>

141
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.657
<i>That's a lot of mouths to feed.</i>

142
00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:18.951
<i>We're facing a caloric deficit.</i>

143
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.231
<i>and to make up for it.
we've had to take certain measures.</i>

144
00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:26.041
<i>This is how we get our sustenance.</i>

145
00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:30.003
<i>One half-pint of this shelf-stable liquid
contains 300 calories.</i>

146
00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:33.924
<i>Which means that based on
a diet of 2.400 calories a day.</i>

147
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:38.345
<i>someone John Cena's size
needs eight of these every 24 hours.</i>

148
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:42.015
<i>Larger individuals require more.
Smaller ones. less.</i>

149
00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:43.893
<i>What's in it?</i>

150
00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:45.478
<i>Well. a lot of things.</i>

151
00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:47.354
<i>It's manufactured across the globe.</i>

152
00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:51.191
<i>so the recipe changes based on
the local availability of ingredients.</i>

153
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.862
<i>Mostly. it's those stockpiled
foodstuffs we spoke of.</i>

154
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:57.447
<i>particularly ones that
are in danger of spoiling.</i>

155
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.243
<i>Additionally. each carton
contains eight to 12%</i>

156
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.161
<i>of something we call HDP.</i>

157
00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.122
<i>Human-derived protein.</i>

158
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.583
<i>And yep.
that's pretty much what it sounds like.</i>

159
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:13.255
<i>Nearly 100.000 people pass away each day
due to natural causes and accidents.</i>

160
00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.925
<i>Those human remains.
which would otherwise go to waste.</i>

161
00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:17.843
<i>are our source of HDP.</i>

162
00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.431
<i>We cherish the memory of these people
and appreciate their sacrifice.</i>

163
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:26.101
<i>Given our druthers.
would we choose to consume HDP?</i>

164
00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:27.937
<i>No.</i>

165
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.648
<i>Throughout history. most cultures.
though not all.</i>

166
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:32.900
<i>have taken a dim view of anthropophagy.</i>

167
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.445
<i>Honestly. we're not
that keen on it ourselves.</i>

168
00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.864
<i>But we're left with little choice.</i>

169
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.618
<i>Rest assured. Carol. you will
never have to consume this product.</i>

170
00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:46.038
<i>Not unless you want to.
which we assume is unlikely.</i>

171
00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:50.126
<i>We will never serve HDP to you
in any form at any time.</i>

172
00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:52.378
<i>We will continue
to reserve only the freshest.</i>

173
00:20:52.461 --> 00:20:55.130
<i>best windfall
and stockpiled foods for you.</i>

174
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.758
<i>We hope that clears things up.</i>

175
00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:01.720
{\an8}<i>As always. your well-being is
of the utmost importance to us.</i>

176
00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:06.350
{\an8}<i>Any comments. concerns. call any
time. day or night. and leave a voicemail.</i>

177
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.603
<i>We regret not being able
to speak to you directly.</i>

178
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:12.189
<i>but for the time being. we need our space.</i>

179
00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.031
So you knew all about this?

180
00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:24.034
How... When...

181
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.161
For how long?

182
00:21:25.244 --> 00:21:28.956
About a week ago. out of curiosity.
I asked John Cena.

183
00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:31.667
"Why do you people drink so much milk?"

184
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:33.819
We had been hanging out together.

185
00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.755
He was teaching me
the sunset flip power bomb.

186
00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:39.300
And what was your reaction?

187
00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:40.634
Do-do you even have one?

188
00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.469
As I said. it is troubling.

189
00:21:43.637 --> 00:21:44.888
Very much so.

190
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:48.273
It probably helps that
I've had time to think about it.

191
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.854
I must say John Cena makes
a fairly reasonable case.

192
00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:53.647
In French. he's even more convincing.

193
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.817
That is not John Cena.

194
00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:00.404
Jesus Christ. why are you so...

195
00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:06.076
How about the fact that in Spain
they all said they were vegetarians?

196
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.245
Ah. yes. I asked John about that.

197
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.664
He reminded me that
technically what they said was

198
00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:13.334
that they would prefer to be vegetarian.

199
00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:16.545
Oh. great. so all the fucking
lawyers in the world survived.

200
00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.005
Carol. for the record.

201
00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:22.093
I am in no way pleased with the idea
of these people eating human flesh.

202
00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:23.719
None of us are.

203
00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:24.887
Us?

204
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:27.723
Who's us?

205
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:33.521
The other individuals.

206
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.899
The ones like you and me.

207
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.443
We stay in touch.

208
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.114
You stay in touch?

209
00:22:43.197 --> 00:22:45.032
-Mm-hmm.
-All 12 of you?

210
00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:47.451
Uh. all but one.
There's a gentleman in Paraguay.

211
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:50.621
Uh. chaperones reach out.
but he doesn't reply.

212
00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:54.458
But the other 11 of us. yes.

213
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.293
So the 11 of you. you...

214
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:00.047
What? You just hang out?

215
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.426
Potluck suppers and whatnot.

216
00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:05.136
-We meet occasionally.
-Okay.

217
00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:07.012
Tuesdays and Fridays.

218
00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:08.556
Oh. well. that's a lot of flying.

219
00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:10.057
Mostly. we're on Zoom.

220
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.225
Oh.

221
00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:13.852
Right.

222
00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:16.219
What do you guys talk about?

223
00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:19.984
I mean. it can't be saving the world
'cause you shot that down really quickly.

224
00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:21.944
In a sense it is.

225
00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:27.783
Carol. what John Cena did not mention
is that even with the HDP.

226
00:23:28.784 --> 00:23:32.705
most of the world's population will
starve to death within the next ten years.

227
00:23:32.788 --> 00:23:34.623
-Says who?
-Says them.

228
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.376
If you press them long enough.

229
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:40.587
We wish to save them from that.

230
00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:44.572
At our most recent gathering.
we pitched the idea of robotic farming.

231
00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:48.262
However. as it is. they would have
to build and program the robots.

232
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:49.930
-Ah.
-Hmm.

233
00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:51.515
They did appreciate the input.

234
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:53.100
-I bet.
-Mmm.

235
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:58.313
Did you guys ever talk about
including me in the Zooms?

236
00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:00.607
I mean...

237
00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:04.653
I am a professional writer.
and no offense.

238
00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:07.656
but I can come up with shit
like robots all day long.

239
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.491
We. uh...

240
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:11.618
We took a vote.

241
00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:13.621
It was not unanimous.

242
00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:17.541
but the majority felt
your presence might prove. uh...

243
00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.169
disruptive.

244
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:23.005
Oh.

245
00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:25.591
Also. our non-English speakers
were perhaps a bit offended that

246
00:24:25.674 --> 00:24:28.218
you did not invite them
to join us in Spain.

247
00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.847
I'm sorry. Carol.

248
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.433
Mmm. Ultimately this is not about you.

249
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.436
Or any of us. for that matter.

250
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.937
Yeah. sure. I get it.

251
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:43.942
Where's your nearest bathroom?

252
00:25:22.064 --> 00:25:25.234
But she's so lonely.

253
00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:29.112
Yes. I know.

254
00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:31.782
Okay.

255
00:25:36.578 --> 00:25:39.164
I miss you too. my loves.

256
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.543
See you soon.

257
00:27:15.052 --> 00:27:17.137
Ah! You're awake.

258
00:27:17.763 --> 00:27:20.933
Once again.
your timing is perfect.

259
00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:22.893
Please. sit.

260
00:27:38.951 --> 00:27:41.049
That looks good. Thanks.

261
00:27:47.668 --> 00:27:49.086
Mmm.

262
00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:43.640
Hmm.

263
00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:46.185
Hmm.

264
00:28:49.354 --> 00:28:50.355
So...

265
00:28:51.315 --> 00:28:52.691
what are your plans?

266
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:56.529
Well. I'm sure you need a break from me.

267
00:28:59.698 --> 00:29:01.700
I have enjoyed your company. Carol.

268
00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:03.536
-You like your space. I get it.
-No.

269
00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:07.790
So. I was thinking
I'll go find my own suite.

270
00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:09.791
get cleaned up. and then. uh.

271
00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:12.169
we can get together later.

272
00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:13.962
Talk some more.

273
00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:28.018
I'm just messing with you.

274
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:35.234
Well done.

275
00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:38.195
Truth is.
I can't get out of Vegas fast enough.

276
00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:42.699
This city is like
a trillion dollar light-up ashtray.

277
00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.245
No offense to your new town.

278
00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:48.163
No. none taken.

279
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.582
I'm sure it's no Albuquerque.

280
00:29:54.336 --> 00:29:56.255
Carol. you can always call me.

281
00:29:56.338 --> 00:29:59.007
Dial zero.
and they will find me wherever I am.

282
00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:00.926
Thanks.

283
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:02.719
How you say. uh.

284
00:30:03.303 --> 00:30:05.055
"check in" now and then. hmm?

285
00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:06.390
Sure.

286
00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:11.668
Maybe you will have some ideas on how
to save these people from starvation.

287
00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:14.546
I don't know.

288
00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:17.484
Maybe tell 'em to pick a fucking apple.

289
00:30:18.402 --> 00:30:20.153
-Wow.
-Sorry.

290
00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:21.864
I didn't mean that.

291
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:24.700
I mean. fuck it. yes. I did.

292
00:30:25.284 --> 00:30:26.535
I meant that. but...

293
00:30:27.744 --> 00:30:28.912
not like it sounded.

294
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.624
I'm not some kind of monster. you know?

295
00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:34.251
I just. um...

296
00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:36.253
They're doing this to themselves.

297
00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:38.339
They are choosing to starve.

298
00:30:38.422 --> 00:30:40.674
-They do not see it that way.
-Listen to me.

299
00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:45.012
The only way to save these lunatics
is to turn them back the way they were.

300
00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:48.307
There is a way to reverse this.

301
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.975
Help me find it.

302
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:53.521
Do you seriously think
the world is a better place now.

303
00:30:53.604 --> 00:30:55.105
just because it's peaceful?

304
00:30:57.232 --> 00:31:00.986
Well. once they turn us.
we're gonna starve right along with them.

305
00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:02.738
Have you thought of that?

306
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:05.616
They cannot turn us.

307
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:08.493
not without our consent.

308
00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:13.749
What do you mean?

309
00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:16.460
It seems the only way
to make their virus work on us

310
00:31:16.543 --> 00:31:19.797
is by tailoring it
to our individual stem cells.

311
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.551
But to obtain those stem cells. they
must first collect them from our bodies.

312
00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:25.803
Um. what... What?

313
00:31:25.886 --> 00:31:29.973
Apparently that involves sticking
a large needle into the bone of the hip.

314
00:31:30.807 --> 00:31:32.226
Somewhat painful.

315
00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:33.685
And very invasive.

316
00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:38.440
Something they cannot do
without our permission.

317
00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.402
When did you find this out?

318
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.072
They made this discovery only yesterday.

319
00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:48.485
They are not pleased about it.
I can assure you.

320
00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:52.120
They asked me if I would give my consent.

321
00:31:53.163 --> 00:31:54.331
I said. uh.

322
00:31:55.123 --> 00:31:58.877
"Regrettably. as of this time.
I prefer not to."

323
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:13.517
<i>Hello. Carol.</i>

324
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.935
<i>This is a recording.</i>

325
00:32:15.644 --> 00:32:19.815
<i>At the tone. you can leave a message

00:32:19.898 --> 00:32:21.650

327
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.987
<i>Our feelings for you
haven't changed. Carol.</i>

328
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:29.408
<i>But after everything that's happened.
we just need a little space.</i>

329
00:32:32.369 --> 00:32:33.453
It's me.

330
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:38.834
Is it true that you need
our stem cells to turn us into you?

331
00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:42.254
And furthermore. is it true that
you need our express permission

332
00:32:42.337 --> 00:32:44.923
to collect those stem cells?

333
00:32:57.436 --> 00:32:58.520
Carol.

334
00:33:25.672 --> 00:33:27.174
<i>Hello. Carol.</i>

335
00:33:27.257 --> 00:33:28.509
<i>This is a recording.</i>

336

339
00:33:38.894 --> 00:33:42.690
<i>But after everything that's happened.

340
00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:50.448
I am officially going on record
that I do not consent.

341
00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:52.783
You will not lay a finger on me.

342
00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:55.369
Repeat that back.

343
00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:38.245
Uh. this is your vehicle?

344
00:34:38.328 --> 00:34:39.413
Yep.

345
00:34:42.748 --> 00:34:44.168
Interesting choice.

346
00:34:47.462 --> 00:34:48.463
You too.

347
00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:11.236
For what it's worth.
the world is doing the best it can.

348
00:35:11.987 --> 00:35:13.071
It misses you.

349
00:35:13.697 --> 00:35:15.199
Zosia misses you.

350
00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:17.245
They want to come back. Carol.

351
00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:20.913
They're just looking
for a change of heart.

352
00:35:22.372 --> 00:35:23.373
Fuck 'em.

353
00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:26.710
Watch your toes.

354
00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:00.401
<i>To my 12 fellow survivors...</i>

355
00:40:00.484 --> 00:40:01.485
Twelve?

356
00:40:01.568 --> 00:40:03.714
<i>...greetings.
I'm Carol Sturka.</i>

357
00:40:04.446 --> 00:40:05.656
<i>Some of you know me.</i>

358
00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:07.324
<i>Some of you I've yet to meet.</i>

359
00:40:07.824 --> 00:40:11.245
<i>But... if you're still one of us.</i>

360
00:40:12.454 --> 00:40:13.956
<i>then this message is for you.</i>

361
00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:19.461
<i>There is a way to undo this situation.</i>

362
00:40:20.212 --> 00:40:23.632
<i>To turn the world back
the way it's supposed to be.</i>

363
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.511
<i>How do I know this?</i>

364
00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:33.601
<i>Because earlier today.
these afflicted people. these Others.</i>

365
00:40:33.684 --> 00:40:35.489
<i>they basically told me so themselves.</i>

366
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.396
<i>Because guess what?</i>

367
00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:40.107
<i>They can't lie.</i>

368
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:43.444
<i>Which is yet another thing
I've discovered.</i>

369
00:40:43.527 --> 00:40:47.072
<i>This alien virus or whatever it is.</i>

370
00:40:47.155 --> 00:40:50.576
<i>it doesn't allow them to do that.</i>

371
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.831
<i>So. what is this solution exactly?</i>

372
00:40:56.707 --> 00:40:58.042
<i>That they didn't tell me.</i>

373
00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:01.461
<i>But-But they so resisted telling me.</i>

374
00:41:02.254 --> 00:41:04.798
<i>that everybody suddenly burst into tears.</i>

375
00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:08.177
<i>Worldwide. apparently.</i>

376
00:41:08.802 --> 00:41:10.704
<i>Which I know upset at least one of you.</i>

377
00:41:11.346 --> 00:41:12.848
<i>And then after that.</i>

378
00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:16.435
<i>they completely abandoned
the city I live in.</i>

379
00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:19.771
<i>Leaving me here all alone.</i>

380
00:41:20.355 --> 00:41:22.774
<i>Which says to me I'm on the right track.</i>

381
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:28.197
<i>Now. I realize some of you</i>

382
00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:31.575
<i>think the world
might be better off this way.</i>

383
00:41:32.451 --> 00:41:35.454
<i>with all the newfound peace.
love and understanding.</i>

384
00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:37.915
<i>Enjoy that opinion.</i>

385
00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:40.417
<i>Relish it.</i>

386
00:41:41.084 --> 00:41:43.504
<i>Because it may be
the last one you ever possess.</i>

387
00:41:44.129 --> 00:41:48.384
<i>And when the day comes that you have
peace and love forced upon you.</i>

388
00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:51.220
<i>who knows.
maybe in that last fleeting moment.</i>

389
00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:56.141
<i>you might just realize
you treasure your individuality.</i>

390
00:43:32.112 --> 00:43:35.332
If there is someone here.
I advise you to get out now.

391
00:46:33.168 --> 00:46:34.711
Hello. son.

392
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:44.471
We're happy to see you.

393
00:46:47.683 --> 00:46:50.811
You must be hungry and confused.

394
00:46:54.565 --> 00:46:56.984
Can we answer any questions?

395
00:47:05.993 --> 00:47:09.496
Tell us. What can we do for you. son?

396
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.002
Don't call me son. You're not my mother.

397
00:47:20.048 --> 00:47:22.092
My mother's a bitch.
