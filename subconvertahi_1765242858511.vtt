The easiest way to win a game

2
00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.344
is to make your opponent

3
00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.305
think they're playing
a different game entirely.

4
00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.015
The only crime I'm guilty of
is being an embarrassing nepo baby

5
00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.852
- who's trying to do some good.
- Yeah. how's that going?

6
00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:22.105
I wanna prove to everyone
that I'm not a... fuck-up.

7
00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.608
Jay didn't do it.
He's sweeter than I expected.

8
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.361
That lying piece of shit.
This isn't his finger.

9
00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.862
Enjoy the remodel.

[Charles-Haden Savage]
What's Mayor Tillman doing here?

12
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:33.992
How is the pod? Right?

13
00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.703
I'm... Hey. I'm still avail to guest. FYI.

14
00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:38.956
I'm collecting signatures
to stop New York City

15
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.958
from opening its first ever casino.

16
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.584
I got an offer on my place.

17
00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:43.919
It's big.

18
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.005
I. uh. joined a dating service
for sexy seniors.

19
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.507
It's called. uh. Last Gasp.

20
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.426
Oh! Last Gasp notification.

21
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.054
- Priscilla. she's so funny.
- You told her about the case?

22
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.973
Just a... a little tidbit.

23
00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.349
You're being catfished. Charles.

24
00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.352
This glitch is from the same footage
as THĒ and Seth Rogen's.

25
00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.730
- Something has been cut out.
- Why is the Last Gasp peach logo

26
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:06.024
the same as on the security footage?

27
00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.569
That's who's been messaging me?

28
00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:11.572
- And cooked the footage.
- And maybe killed Lester.

29
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.699
- [phone dings]
- What does it say?

You're such a smarty-pants.

When you live as a titan of industry

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.797
on this planet amid the metropoleis...

35
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.803
nothing means more than getting away.

[♪ dramatic orchestra music continues]

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:41.310
To think. to play. or just... escape.

[metal gates squeaking]

39
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.813
You think he knows
he's goin' to the vet?

40
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.899
Well. if he didn't. he does now.

41
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.693
- [phone alarm blaring]
- Oh.

42
00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.488
Ooh. it's one of those "Silver Alerts."
Always so sad

43
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.198
- when an old person goes missing.
- [clicking tongue] Aw.

44
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.911
It says. "Endangered adult male.
74. 5'7". brunette.

45
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.623
"last seen wearing
southwestern cowboy boots

- [Oliver Putnam] Oh! Thank God!

47
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.877
Did it say the boots were turquoise?

48
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.629
- [♪ dramatic music playing]
- Oh. thank God!

49
00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.880
Thank God.

50
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.757
You gotta save me. [panting]

51
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.134
- I'm in danger.
- [thunder rumbling]

52
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.678
[Bash]
You hear it all the time.

53
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:19.473
"The bigger the risk.
the bigger the reward."

54
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.268
But when it comes down to it. most people
aren't willing to take the leap.

55
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:25.562
What the very successful know

56
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:29.358
is that you have to take bold risks
to strike gold.

57
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:34.112
So. tell me. are you willing
to go all in for greatness?

58
00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:36.698
- I said. are you willing?
- Yes!

59
00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.827
[chuckles] Sorry.
I know he is our murder suspect.

60
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.039
But the "Bash Steed Greatness Academy"
audio tapes

61
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.083
are really inspiring.

62
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.959
That was $18 well spent.

63
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:52.464
If only he let it slip where to find him.
then I'd be all in.

64
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.341
Oh. wait a minute.
this might be something.

65
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.425
- What?
- [Charles] Oh. No.

66
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.805
His company website says.
"Bash Steed is a citizen of the universe

67
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.140
"with a home in each of the continents

68
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:05.143
- and a bio module on Mars."
- Wow. Wow.

69
00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:08.063
He's also an asshole. pardon my French.

70
00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.940
I mean. he did pretend
to be my girlfriend.

71
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.609
Mm. not exactly sure you can call
Priscilla a girlfriend

72
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.612
when you messaged for six hours
and you've never met in person.

73
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.781
Oh. how embarrassing.

74
00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.034
Someone doesn't know
the term "situationship."

75
00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:24.287
Okay. will you two Muppets
stop arguing?

76
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.290
We need to prepare
for our interview with the mayor.

77
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.834
Fine. I'm over it anyway.

78
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.419
Although I still don't know
why we're podcasting

79
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.754
if we're not allowed
to talk about our suspects.

80
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:36.049
That's because
we are contractually obligated

81
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.468
to make content for Wondify.

82
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.556
- This is so dumb.
- No. no. no. um. I think interviews

83
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.808
are an evolution of our brand.

84
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.978
And having the mayor
as our first guest is quite the get.

85
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.980
I've already reached out
to Meghan Markle's team

86
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.606
about being guest number two.

87
00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:54.735
- [doorbell rings]
- Okay. that must be him... Oh!

88
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.403
Did you see the email from Wondify?

89
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.613
They want us to be
more like the Drunken Sluts.

90
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.575
You know. so they want us to slut it up!
[exclaiming and gulping]

- How are you. Charles?

96
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.797
- [Charles grunts]
- Oh. my goodness.

97
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.966
- Hello. What a pleasure.
- Hello. how are you?

98
00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.885
- Thank you. Thank you.
- A pleasure. Big fan.

99
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:24.181
Thank you.
Oh. I can't believe I'm here. finally.

100
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.184
Wasn't sure how many overtures
I was gonna have to make

101
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.437
before you would finally take the hint
and let me on the pod.

102
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.688
- [all laughing]
- [Oliver] Oh. no. no.

103
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.939
[Mayor Tillman]
But fear not. fear not.

104
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.234
I have been working
on my podcast voice for months.

105
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:37.569
Check it out. [clearing throat]

106
00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.155

I am Michael Barbaro.

107
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.573
Uh-huh?

108
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.699
[normal voice]
Oh. no. that's it.

109
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:44.034
- Oh!
- Oh.

110
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.245
- [claps] That was so good.
- Oh. well. let's just get this started.

111
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.330
Alright.

112
00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.581
[recorder beeps]

113
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.749

114
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.627
[loudly] Oliver and Mabel.
we got a really special edition

115
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.629
of Only Murders podcast today.

116
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.340
We're sitting with
New York City Mayor Beau Tillman!

117
00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.800
- [laughing and clapping]
- [Tillman chuckles]

118
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:00.967
- [Charles] Whoo!
- Thank you.

119
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.386
Thank you very much. Charles.
Uh. a huge fan.

120
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.763
- Ohh!
- Yeah. [chuckles]

121
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.932
Uh. you know.
a big part of my platform

122
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.559
is making the streets of this city safer.

123
00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.062
so I am excited to chop it up today.
[claps]

124
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.482
Well. uh. great. So the first
and most obvious. uh. question is...

125
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.067
- Mm-hmm?
- ...what are you gonna do about

126
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.528
the crosswalk button on 86th and Broadway?

127
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.197
Oh. uh. is... is it broken?

128
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.324
No. but the button gets a little sticky.

129
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.493
and sometimes it... it's...
it's difficult to tell

130
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.203
if you've pushed it or not.

131
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.539
[distant cars honking]

132
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.541
You said you wanted to make
the streets safer.

133
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.251
Oh. I meant from murder.

134
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.086
- Ha! Of course.
- Yeah. so... yeah.

135
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.548
'Cause I... I heard your teaser trailer
a while back. then crickets.

136
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.550
So. I have some theories.

137
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.844
Have we looked into the person

138
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.972
who is running against me this fall?

139
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.765
[chuckles] Right?

140
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.767
- [laughing] You guys see?
- Oh! It's a joke.

141
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:51.852
[laughter]

142
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.311
- Joking.
- No. No. no. no. no.

143
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.814
We cannot podcast about that murder.

144
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.150
- What...?
- Because. well. our prime suspects

145
00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.737
bought our network and banned us
from talking about them.

146
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:06.032
Oh. the Wondify sale. Yeah.

147
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.868
Wait.

148
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.787
Is Bash Steed one of your suspects?

149
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.497
Yeah. you know him?

150
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.125
Uh. love him.
I... I... I would be shocked

151
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.127
if he was related to your case.

152
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.964
Actually. um. you know. Romy.
I... I could really use a coffee

153
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.258
- from that bodega on 74th.
- Okay.

154
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.637
Okay. thank you.

155
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.264
- [sighs]
- [door opens and closes]

156
00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.641
Bash Steed is your murderer.

He had me hire her so he could
keep eyes on me all the time.

164

And yes. she also happens
to be the best assistant I've ever had.

she gets coffee. [chuckles]

What makes you think Bash is our suspect?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.966
Well. I... I don't actually
know that for sure.

171

Dammit. Mayor!

172
00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.885
But if you are investigating him
for something.

173
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.513
chances are. he did that something.
Trust me.

whatever it takes to get ahead.

175

So. why are you trying to out him?

177

When I was first running for office.

178
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.565
I was up against people
with deep pockets.

179
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.111
I didn't stand a chance.
until Bash opened up his checkbook.

180
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.447
But it turns out. if people
give you money. you owe them later.

181

One time. I took a small loan

182
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.493
- from Robert Blake. He was...
- Oliver!

183

Uh. s... Real quick.

184
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:18.248
He made me lie under oath.
Continue. please.

185
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.959
Uh. okay.
Well. uh. it started out small.

186
00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:24.087
Uh. building permits.
diplomatic license plates.

187
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.797
But then the asks kept getting bigger.

188
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.675
Now. I'm spending so much time
doing his bidding.

189

I haven't made good
on any of my campaign promises.

190

191
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.890

and stop simping

192

193

Talk to the chief of police.

194

is the NYPD's biggest donor?

195

I threw myself into this case
