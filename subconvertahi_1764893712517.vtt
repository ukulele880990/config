[Nancy] All right.

361
00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:58.765
So. assuming Murray's intel is correct.

362
00:25:58.848 --> 00:26:02.310
the supply convoy is set
to reach Hawkins at 10:00 sharp.

363
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.729
Meaning I want Hopper in the tunnels

364
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:07.524
and en route to MAC-Z no later than 9:00.

365
00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:09.818
Lucas. we'll take
our usual observation post.

366
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.820
[Nancy] Barring unusual traffic.

367
00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.406
I expect the convoy
to reach MAC-Z at 10:15.

368
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:16.450
Once the burn starts
and there's sufficient cover.

369
00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:18.582
we'll signal Hopper. who'll make his move.

370
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.246
And now the crawl begins.

371
00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:23.623
Hop is now in the Upside Down.

372
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:26.751
traveling at what I hope to be
a gentle 30 miles an hour.

373
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:27.669
which will allow...

374
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.047
...you and Harrington to follow along
in the Rightside Up.

375
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.674
Just remember. try and keep
the telemetry signal within...

376
00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:35.802
Negative 60 and negative 70 dB.
Easy-peasy.

377
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:38.388
I expect the convoy
to take the same route as last month.

378
00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:40.557
Main to Cornwallis. one turn.

379
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.351
But if you guys hit any red lights...

380
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.603
-I'll blow through.
-Only if there's no MPs around.

381
00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:48.732
Remember. if you guys get pulled over.
we lose Hop. we're toast.

382
00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:49.899
I got it.

383
00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:53.111
You're gonna travel up Cornwallis
for about six miles.

384
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.156
And as the convoy reaches
this Shell station here...

385
00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:57.866
We radio Hop to disembark.

386
00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:00.118
Which will drop the old man
at the border of G1.

387
00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:05.540
Where he'll have two whole hours
to search for Vecna. which is ample time.

388
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.876
He's cleared zones much faster.

389
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:12.547
So. all in all.

[Jonathan clears throat]

391
00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:15.884
Is there a problem?

392
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.136
[Jonathan] Um...

393
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.057
No. No. I mean. I think it's good.

394
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.018
Yeah. yeah. it's good. It's really good.

395
00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:26.102
It's just. um...

396
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:30.106
Zone G1 is not that exciting or Vecna-y.

397
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.985
What does it have? A Circuit
City. a couple of houses. and a...

398
00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:37.072
Big Buy? What are the chances
Vecna's shopping for Lucky Charms?

399
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.907
It doesn't matter. We stick to the plan.

400
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.785
We break into the Upside Down
the only way we can.

401
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:44.121
through the MAC-Z gate.
under the cover of a burn.

402
00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:47.082
Once inside. we search
one zone at a time. methodically.

403
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.214
until we figure out
where he's been hiding.

404
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.669
Unless...

405
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.088
he's already dead.

406
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:55.490
Again. your plan is great. It's just...

407
00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:58.343
This is crawl what? Are we in the 30s now?

408
00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:00.036
And not a single baddie in sight?

409
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.138
El can't find him in her bath.

410
00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:04.808
and Will hasn't had his goosies
since the shake 'n' quake.

411
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:06.643
-Goosies?
-And last we saw Vecna.

412
00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:08.854
he was roasting like a turkey
and pumped full of lead.

413
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:10.606
That was before he fell three stories.

414
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.982
So you ever think
we're scouring a battlefield

415
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:15.735
that we already. like. won?

416
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.863
Have you forgotten what he showed Nancy?
Hawkins on fire.

417
00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:21.199
-Karen. Holly. everyone dead.
-[Steve] Yeah. man.

418
00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:24.453
He also showed Max her brother
walking around with a hole in his chest.

419
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.039
That's what he does. He gets in your head
and tries to scare you.

420
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:30.792
He did a good job because I am scared.
And you should be scared too.

421
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:34.046
Because if he's still out there.
he's planning to end our world. so...

422
00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:37.674
We don't stop looking.
Even if it takes 100 more crawls. 1.000.

423
00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:39.634
We don't stop until we're goddamn sure

is dead and gone and never coming back.

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.335
Great. You did that today.
You can do it again tomorrow.

514
00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:09.213
The crawl is tonight. Hop.
If I'm under 12:30. I can come with you.

515
00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:12.759
-That is what you promised.
-Yeah. I promised that. I promised it.

516
00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:14.635
But I didn't see it.

517
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.764
So blame Diana.

518
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.447
You didn't think
I could make the time. did you?

519
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.617
I think you can. but no. not today.
I don't think you made that time.

520
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.202
Are you saying that I lie?

521
00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:41.037
[Hopper] No. I'm saying you're mistaken.

522
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.622
[Eleven] I'm not mistaken.

523
00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:45.374
[Hopper] Okay. so you're on
your sixth run.

524
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.794
you're totally drained.

525
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:52.548
and you just happen to break
your second record of the day.

526
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.217
right before a crawl.

527
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.426
I don't think so. kid.

528
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.514
You saw the time. I saw you look down.
You have to let me go with you.

529
00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:01.516
You want to find Henry so bad. don't you?

530
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.517
So bad.

531
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.560
Do it. Do it from the tub.

532
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.437
Do it remotely.

533
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.857
You're not coming with me. Not today.

534
00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:11.651
End of story.

535

537
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.457
Why are you being so hard on her?

538
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.584
I'm not being hard on her.

539

[Joyce scoffs]

540
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.171
She's just trying to help.

541
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:33.715
It'd be great if Will could help.

542
00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:36.259
but you keep that kid
wrapped in bubble wrap.

543
00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.302
Come on. That's different.

544
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:39.762
I mean. El...

545
00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:43.057
Look at her. She's... She's ready.

546
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.852
Thirty-seven crawls.

547
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:49.188
The only thing I found
down in that damn place are soldiers.

548
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:50.189
lots of them.

549
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:52.608
And they're all looking
for one person. El.

550
00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:56.321
So there's no reason to put her life
on the line and bring her down there.

551
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:59.407
especially not for some recon mission.

552
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.661
Well. if it's just some recon mission.
then what's with all the guns?

553
00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.955
It's in case I run into trouble.

554
00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:08.166
-Yeah. or in case you run into him.
-No.

555
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.170
I run into that psychic freak.
I'm tucking tail and running.

556
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:17.049
I'm nuts. I'm nuts. But I'm not that nuts.

[tender. emotional music playing]

558
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:26.434
I'm gonna need El.
I know that. I know that.

559
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:30.938
Which is precisely why
there's no point in risking her life

560
00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:34.192
over some stupid recon crap.

561
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:41.282
I want her primed. but I want her safe.
Safe until the very last minute. okay?

562
00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.535
Yeah. okay.

563
00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:49.290
But her time on that last run.

564
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.791
did she make it?

565
00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:54.128
With a second to spare.

566
00:36:55.421 --> 00:36:56.422

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.712
[Andy] See what Donna was wearing?

569
00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:38.673
She's gone up like two sizes
since last year.

570
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.883
-[boy 1] Yeah. right.
-Jesus Christ!

What are you doing?
Come on. I have to get going.

583
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.022
Sorry.

584
00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.066
They told me to wait.

585
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:55.916
Is this about your mystery friend again?

586
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.543
Mr. Whatsit?

587
00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.881
He's only trying to help.

588
00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:04.342
Help? How?

589
00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.510
By protecting me.

590
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:10.931
He says that there are
monsters in Hawkins.

591
00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.977
and... they like to eat kids like me.

592
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.688
Monsters aren't real. Holly.

593
00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.358
I don't believe you.

594
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.606
I know you're scared
because of everything that's happened.

595
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.034
With the crazy stories people tell.
I mean. I get scared sometimes too.

596
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:31.160
No. you don't.

597
00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:32.370
Are you kidding?

598
00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:34.455
Everyone in Hawkins is scared shitless.

599
00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.291
Anyone who says they aren't
are full of it.

600
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:39.585
Like that mouth breather in your class...
What's his name again?

601
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:41.587
-Derek?
-Yeah. Derek.

602
00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:44.173
He probably wets his bed every night.

603
00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:49.053
Know who I turn to when I get scared?

604
00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.730
Mike the Brave.

605
00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:02.608
He goes on adventures
called dungeon crawls.

606
00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:04.276
What's a dungeon crawl?

607
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.904
Basically. he explores
these underground worlds.

608
00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:10.699
where he fights monsters.
evil wizards. sorcerers and stuff.

609
00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:13.327
But Mike the Brave is never scared.

610
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:17.373
So whenever I'm feeling
frightened or nervous.

611
00:40:17.456 --> 00:40:19.333
I just imagine that he's at my side.

612
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:20.418
and I feel better.

613
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:25.047
So maybe the next time you get scared.
you don't need this Mr. Whatsit.

614
00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:28.801
Maybe you just need Holly the Heroic.

615
00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:31.262
Holly the Heroic?

616
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.826
I was gonna to wait a
few more years. but...

617
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:47.778
She's a cleric.
which means she has divine powers.

618
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.365
She can cast spells of protection
to ward against evil spirits.

619
00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:53.742
and even cooler.
she can cast a dimension door.

620
00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:56.167
which can teleport you
to anywhere you visualize.

621
00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:58.706
I mean. come on.

622
00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.041
Can this lame-o Mr. Whatsit
do any of this?

623
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.043
[chuckles] No.

624
00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:07.965
She'll keep you safe. I promise.

I really haven't felt before.</i>

627
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.979
Mike thinks it could mean
that maybe Vecna's close.

628
00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:24.857
that he's finally re-emerged.

629
00:41:25.357 --> 00:41:29.028
And if he has.
maybe we'll find him tonight.

What do you think. Lucas?

631
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:38.913
Yeah. I think
we'll find him this time for sure.

I'm gonna go grab a Coke
or something caffeinated.

because it's gonna be a long night.

are we gonna be able to afford that?

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:45.784
Violet.

686
00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:49.197
-Is that supposed to be English. freak?
-[jocks laughing]

687
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:53.959
Well. violet Prismatic Spray
is the deadliest. You know why?

688
00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.463
It causes blindness.

689
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.091
Hey!

690
00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:06.638
[Dustin screams]

691
00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:31.369
[Andy] Hellfire dies with you. Henderson.

692
00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.040
And it dies tonight.

693
00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:50.390
[Lucas] <i>Dustin. this is Lucas.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

694
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:53.060
<i>Dustin. do you copy? Over.</i>

695
00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:57.397
Dustin. you're an hour late. man.
You're making us nervous.

696
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.191
We need you here at the Squawk.

697
00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:02.444
Dustin. if you can hear us.
please respond. Over.

698
00:47:02.528 --> 00:47:04.864
I got off the phone with his mom.
She hasn't heard from him.

699
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:07.616
-Christ. Henderson.
-He'll show. He always shows.

700
00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:08.617
Try him again.

701
00:47:09.117 --> 00:47:11.745
Come in. Dustin. Are you there?
Earth to Dustin.

702
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:13.998
This is serious. man. Quit playing.
We can't wait around.

703
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:16.083
[sweet. emotional music playing]

704
00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:19.336
[Lucas] Get your ass to the Squawk.

705
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:21.547
We can't wait around.
We need you here now.

706
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.298
This is not funny. Are you there?

707
00:47:23.382 --> 00:47:24.299
[music trails off]

708
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.176
Dustin. is everything okay?

709
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:29.680
-[Eleven] <i>Do you think Dustin is okay?</i>
-[Lucas] Dustin!

710
00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:31.598
I hope so.

711
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.476
He was acting weird today.

712
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:37.145
-Weird how?
-[Mike sighs]

713
00:47:37.729 --> 00:47:42.150
Just angry. scared. reckless. Not himself.

714
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.820
[Eleven] Hopper's the same.

715
00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.697
Not himself.

716
00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:52.619
Maybe it's just getting to us. you know?

717
00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:56.832
Being... Being stuck in here.
not knowing where Vecna is.

718
00:47:56.915 --> 00:47:58.041
no end in sight.

719
00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.836
I mean. we're really starting to lose it.

720
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:03.797
I mean. we really need to catch a break.

721
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.135
And maybe we will.
Because earlier. Will had a feeling.

722
00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.388
-If Will has a feeling...
-Then it means something.

723
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:13.640
So... So. maybe tonight's our break.

724
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:15.142
Maybe even our last crawl.

725
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.854
We find Vecna.
and we end this once and for all.

726
00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.901
And then what happens?

727
00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:26.904
You mean after you totally demolish Vecna?

728
00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.280
[chuckles softly]

729
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:32.284
In my campaigns. if the party wins.
then they all live happily ever after.

730
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.953
Happily how?

731
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:40.792
Well. usually what happens is the party
doesn't return to their local village.

732
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:42.753
because too much has happened.

733
00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:44.880
They've seen too much.

734
00:48:44.963 --> 00:48:48.216
So they travel to a faraway land.
a... a peaceful land.

735
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.137
somewhere beautiful.
with like three waterfalls or something.

736
00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:55.557
and they all start again. together.

737
00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:57.017
[hopeful synth music playing]

738
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.188
Do you think that could be real for us?

739
00:49:01.813 --> 00:49:03.690
Yeah. of course.

740
00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:09.821
I mean. not the three waterfalls part.
But the other stuff. yeah. of course.

741
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:14.451
If Vecna's gone. then what's stopping us?

742
00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:19.373
Hey. lovebirds! Chief's almost ready.

743
00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:21.625
Let's do this. Come on.

744
00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:36.515
Thank you.

745
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.644
Here.

746
00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:41.728
Good luck.

747
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.440
-Tag's active.
-[Robin] Copy.

748
00:49:47.734 --> 00:49:50.124
Harrington. you getting any signal?
Tag is active.

749
00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.698
Yeah. just give me a second.

750
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:04.542
Hey. anybody know
how Henderson's wheelie thing works?

751
00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:05.919
Uh. any ideas?

752
00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:08.839
There's a safety lock.
Look for a small switch under the wheel.

753
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:11.717
[Robin] <i>There should be
a safety lock under the wheel.</i>

754
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.261
Safety lock. real necessary.

755
00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.313
Okay.

756
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.986
Okay. getting a signal.

757
00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:33.238
It's pretty quiet. though.

758
00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.201
[faint staticky pulsing]

759
00:50:39.661 --> 00:50:41.329
[pulsing accelerates]

760
00:50:42.914 --> 00:50:45.500
Okay. signal's holding a steady 90 dB.

761
00:50:45.584 --> 00:50:49.171
But how am I supposed to monitor this
and drive without Henderson?

762
00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.090
Uh. hear anything from Inspector Gadget?

763
00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:53.175
Nothing.

764
00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.469
I can do it. I... I can monitor.

765
00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:56.845
No. You're staying here.

766
00:50:56.928 --> 00:50:59.598
Mom. I helped Dustin set up the antenna.
I know how to work it.

767
00:50:59.681 --> 00:51:02.184
Out of the question.
It... It's just a wheel.

768
00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:03.393
It's not just a wheel.

769
00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:05.428
Jonathan. you... you can work it. right?

770
00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.065
[Jonathan sighs]

771
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.983
Yeah. yeah. I mean. I think so.

772
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.277
You better not think. You better know.

773
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.409
You lose me out there.
I'm not coming home.

774
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.989
I can handle it.

775
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.388
[Steve] You comfortable back there. Byers?

776
00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.299
Or you want me to get you a pillow?

777
00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:39.721
Just focus on driving.

778
00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:07.833
Try to get back to me in one piece. okay?

779
00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:11.545
[breathing heavily]

780
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.256
What?

781
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.424
Sorry. I'm just looking at you.

782
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.552
You get more beautiful every day.

783
00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.554
[tender. emotional music playing]

784
00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:22.681
How is that fair?

785
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.183
You didn't answer my question.

786
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:26.476
I know.

787
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.728
You didn't answer mine.

788
00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:35.235
[music trailing off]

789
00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:10.729
[Karen] Look. she was standing
at the fence. talking into thin air.

790
00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:12.481
[Ted] She probably was talking to herself.

791
00:53:12.564 --> 00:53:14.233
[Karen] ...standing
there talking to nobody.

792
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:18.278
[Ted] Well. she's hardly the first child
to have an imaginary friend. Karen.

793
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.656
I wouldn't be so worried
if she was five years old.

794
00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:22.199
but she's not five anymore. is she?

795
00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:25.285
In fact. do you even know
how old your daughter is?

796
00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.663
-Oh. you don't even know how old she is!
-You're ridiculous.

797
00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:29.790
[Ted] I'm not talking to you
when you're like this.

798
00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.125
First one tonight.
or already onto number two?

799
00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:33.585
[Karen] Does it matter?

[Lucas chewing loudly]

805
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:06.542
Do you have to chew so loud?

806
00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:08.388
Snipers chew gum.

807
00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.806
You're not a sniper.

808
00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:15.645
Package incoming.
Four trucks. outer east gate on Main.

809

We got action.
Four trucks. outer east gate on Main.

810

-[Lucas] Clear to the east.
-East is clear.

822

I mean. speak for yourself.
I still gotta jump out of this thing.

849
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:42.310
And is it me.
or are we moving faster than normal?

850
00:58:42.393 --> 00:58:43.436
A little faster.

851

-Just aim for the grass.
-[Hopper laughs]

852
00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:49.631
I was gonna go for the asphalt.
but now that you mention the grass...
