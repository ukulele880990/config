1
00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.082
Okay. turn left up here.

2
00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:09.558
And can you step on the gas a little?

3
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.043
Off the gas. Off the gas.

4
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.483
Does somebody else
wanna drive here?

5
00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.560
Phoebe. the demon is not
waiting around for us

6
00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:20.923
to come and vanquish him.

7
00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.239
We don't even know if we have
the power to vanquish him.

8
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.047
Scrying for random evil
tells us nothing.

9
00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:26.483
It tells us where the demons are.

10
00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.446
and since we vanquished
two already this week.

11
00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.281
- I'd say it's working pretty well.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.007
Thanks to Cole
for saving our butts.

13
00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.680
Two witches and a half a demon
does not the power of three make.

14
00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:37.123
So. what are we supposed to do?

15
00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.166
Sit around and wait for them
to pick us all off?

16
00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.604
If we weren't going after them.
they'd be coming after us.

17
00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.248
They're coming after you
anyway. Piper.

18
00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.969
- The Source is coming after you.
- And we won't be ready for him

19
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.484
because instead of teaching Paige
how to be a witch.

20
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.325
we are out hunting for every Tom.
Dick and Beelzebub in San Francisco.

21
00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:54.962
Speaking of.
do we have a plan. or...?

22
00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.687
- The plan is vanquish the demon.
- Great.

23
00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:58.646
Have you mastered your powers.
or are you still freezing

24
00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.003
- and exploding at random?
- Random.

25
00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:02.444
But you know what they say.
there's nothing like field practice.

26
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.724

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:14.246
Stop.

29
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.329
Hey. Big. scary demon.

30
00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.601
He's gonna blow.

31
00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:36.041
Next?

32
00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.799
"Throughout history.
witches have been misunderstood.

33
00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.368
persecuted and destroyed.

34
00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.759
The public hanging. drowning
and burning of women

35
00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.124
suspected of witchcraft
is a far more recent chapter

36
00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.881
of our history
than most people realize. "

37
00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.198
Paige.

38
00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.888
Yeah?

39
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.166
What's the hold-up
on the O' Brien application?

40
00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.081
Well. at the moment. the only hold-up
is my boss. who's standing over me.

41
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.558
distracting me from my work.

42
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.718
Nice teeth.

43
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.527
Have it on my desk by noon.

44
00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.123
Lila.

45
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.802
What's the O'Brien application?

46
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.921
Adam O'Brien? The foster kid we're
trying to get into the boarding school?

47
00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.088
Oh. my God.

48
00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.598
The scholarship application
is due. like. today.

49
00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.646
I'm so lame.

50
00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.799
Oh. Billy. I thought I told you to throw
anything from creditors in the trash.

51
00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.600
Hi. pizza-face.

52
00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.518
Look. I understand how difficult
it is to tear yourself away

53
00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.168
from the cleavage in this section.

54
00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.805
but I'm gonna need my mail
sometime today. okay?

55
00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:00.163
No problem.

56
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.363
Go. go.

57
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.527
Nice rug.

58
00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.242
What the hell?

59
00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.321
Look at him.
What happened to his hair?

60
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.919
I didn't know he was bald!

61
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.682
Oh. I know that you're happy
that we got him. Piper.

62
00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.522
but is it entirely necessary
to disfigure the Book?

63
00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.726
This one could incinerate
human flesh with his eyes.

64
00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.800
That must sting.

65
00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.681
You think that's funny?

66
00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.243
You could've gotten yourself killed.
Do you understand that?

67
00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.400
Yes. Cole. I understand "killed"
very well.

68
00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.958
Then why would you wanna keep
risking your life and Phoebe's?

69
00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.244
Not to mention mine.

70
00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.161
There's a legion
of bounty hunters on my ass.

71
00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:54.321
I'm supposed to be laying low. but
instead I'm out protecting you guys.

72
00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.407
You know what. Cole?
Next time you can stay home.

73
00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.767
If you insist on taking these suicide
missions. you force me to be there.

74
00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:03.727
because there's no way in hell I'm
gonna let Phoebe lose another sister.

75
00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.244
Why don't you go see
who's at the door for us. okay?

76
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.728
Sure.

77
00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.926
If it's The Source.
I'll just ask him to come back later.

78
00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.886
We need to talk.

79
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.562
Piper. Cole's right. We have
a system for fighting demons.

80
00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.560
and it's worked pretty well
the last three years.

81
00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.519
I think Prue being killed counts
as a pretty big glitch in the system.

82
00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.044
I know that you're angry.
I am angry too.

83
00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:31.642
Then why are you fighting me
on this?

84
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.243
What's...? What is the problem
with getting a little proactive?

85
00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.243
Because we're not ready
to get proactive.

86
00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.922
That's what's wrong with it.

87
00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.886
We're barely ready for anything
right now.

88
00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.684
Just dealing with our everyday
normal lives is hard enough.

89
00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.248
That is precisely the point.

90
00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:47.842
The faster we get rid
of these demons.

91
00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.159
the faster we can get back
to our everyday normal lives.

92
00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:51.603
or at least what is left of them.

93
00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:53.678
Knock-knock.

94
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.168
I...

95
00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:59.837
I'm sorry to just drop by
without calling.

96
00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:02.520
It's okay. don't worry about it.

97
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.602
I don't know exactly why I'm here.
I'm just kind of having a hard time

98
00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:08.919
being surrounded by people. and...

99
00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:11.922
And not be able to tell them that you
can move things with your mind?

100
00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:16.086
It does not exactly
roll off the tongue.

101
00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.519
Yeah. Well. being a witch
is tough on friendships.

102
00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.725
That's why the whole sister thing
comes in so handy.

103
00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.481
What are you doing?

104
00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:27.322
It's a little chatty up here. so I'm
gonna go scry for evil in my room.

105
00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.487
Scry?

106
00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:30.798
Yeah.

107
00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.168
Phoebe will explain.

108
00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:34.967
I'll see you later.

109
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.161
It's kind of like
a supernatural LoJack.

110
00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.239
Well. why don't you just use
that big book?

111
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.446
I mean. it is a book of spells. right?

112
00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.208
Oh. it's a lot more than that.

113
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.728
It's kind of hard to explain.

114
00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:55.922
It looks so old.

115
00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:58.962
Yeah. It has survived a lot.

116
00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.924
Fortunately. it protects
itself from evil.

117
00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:04.126
It protects itself? How?

118
00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:05.718
Magic.

119
00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.323
May I?

120
00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.278
Yeah. Technically. it's yours too.

121
00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.007
I would walk you through it
right now.

122
00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.887
but I have to go talk to Cole.

123
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.440
Well. maybe I can just
take it back to my office.

124
00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.605
Oh. no. no. No.

125
00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:24.122
It doesn't leave the house.

126
00:07:24.489 --> 00:07:26.127
But just feel free
to thumb through it.

127
00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.405
And then I'll be back
in a few minutes.

128
00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:40.038
This could solve a lot of problems.

129
00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.681
- What? What is it? What's wrong?
- You've got to talk to your wife.

130
00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:54.965
Okay. Cole. Remember what I said
about being gentle?

131
00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:57.880
- What about my wife?
- She's out of control.

132
00:07:58.169 --> 00:07:59.363
Cole.

133
00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:00.843
What?

134
00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:03.205
It's just we're very worried
about her.

135
00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:04.878
What happened?

136
00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:06.243
She's very. very angry.

137
00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:08.360
Well. of course she's angry.
She's grieving.

138
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.121
Right. And if she were
punching walls.

139
00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.722
I would happily call a repairman.

140
00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:13.766
The problem is she prefers
to punch demons.

141
00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:18.328
- Well. I'll talk to her.
- She has no regard for her own life.

142
00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:20.719
Or anyone else's.
She's Charles Bronson. cubed.

143
00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:22.726
I said I'd talk to her.

144
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.000
Guys. Guys.

145
00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:27.528
Who is Charles Bronson?

146
00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:32.728
Never mind. We...

147
00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:34.686
Can we please just have
a minute alone?

148
00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.001
- Sure.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:45.321
It's not just that she's violent. Leo.
she's acting nothing like herself.

150
00:08:45.489 --> 00:08:49.164
She's completely
dismissive of Paige. and...

151
00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:51.928
I don't know what to do anymore.

152
00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:54.247
Strange. isn't it?

153
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.560
Now on top of everything else.
you have to play the middle sister.

154
00:08:57.729 --> 00:08:59.799
When you've always been the...

155
00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:01.920
Screwup?

156
00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:03.761
The youngest.

157
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.239
Yeah. I look at Paige and Piper.

158
00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:08.240
and it makes me think back
to all those times

159
00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:11.367
that Piper had to play mediator
between me and Prue.

160
00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:13.528
Not a lot of fun. huh?

161
00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:16.006
It's not a job I would've asked for.

162
00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:20.845
And I'm not sure it's a job
I'm gonna be any good at. but...

163
00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:24.640
I just... I don't have time
to really worry about it right now.

164
00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:27.486
I'll talk to her.

165
00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:30.041
Thanks. Leo.

166
00:09:30.609 --> 00:09:33.646
Not to rush this tender moment.
but she's already started scrying.

167
00:09:37.729 --> 00:09:40.448
I didn't mean
you couldn't use the stairs.

168
00:09:57.449 --> 00:10:00.009
Okay. book. Protect yourself.

169
00:10:08.529 --> 00:10:11.123
Paige? I'll be right up.

170
00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:15.680
- Where's the fire?
- Oh. you know. work.

171
00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:17.487
Lunch break's over. Gotta go.

172
00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.207
But we didn't even get to talk.

173
00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.246
Oh. yeah. It's all right. Don't worry.

174
00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:22.728
Will you come by later?

175
00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.641
Sure. Yeah. absolutely.

176
00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:26.322
Bye.

177
00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:29.968
Bye.

178
00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:35.244
Look. honey...

179
00:10:35.729 --> 00:10:37.879
...it isn't just that it's dangerous.

180
00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:41.007
Leo. whitelighters are supposed
to guide. not judge.

181
00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:43.239
Just because I'm doing things
a little bit differently

182
00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.842
doesn't mean
that there is a problem.

183
00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:46.488
Piper. I'm your husband...

184
00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:47.877
...not just your whitelighter.

185
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:50.438
And when you speak to me like that.
there is a problem.

186
00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:53.357
I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

187
00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:57.168
It hurts to talk. Leo.

188
00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:59.559
It hurts to breathe.

189
00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:03.525
So unless you have some idea
of how to bring Prue back.

190
00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:05.520
I don't wanna talk right now.

191
00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:09.641
Is that what you don't wanna say?

192
00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:12.277
Is that you still blame me
for not being able to bring her back?

193
00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:15.009
No. Leo. I don't blame you.

194
00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:16.363
I blame evil.

195
00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:19.089
Why...? Why do you think
I am doing all of this?

196
00:11:19.249 --> 00:11:20.648
- For kicks?
- Honestly?

197
00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:22.487
I think you're doing it
because it's easier

198
00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.083
than confronting
what you're really feeling.

199
00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:32.757
- Demon.
- What?

200
00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:34.163
I have work to do.

201
00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:38.769
Cole. Phoebe. let's go.

202
00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:50.799
Nothing like a copy room
with a view.

203
00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.767
Hey. Clearasil.

204
00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:57.601
What's popping?

205
00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:04.163
Don't worry about him. Billy.
He's a jerk to everybody.

206
00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:05.682
Yeah. I know.

207
00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:07.680
That's why his mail gets lost.

208
00:12:07.849 --> 00:12:09.487
Frequently.

209
00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:13.357
Hey. is there something wrong
with this copier?

210
00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:15.281
The copier? I don't think so.

211
00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:17.041
I just ran off a whole bunch.

212
00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:18.967
Everything keeps coming up blank.

213
00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:22.089
Are you trying to copy a book?

214
00:12:22.289 --> 00:12:24.325
No. It's nothing. It's cool.

215
00:12:24.489 --> 00:12:27.925
Well. if you need me to do it for you.
just say the word.

216
00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:29.687
Thanks. You're sweet.

217
00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:47.042
Let the object of objection
Become but a dream

218
00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:49.928
As I cause the seen
To be unseen

219
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:54.962
- You okay. Billy?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:58.201
I just... I got a little head rush.

221
00:13:03.729 --> 00:13:05.526
Oh. my God. It worked.

222
00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:11.325
Oh. my God.

223
00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:16.162
Paige? Is everything okay?

224
00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:18.959
It will be from now on.

225
00:13:25.569 --> 00:13:28.003
Piper. Cole and I do not
support you in this.

226
00:13:28.169 --> 00:13:30.319
If you insist on doing it.
you're going in alone.

227
00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:32.008
Okay. I'll see you at home.

228
00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:33.363
I told you that wouldn't work.

229
00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:35.087
- It was worth a shot.
- Wait a minute.

230
00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:37.080
Do you smell smoke?

231
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:39.563
It's in there.

232
00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:45.726
Stop. Stop. No...

233
00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:53.564
Get back. I'll blow it up.

234
00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:54.878
Go on.

235
00:13:59.729 --> 00:14:01.367
- Piper?
- Yeah. yeah.

236
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.803
Crap.

237
00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:05.327
Okay.

238
00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:12.121
Piper.

239
00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:14.041
- What?
- Cole.

240
00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:24.762
Piper. let them go.

241
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:37.839
They're... They're immune
to my powers.

242
00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:39.847
Unfortunately. Cole isn't.

243
00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:52.442
- Piper. unfreeze him.
- What if I blow him up?

244
00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:00.167
Cole.

245
00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:20.079
I'm gonna take out those
chain-smoking bitches

246
00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:22.126
if it's the last thing I do.

247
00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:23.961
It might be the last thing you do.

248
00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:26.848
That's very supportive. Cole.
Whose side are you on?

249
00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:28.442
At the moment.
I'm on Phoebe's side.

250
00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:31.881
Well. the last time I checked.
Phoebe was still my sister.

251
00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:33.528
which technically puts her
on my side.

252
00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:35.407
- Why are we arguing?
- We're not arguing.

253
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:37.685
We're discussing. Piper.
You are arguing.

254
00:15:37.849 --> 00:15:39.805
- And look. you're already hurt.
- I'm fine.

255
00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:42.358
- You can't stop coughing.
- And your control over your powers

256
00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:44.008
seems to be getting worse.
not better.

257
00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:46.205
Well. our powers
are tied to our emotions.

258
00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:48.929
so it makes sense that they
would be a little off right now.

259
00:15:49.089 --> 00:15:52.286
All the more reason to lay low.
These demons are dangerous.

260
00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:54.838
All the more reason
to vanquish them. okay?

261
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:56.761
That is what we do. Eliminate evil.

262
00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:59.238
Regardless of the consequences.
Now you sound like Prue.

263
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:03.159
Okay. Cole. I'm going to vanquish
the cancer girls

264
00:16:03.369 --> 00:16:04.643
with or without your help.

265
00:16:04.809 --> 00:16:07.004
So either tell me what you know.
or get out of the way.

266
00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.806
They're called Furies.

267
00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:16.002
- Like from mythology?
- The dog-faced women from hell?

268
00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:18.603
They're modern knockoffs.
Their m. o. is the same. though.

269
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:20.487
- They punish evildoers?
- Exactly.

270
00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:21.968
Wait. Wouldn't that
make them good?

271
00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:23.602
Well. these Furies
have no temperance.

272
00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:25.760
They'll go after a shoplifter
as soon as a murderer.

273
00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:27.567
and they take
great pleasure in the kill.

274
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:30.608
Great. Then we'll take
great pleasure in the vanquish.

275
00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.520
What aren't you telling us?

276
00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:42.925
So they go after evildoers.
Have they attacked you before?

277
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:47.368
When they focus
their thoughts on you.

278
00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:50.999
they force you to hear the cries
of all your former victims.

279
00:16:51.169 --> 00:16:53.478
You're not the demon
who did those things anymore.

280
00:17:05.489 --> 00:17:06.604
Evil got the Book of Shadows.

281
00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:08.202
How did evil
get the Book of Shadows?

282
00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.166
- Oh. no.
- Oh. no. Phoebe?

283
00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.728
A demon has
the Book of Shadows.

284
00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:13.288
"Oh. no" doesn't quite cover it.

285
00:17:13.489 --> 00:17:15.719
- Let me go see what I can find out.
- No. wait.

286
00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:17.322
Piper?

287
00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:19.081
Promise me you're not
gonna overreact.

288
00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:21.201
Is that even possible?

289
00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.561
I think that maybe...

290
00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:28.927
Well. it might...
Might be feasible that...

291
00:17:30.329 --> 00:17:32.559
...Paige borrowed the Book.

292
00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:36.164
What? Why...? Why...?

293
00:17:36.329 --> 00:17:38.047
Why would you think that?

294
00:17:38.209 --> 00:17:40.643
See. now. this is what I meant
about overreacting.

295
00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:42.362
- It's just that I...
- You let Paige

296
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:44.121
take the Book of Shadows
out of the manor?

297
00:17:44.289 --> 00:17:47.679
Well. no. I did not let her.
It's just. she left pretty quick...

298
00:17:49.129 --> 00:17:53.247
- ... and it looks like she might have...
- Out of the window?

299
00:17:53.409 --> 00:17:54.922
- Piper. I am...
- Phoebe. why would you

300
00:17:55.089 --> 00:17:56.647
even leave her alone with it?

301
00:17:57.329 --> 00:17:58.762
Well. because she's our sister.

302
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:01.517
Not for long.

303
00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:14.727
- Are you coming?
- To vanquish your sister?

304
00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:16.447
I think I'll sit this one out.

305
00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:24.958
It's unbelievable.

306
00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:26.926
Maybe it was the light
from the copy machine.

307
00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:28.522
God. this day is amazing.

308
00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:30.884
- I mean. you went and got cute.
- You think?

309
00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:34.280
Totally. And then my car loan comes
through. like. out of nowhere.

310
00:18:34.449 --> 00:18:36.201
My credit is worse than Paige's.

311
00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:39.486
- You know. I still can't believe all this.
- This is amazing.

312
00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:42.641
Sir. I am taking full responsibility
for being late with the application.

313
00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:44.765
I'm simply asking
for a deadline extension.

314
00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:46.282
Well. I can't give you a deadline...

315
00:18:46.449 --> 00:18:48.440
Well. I'm asking that you
not punish Adam O'Brien.

316
00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:50.679
who's already had
a tough enough life. for my mistake.

317
00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:52.646
Someone has to straighten
this thing out.

318
00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:53.958
Sir. all I'm saying is...

319
00:18:56.689 --> 00:18:58.281
These words will travel
Through the minds

320
00:18:58.449 --> 00:18:59.768
Of stubborn parties and unbind

321
00:18:59.969 --> 00:19:03.245
The thoughts too rigid to be kind
A compromise they'll disentwine

322
00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:05.762
How does 6;00 on Friday sound?

323
00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:07.965
Six o'clock Friday is perfect.

324
00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:10.120
Thank you so much.

325
00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:12.685
- Victory.
- You got the extension?

326
00:19:12.849 --> 00:19:15.079
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable.

327
00:19:15.249 --> 00:19:17.285
You're into all that
witchy stuff. right?

328
00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:19.408
- Excuse me?
- Well. I'm just thinking

329
00:19:19.569 --> 00:19:21.400
that there must be something
in the stars today.

330
00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:23.804
I mean. Billy's face.
my car. now this.

331
00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:25.965
Is there a full moon or something?

332
00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:28.283
I don't know. but whatever it is.

333
00:19:28.449 --> 00:19:31.088
I'm gonna call my student-loan sharks
and take full advantage of it.

334
00:19:31.569 --> 00:19:33.525
Oh. good. Me too.

335
00:19:35.689 --> 00:19:39.443
You know. Paige. as a lawyer.

336
00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:43.602
I could get those nasty creditors
off your back so easily.

337
00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:45.805
And if you can't afford to pay me.

338
00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:48.847
I could always
just take it out in trade.

339
00:19:49.009 --> 00:19:51.159
Or I could just sue your ass
for sexual harassment.

340
00:19:51.329 --> 00:19:54.366
And pay you with my big fat
punitive settlement.

341
00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:56.361
The way you dress?

342
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.724
The judge would admire
my restraint.

343
00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:02.325
That's it.

344
00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:08.805
Perfect. I'll just change "demon"
to "dirtbag. "

345
00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:12.647
I don't understand
how someone can be that stupid.

346
00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:14.765
I don't understand why
you haven't stopped ranting

347
00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:16.123
since we left the house.

348
00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:18.280
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

349
00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:20.804
- Yes. Paige made a mistake.
- A mistake?

350
00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:23.278
- She stole from us.
- She borrowed. Borrowed.

351
00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:27.681
She... She threw our family heritage
out of the window.

352
00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:31.728
Well. that's because we never took
the time to explain its significance.

353
00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:33.117
It was just a book to her.

354
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:34.881
Okay. Phoebe. it is not just a book.

355
00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:38.837
It's like... It is like part of our family.

356
00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:43.083
Paige is not a killer.
She didn't kill anyone.

357
00:20:43.249 --> 00:20:45.444
And she's not a demon
that we're on our way to vanquish.

358
00:20:45.609 --> 00:20:46.803
- I get that. Phoebe.
- Do you?

359
00:20:46.969 --> 00:20:48.687
Because I don't think that you do.

360
00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.043
- You all right...?
- Hey.

361
00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:52.200
Get away from me. Hey.

362
00:20:54.089 --> 00:20:56.159
- What the hell is going on?
- This is not funny.

363
00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:59.321
Oh. Donnie. Give mama some sugar.

364
00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:03.323
Who's the man? You are.

365
00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:06.289
You are so...

366
00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:10.766
...busted?

367
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:12.683
Hello.

368
00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:14.965
You stole our sacred book

369
00:21:15.129 --> 00:21:17.882
so you could perform magical
plastic surgery on yourself?

370
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:19.323
You think I did this on purpose?

371
00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:21.798
My body was perfectly fine
just as it was. thank you.

372
00:21:21.969 --> 00:21:24.483
I mean it. Get away from me!

373
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:30.166
Piper. you could've just blown up
a dozen innocent people.

374
00:21:30.329 --> 00:21:32.797
- I took a chance.
- See? Are you listening to yourself?

375
00:21:32.969 --> 00:21:36.200
- What happened?
- I don't know. They just grew.

376
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:38.918
Oh. right. And you had
nothing to do with that.

377
00:21:39.129 --> 00:21:40.847
Did you cast any spells?

378
00:21:42.209 --> 00:21:43.801
One.

379
00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:46.362
- Five.
- Five?

380
00:21:47.609 --> 00:21:50.442
Okay. what did you do just before
you turned into Betty Boop?

381
00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:54.001
Well. I cast a spell on the slimeball
I work with

382
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:56.444
so I could give him a taste
of his own medicine.

383
00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.526
That the slimeball?

384
00:22:01.649 --> 00:22:03.162
And that's the backfire.

385
00:22:04.129 --> 00:22:05.687
- Backfire?
- You misused magic

386
00:22:05.849 --> 00:22:07.567
to make him the object of ogling.

387
00:22:07.729 --> 00:22:10.038
and the spell backfired
and did the same thing to you.

388
00:22:10.249 --> 00:22:12.319
Which you would've learned
if you had bothered to ask.

389
00:22:12.489 --> 00:22:14.002
but now. instead
of vanquishing demons.

390
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:17.201
we're gonna have to spend
the afternoon fixing your mess.

391
00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:22.321
Okay. Piper. call Leo and get him
to orb this slimeball back home.

392
00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:25.646
We have to protect him until we can
figure out a way to reverse the spell.

393
00:22:25.849 --> 00:22:28.443
Paige and I will grab the Book
and meet you there.

394
00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:40.004
Are my boobs gonna stay
this way forever?

395
00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:42.406
Not if I can ever find the spell.

396
00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:44.162
What about Piper?

397
00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:45.887
She gonna stay mad at me forever?

398
00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:49.287
No. It's just...

399
00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:51.565
...she hasn't really
been herself lately.

400
00:22:51.729 --> 00:22:54.402
You know. a lot of ups and downs...

401
00:22:54.569 --> 00:22:57.242
...since Prue...
You know? Like us all.

402
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:59.684
The last thing I wanted to do
was add to your guys' stress.

403
00:22:59.849 --> 00:23:02.568
I just wanted to get back at Donnie.

404
00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:05.329
Yeah. and I understand
the temptation. Paige. I really do.

405
00:23:05.489 --> 00:23:07.684
But I told you. the Book
does not leave the house.

406
00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:09.800
Right. Sorry.

407
00:23:11.249 --> 00:23:13.365
My boobs are in the way.

408
00:23:13.569 --> 00:23:15.605
Can you put it into third for me?

409
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.283
All right. Ready? Here we go.

410
00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:20.722
All right.

411
00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:22.238
Did you find the spell yet?

412
00:23:22.449 --> 00:23:25.646
No. but I found the demons.

413
00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:27.328
- Oh. my God.
- What?

414
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.049
You can't say "demons" followed
by "Oh. my God. " I'm new at this.

415
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:32.677
- I'm likely to panic.
- Okay.

416
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:34.807
Fury smoke kills bad guys. right?

417
00:23:34.969 --> 00:23:39.087
But in good people. it looks
for a portal of unexpressed fury.

418
00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:42.207
- And?
- It builds until it consumes

419
00:23:42.369 --> 00:23:45.486
your humanity.
and it turns you into a Fury.

420
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:47.446
We fought the Furies today.

421
00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:49.122
Piper got smoked.

422
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.397
Wait. Are you saying
that Piper is turning into a demon?

423
00:23:53.049 --> 00:23:54.641
It wouldn't be the first time.

424
00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:57.798
Step on it and hit the clutch.
I'm going into fourth. Ready?

425
00:23:58.009 --> 00:23:59.806
On three. One. two. three.

426
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:05.127
Easy. Piper.

427
00:24:05.289 --> 00:24:06.847
What. are you protecting him now?

428
00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:08.528
What the hell's going on?

429
00:24:08.689 --> 00:24:10.680
And what's with the chicks?
They've gone crazy.

430
00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:14.239
This chick just saved your ass.
you snivelling ingrate.

431
00:24:15.969 --> 00:24:18.563
- Do you see what I mean?
- Who said you could get up?

432
00:24:21.569 --> 00:24:23.685
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh. my God.

433
00:24:23.849 --> 00:24:25.726
Okay. honey. look.
I don't know what's going on.

434
00:24:25.889 --> 00:24:27.208
but we really need to talk.

435
00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:29.880
Leo. you know what?

436
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:31.528
I'm sick of talking.

437
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:38.121
Now we really need to talk.

438
00:24:38.329 --> 00:24:42.208
Piper. you do not use your powers
on a mortal. do you hear me?

439
00:24:42.489 --> 00:24:44.957
Back away slowly. Leo.

440
00:24:46.289 --> 00:24:47.768
What?

441
00:24:48.369 --> 00:24:50.439
She's becoming a Fury.

442
00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:53.968
There's no reasoning with her now.

443
00:24:55.049 --> 00:24:58.644
Piper. you're a good witch.
Do you hear me? Fight this.

444
00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:08.288
Oh. God. help.

445
00:25:10.329 --> 00:25:12.001
No!

446
00:25:16.129 --> 00:25:17.448
Cole.

447
00:25:18.569 --> 00:25:19.888
I... Well...

448
00:25:21.329 --> 00:25:23.889
That wasn't very nice.

449
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.087
Cole hit her with an energy ball.

450
00:25:36.249 --> 00:25:37.682
Leo. it was low voltage.

451
00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:39.885
Would you prefer
he'd let her kill an innocent?

452
00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:42.517
I'd prefer that he wouldn't use
his demonic powers on my wife.

453
00:25:42.729 --> 00:25:44.845
I can't believe that you let him
go look for her.

454
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:48.166
This is all my fault. I shouldn't have
stolen the Book of Shadows.

455
00:25:48.329 --> 00:25:49.808
- You stole the Book of Shadows?
- Leo.

456
00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:52.039
Leo. concentrate. please.

457
00:25:52.449 --> 00:25:53.643
I just hope he finds her fast.

458
00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:56.403
because if this is anything
like the time I turned into a banshee.

459
00:25:56.569 --> 00:25:59.129
- she's gonna be hungry for a kill.
- I'm sorry. A banshee?

460
00:25:59.289 --> 00:26:02.167
Yeah. a demonic screamer.
Kind of trampy. feeds on pain.

461
00:26:02.689 --> 00:26:04.839
I think I need to sit down.

462
00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:15.038
- Paige.
- What?

463
00:26:15.209 --> 00:26:17.120
You only said I couldn't use magic
to punish him.

464
00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:18.483
Okay. Leo.

465
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:20.685
You orb Donnie back to his office.

466
00:26:20.849 --> 00:26:23.682
Heal him there. then make sure he
doesn't narc us out for being witches.

467
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:25.805
- How?
- I don't know. Be creative.

468
00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:27.237
What about Piper?

469
00:26:27.449 --> 00:26:30.122
You have to do your job.
and let us do ours.

470
00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:33.119
We'll get your wife back.
I promise.

471
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:45.282
I hate to ask. but how are we
going to get his wife back?

472
00:26:45.449 --> 00:26:47.838
I mean. she's kind of
a full-on demon.

473
00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:50.443
No. she's not full-on.
She doesn't have the talons yet.

474
00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.565
That probably comes
with the first kill.

475
00:26:53.449 --> 00:26:56.805
Besides. if we were able to save her
when she turned into a Wendigo...

476
00:26:56.969 --> 00:26:58.288
A Wendi-what?

477
00:26:59.009 --> 00:27:00.283
A Wendigo.

478
00:27:00.449 --> 00:27:04.567
It's kind of like a werewolf.
only meaner.

479
00:27:06.449 --> 00:27:08.599
Is this the spell that you used?

480
00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:13.838
Is there some sort of spell I could do.
you know. in advance

481
00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:16.284
so I could not become.
maybe. a banshee or...

482
00:27:16.489 --> 00:27:18.207
What word did you
sub "demon" with?

483
00:27:18.689 --> 00:27:19.838
"Dirtbag. "

484
00:27:21.569 --> 00:27:22.922
"Dirtbag. "

485
00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:31.407
Okay.

486
00:27:32.489 --> 00:27:33.922
Hand.

487
00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:38.208
Guided spirits. hear our plea

488
00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:42.288
Annul this magic. let it be

489
00:27:42.449 --> 00:27:43.928
Please let it be.

490
00:27:51.889 --> 00:27:53.527
Do you think it worked
a little too well?

491
00:27:57.329 --> 00:27:59.399
- Leave me...
- Shut up!

492
00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:34.720
I've been looking for you.

493
00:28:39.129 --> 00:28:41.643
- Damn it.
- Why isn't it working?

494
00:28:41.849 --> 00:28:43.487
Because Piper
isn't a witch anymore.

495
00:28:43.689 --> 00:28:45.486
Well. can't you just
scry for evil then?

496
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:49.847
Do you have any idea how much evil
is running around San Francisco?

497
00:28:51.449 --> 00:28:52.928
Damn it. Piper.

498
00:28:56.009 --> 00:28:58.045
Cole. Thank God.

499
00:28:58.249 --> 00:29:00.524
- Don't thank him yet.
- You didn't find her?

500
00:29:00.689 --> 00:29:03.283
I didn't get a chance to look.
Every time I used my sensing powers.

501
00:29:03.449 --> 00:29:07.237
a bounty hunter sensed me.
I fought off three of them.

502
00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:10.159
- I'm sorry.
- No. it's... It's okay.

503
00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:12.998
Somehow everything's
gonna be okay.

504
00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:18.118
I don't have even a little idea
how everything's gonna be okay.

505
00:29:18.329 --> 00:29:20.126
- Phoebe.
- You know why? Because nothing

506
00:29:20.289 --> 00:29:21.642
- is okay.
- Phoebe?

507
00:29:21.849 --> 00:29:24.283
My sister is a Fury.
my boyfriend is a demon...

508
00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:25.922
- Oh. baby. You're bleeding.
- Phoebe.

509
00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:31.246
Didn't you say you found me because
Piper cast a spell to find a lost witch?

510
00:29:31.409 --> 00:29:35.402
Yes. but I also said
that Piper's not a witch anymore.

511
00:29:35.609 --> 00:29:38.840
Yes. but if I could substitute
the word "dirtbag" for "demon."

512
00:29:39.009 --> 00:29:41.125
why can't we substitute
the word "sister" for "witch"?

513
00:29:41.369 --> 00:29:42.848
Would that work?

514
00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:46.968
Well. no. Not if she's
already looking for a kill.

515
00:29:47.129 --> 00:29:48.881
- The call won't be strong enough.
- Why not?

516
00:29:49.049 --> 00:29:50.402
Because of the pull of evil.

517
00:29:50.569 --> 00:29:52.799
When I was possessed
by the Woogie.

518
00:29:52.969 --> 00:29:54.800
- the blood lust was so strong.
- Woogie?

519
00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:57.887
- Don't ask.
- The point is...

520
00:29:58.049 --> 00:29:59.641
...I don't think she'll answer the call.

521
00:30:03.809 --> 00:30:05.606
Then we'll add bait.

522
00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:14.605
No. No. are you kidding me? No.

523
00:30:14.809 --> 00:30:16.527
The Furies go after evildoers. right?

524
00:30:17.969 --> 00:30:21.325
Paige. we are not using
the love of my life as bait.

525
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:23.884
Yes. we are. It's perfect.

526
00:30:25.169 --> 00:30:27.603
Cole. you have been a demon
for over a century.

527
00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:31.165
That is a lot of victims. The pain
of their cries alone can kill you.

528
00:30:31.369 --> 00:30:33.644
But as you said. I'm not the demon
who did those things anymore.

529
00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:36.846
And if facing my crimes
helps save your sister...

530
00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:38.687
- Cole. I...
- Phoebe...

531
00:30:44.249 --> 00:30:46.160
I would do almost anything
for you. you know that.

532
00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:50.566
But I will not be a coward for you.
Please don't ask me to be.

533
00:30:56.889 --> 00:30:58.686
We'll need some of your blood.

534
00:30:59.329 --> 00:31:00.603
Right.

535
00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:03.203
Knife.

536
00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:12.398
- Power of the sisters rise
- Power of the sisters rise

537
00:31:12.569 --> 00:31:15.129
- Course unseen across the skies
- Course unseen across the skies

538
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:17.484
- Come to us who call you near
- Come to us who call you near

539
00:31:17.649 --> 00:31:19.879
- Come to us and settle here
- Come to us and settle here

540
00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:22.483
- Blood to blood. I summon thee
- Blood to blood. I summon thee

541
00:31:22.649 --> 00:31:25.209
- Blood to blood. return to me
- Blood to blood. return to me

542
00:31:29.489 --> 00:31:32.162
I know where evil dwells.

543
00:31:37.649 --> 00:31:38.877
You sure about this?

544
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:41.722
I'm good at a lot of things.
Waiting is not one of them.

545
00:31:45.129 --> 00:31:46.448
Honey. what are you doing?

546
00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:48.008
I'm trying to do that orb thingy.

547
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:49.921
I can't seem to get
the hang of it. though.

548
00:31:54.729 --> 00:31:56.242
- What happened?
- You orbed.

549
00:31:56.609 --> 00:31:58.520
- I did?
- It's a fear response.

550
00:31:58.689 --> 00:32:01.078
So until you learn how to control it.
you just have to...

551
00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:03.245
- Get scared?
- Pretty much.

552
00:32:04.369 --> 00:32:05.927
All right.

553
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:08.364
- Well. that shouldn't be too difficult.
- Good.

554
00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:10.326
Then we will orb. we will levitate.

555
00:32:10.489 --> 00:32:11.968
we will juggle knives if we have to.

556
00:32:12.129 --> 00:32:13.881
just to keep the Furies
distracted from Cole.

557
00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:17.161
Okay. but what I don't get is how we
un-demon Piper once she gets here.

558
00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:20.039
Well. we have to close the portal
of unexpressed fury.

559
00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:22.723
Unexpressed? I think
she's been raging for days.

560
00:32:22.889 --> 00:32:24.800
That's because there's something
she's not saying.

561
00:32:24.969 --> 00:32:27.358
- Which is?
- I don't know.

562
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:28.882
But I think I have an idea.

563
00:32:34.729 --> 00:32:35.923
They're close.

564
00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:39.523
Paige.

565
00:32:41.329 --> 00:32:42.762
I did it again.

566
00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:45.124
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

567
00:32:55.129 --> 00:32:56.482
Phoebe.

568
00:32:58.329 --> 00:33:00.843
Nice decoy. Piper. Two points.

569
00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:09.202
Cole.

570
00:33:09.369 --> 00:33:10.882
Cole.

571
00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:12.801
Come on.

572
00:33:14.129 --> 00:33:15.608
Lamp.

573
00:33:18.929 --> 00:33:20.521
Sorry.

574
00:33:21.569 --> 00:33:23.161
Really sorry.

575
00:33:33.409 --> 00:33:35.525
Cole is not your problem. Piper.
and you know it.

576
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:44.203
Book.

577
00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:48.280
Please let there be
something in here.

578
00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:51.962
Cole. don't.

579
00:33:53.689 --> 00:33:54.917
You think I abandoned you.

580
00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:57.879
You think it's my fault
that Prue died.

581
00:33:58.049 --> 00:33:59.721
You blame me. So just admit it.

582
00:34:04.449 --> 00:34:06.679
You don't wanna kill me. Piper.
You don't even know me.

583
00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:08.363
You okay?

584
00:34:08.569 --> 00:34:09.797
It's not about me.
It's not about Phoebe.

585
00:34:10.009 --> 00:34:11.408
Leo.

586
00:34:18.009 --> 00:34:19.761
Phoebe's not the sister
who abandoned you.

587
00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.079
- It's Prue.
- Leo. do something.

588
00:34:27.729 --> 00:34:29.447
Where did he take them?

589
00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:32.203
To what Piper's really angry at.

590
00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.001
Tell her. Piper.
It's all right to hate her.

591
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:51.439
You should hate her.

592
00:34:51.609 --> 00:34:54.601
When my parents died.
I hated them for it.

593
00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:57.158
I was alone. and I hated them.

594
00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:00.405
It is okay to hate Prue.

595
00:35:05.849 --> 00:35:08.044
How dare you!

596
00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:10.884
How dare you leave me?

597
00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:14.446
How could you go and die
and leave me here all alone?

598
00:35:14.609 --> 00:35:17.203
Please come back.

599
00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:21.078
I need you. Please come back.

600
00:35:32.409 --> 00:35:34.639
It's okay. It's okay. honey.

601
00:35:34.809 --> 00:35:36.686
It's not okay.

602
00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:39.885
She risked her life every day.

603
00:35:40.049 --> 00:35:41.721
She never thought about
what would happen

604
00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:43.959
to me and Phoebe
if she was gone.

605
00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:45.318
I know.

606
00:35:45.489 --> 00:35:49.960
How could she think
that I could live without her?

607
00:36:18.169 --> 00:36:20.364
Did you sleep?

608
00:36:20.529 --> 00:36:23.760
Yeah. Actually.
better than I have in a while.

609
00:36:26.009 --> 00:36:27.283
It's quiet. isn't it?

610
00:36:28.049 --> 00:36:29.448
Early and late.

611
00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:32.764
It's just really. really quiet.

612
00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:36.164
Prue was always the first one up.

613
00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:38.559
and the last one down.

614
00:36:40.209 --> 00:36:42.404
It's strange.
the things that you miss.

615
00:36:45.569 --> 00:36:46.843
So...

616
00:36:47.009 --> 00:36:49.079
...how scary was I?

617
00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:52.885
Heck. I've seen worse.

618
00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:54.687
I've been worse.

619
00:36:55.369 --> 00:36:56.802
But...

620
00:36:57.369 --> 00:36:59.246
...about Paige.

621
00:36:59.449 --> 00:37:03.761
- She completely freaked.
- No. She handled it.

622
00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:05.807
Better than most people would.
I think.

623
00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:08.518
She saved your life.

624
00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:12.365
She definitely is a Halliwell.

625
00:37:12.529 --> 00:37:14.281
Last name or no.

626
00:37:16.249 --> 00:37:19.924
I know I haven't been
the most welcoming.

627
00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:22.807
I just...

628
00:37:23.649 --> 00:37:25.162
I miss Prue so much.

629
00:37:26.049 --> 00:37:29.086
It's hard to imagine opening up
to someone else.

630
00:37:29.489 --> 00:37:32.128
With everything that happens
in our lives.

631
00:37:32.289 --> 00:37:35.087
love just feels like an invitation
for more pain.

632
00:37:42.449 --> 00:37:44.201
So maybe...

633
00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:47.127
...maybe you don't start with love.

634
00:37:48.729 --> 00:37:51.038
Maybe you just start with "Thanks. "

635
00:37:58.449 --> 00:38:00.360
South Bay Social Services.

636
00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:20.037
Muffins.

637
00:38:20.209 --> 00:38:21.801
Thanks.

638
00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:23.880
Busywork. I'm best in the kitchen.

639
00:38:24.049 --> 00:38:27.405
Prue was the one
that liked to chase demons.

640
00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:35.081
Man. he's like a whole new Donnie.

641
00:38:35.249 --> 00:38:37.604
What did Leo say to him?

642
00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:45.166
I don't know.

643
00:38:46.129 --> 00:38:48.484
He's a miracle worker.
that husband of mine.

644
00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.720
So how are you?

645
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:58.683
I've had bad hours.

646
00:38:58.849 --> 00:39:02.285
and hours that aren't quite so bad.

647
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:06.077
I guess you know how it is.

648
00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:08.838
Yeah.

649
00:39:09.009 --> 00:39:11.887
When my parents died.
there were some days

650
00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.926
I didn't think I'd survive the sadness.

651
00:39:16.249 --> 00:39:19.286
It'll never be okay
that she's gone. Piper.

652
00:39:19.969 --> 00:39:21.322
But I promise it will get better.

653
00:39:25.809 --> 00:39:27.640
You know. Leo could fix that for you.

654
00:39:29.169 --> 00:39:31.808
It's my first war wound.
I think I'll wear it with pride.

655
00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:35.602
Unfortunately. in this family.
it will not be the last.

656
00:39:37.169 --> 00:39:39.763
Well. every family
has its pros and its cons.

657
00:39:39.929 --> 00:39:42.727
A couple of demon battles
in exchange for the power

658
00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:45.483
to clear up my friend's skin.
I'd say it's worth it.

659
00:39:45.649 --> 00:39:47.401
The power to what?

660
00:39:50.769 --> 00:39:52.088
He's cute. isn't he?

661
00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:54.166
You should've seen him yesterday.

662
00:39:56.209 --> 00:39:58.325
Okay. you saved my life.

663
00:39:58.489 --> 00:40:00.957
So I guess we're even on
the Book of Shadows swipe.

664
00:40:01.169 --> 00:40:04.923
But. Paige. there are rules
to being a witch.

665
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:08.480
Rules that you will have to
learn and follow.

666
00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:13.205
Well. not to be difficult.
but you're married to our whitelighter.

667
00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:16.566
and Phoebe's shacking up
with a demon.

668
00:40:16.729 --> 00:40:19.721
so on balance.
maybe my friend could stay cute?

669
00:40:21.249 --> 00:40:23.001
Okay.

670
00:40:24.009 --> 00:40:25.078
My. my. my.

671
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:29.163
That pile looks about the same size
as it did about an hour ago.

672
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:30.762
Oh. that was my fault.

673
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:33.159
I distracted her with muffins.

674
00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:34.887
And you are...?

675
00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:40.521
I'm her sister.
