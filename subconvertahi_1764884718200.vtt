00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.312
[Julie] Please.

177
00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:09.706
can you just tell me
where we're going?

178
00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:11.490
Where's Father Khatri?

179
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.408
They used to shriek.
Did you know that?

180
00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:20.847
All night long. they'd shriek.
Drove people crazy.

181
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.242
That all stopped
once we got the talismans.

182
00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:25.548
Then they started to whisper.

183
00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:27.854
I always wondered about that.

184
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:30.379
Your voices tell you
anything about that?

185
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:33.164
No.

186
00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:36.080
'Course not. God forbid
they tell you anything useful.

187
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:39.300
Keep walking.

188
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:42.086
Not until you
tell me what's going on.

189
00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.653
You think you're
gonna stand there

190
00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:45.263
and make demands
after what you did?

191
00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:46.525
Where is Father Khatri?

192
00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:48.563
He's dead!

193
00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:50.094
What?

194
00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:51.704
Those things got
into Colony House.

195
00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:55.273
Father Khatri tried to help.
Now he's dead.

196
00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:57.754
along with a lot
of other people.

197
00:09:57.884 --> 00:09:59.886
Is Ellis okay?

198
00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:05.675
He's fine.
He's scraped up.

199
00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:08.591
He's back at the clinic
with the others.

200
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.681
Oh. now you wanna cry.

201
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.597
You cry like that
for Bing Qian?

202
00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:16.816
[Sobbing]
You think I'm a monster.

203
00:10:16.947 --> 00:10:18.949
[Boyd] I don't give
two shits what you are.

204
00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:21.647
The only reason you're alive
is because Father Khatri

205
00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:23.301
thought you could
help us all get home.

206
00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:24.868
The second you prove him wrong.

207
00:10:24.998 --> 00:10:27.827
I'm gonna put
a bullet in you myself.

208
00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.916
Now. keep walking.

209
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.551
- Where are we going?
- I said keep walking!

210
00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:36.140
[Gun cocking]

211
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:46.061
So. I'll make up some beds
for you in the basement.

212
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.761
Uh. bathroom's in the back and
feel free to use the kitchen.

213
00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:50.807
but you've gotta
respect the rations.

214
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:52.812
It won't be the most
comfortable thing in the world.

215
00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.379
but we should have Colony House
back up

216
00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:55.812
and running pretty soon. so...

217
00:10:55.942 --> 00:10:58.031
What the fuck is this?

218
00:10:58.162 --> 00:11:00.730
Uh. we're gonna have a few more
house guests for a little while.

219
00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:04.538
And how little
is a little while?

220
00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:07.392
Aren't you the guy that thought
this was a giant escape room?

221
00:11:07.476 --> 00:11:09.260
How'd that work out for you?

222
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.653
- Fuck off.
- [Kenny] Okay.

223
00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:12.481
All right.
this is bullshit. okay?

224
00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:14.224
They chose the flower.
They don't belong here.

225
00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:15.440
Dude. why don't
you just...

226
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.705
All right.
any of you guys know Victor?

227
00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:19.749
All right. where's he squatting?
I need to find him.

228
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.707
I saw him running
towards the woods

229
00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:23.404
with the Matthews
girl last night.

230
00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:25.755
Fantastic.
See what a little inter community

231
00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.540
cooperation can do?
Kumbay-fucking-ya!

232
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.717
Let's get inside.

233
00:11:31.848 --> 00:11:33.937
That guy's
the fuckin' worst.

234
00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:37.070
I don't...
I don't even understand.

235
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:39.725
It was like one second everyone
was having such a good time...

236
00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:41.771
How... How did you
get out of the house?

237
00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:45.339
I was... I was up in
Victor's room and we...

238
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.559
No. It...
[Sighing]

239
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.782
- It wasn't like that. We were...
- [Tabitha] Julie...

240
00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.824
No. he was stacking
all of these.

241
00:11:51.955 --> 00:11:53.829
and it looked like he was
getting ready to leave.

242
00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.915
And then.
when the screaming started.

243
00:11:56.046 --> 00:11:58.483
we climbed out his window.

244
00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:00.354
and he said we had
to go to the forest.

245
00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:03.053
And then. we ran to this tree
and then he pushed me inside...

246
00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:04.881
- Hey.
- And I...

247
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:06.709
He said it was starting.

248
00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:08.652
What was starting?

249
00:12:08.737 --> 00:12:10.827
[Julie] I don't know. He...

250
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:15.892
All I know is. one second.
I was in a tree.

251
00:12:16.022 --> 00:12:18.764
and the next. I was in a
giant cabinet in a root cellar.

252
00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:19.939
How is that possible?

253
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.681
You went through a Farway Tree!

254
00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:24.814
Huh?

255
00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:28.034
Victor said you can
go all sorts of places.

256
00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:31.821
And sometimes people
go to different places.

257
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.910
So. maybe he went
somewhere else.

258
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.868
We have to find him!

259
00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:38.741
One step at a time.
Hey. Julie...

260
00:12:41.047 --> 00:12:42.701
Jules...
Hey. Jules.

261
00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:46.270
Julie...

262
00:12:47.924 --> 00:12:50.796
What's happening to us?
What...?

263
00:12:50.927 --> 00:12:52.755
- Honey...
- What is going on?

264
00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:53.885
What's happening?

265
00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:55.932
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

266
00:12:56.062 --> 00:12:58.412
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

267
00:12:58.543 --> 00:13:00.676
Hey. hey. No.

268
00:13:00.806 --> 00:13:01.851
[Crying]

269
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.679
Jules. we're gonna be fine.
Breathe.

270
00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:04.810
[Gasping]

271
00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:06.464
I know.
Everything's gonna be okay.

272
00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:08.205
- Yes.
- No! How can you say that?

273
00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:10.468
What part of this is okay?

274
00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.862
Honey. oh my God.
Just...

275
00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:15.865
Ah. Good. you're here.
Have you seen Victor?

276
00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.606
- [Tabitha] Hey!
- One of the squatters

277
00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:19.785
at my house said you ran off to
the woods with him last night!

278
00:13:19.869 --> 00:13:20.783
Ow! Ow!

279
00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:21.958
Hey!
I need to talk to her!

280
00:13:22.043 --> 00:13:24.376
What is wrong with you?!

281
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:26.963
Do you have any idea
what she has been through?

282
00:13:27.093 --> 00:13:28.968
Look. believe me. I get it.
Times are tough all around.

283
00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:31.315
But I found
something last night!

284
00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:35.798
There is this symbol that
I've been... I've been seeing.

285
00:13:35.928 --> 00:13:37.495
The same symbol is in this book.

286
00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:38.975
And last night. okay.
last night.

287
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:40.629
I found this photo!

288
00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:42.111
I don't give a shit
about your questions

289
00:13:42.195 --> 00:13:44.067
and your symbol and your books.

290
00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:46.460
Just stay the fuck away
from my daughter.

291
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:48.724
You understand me?

292
00:13:50.813 --> 00:13:54.991
Okay. you're doing the whole
protective dad thing.

293
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.862
I respect that.

294
00:13:56.993 --> 00:13:59.952
You dragged me out
into the woods.

295
00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:02.955
have me climb a fuckin' tree
for some stupid idea.

296
00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:04.957
and then you
run off like a psycho

297
00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:06.540
before we even have
a chance to try it.

298
00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:10.018
Yeah. uh.
I'm sorry about that...

299
00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:11.834
It worked.

300
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.055
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

301
00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:19.798
All I got was some static.
but it worked.

302
00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.847
I think if we get it
up over the tree line.

303
00:14:24.977 --> 00:14:26.109
and we get it enough power.

304
00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:27.893
I think we could
get a signal out.

305
00:14:28.024 --> 00:14:29.155
Wait. wait. wait.

306
00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:31.680
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

307
00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.727
We start by going
to the high ground.

308
00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:46.904

309
00:14:48.174 --> 00:14:50.394
Jesus. That's grim.

310
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:58.881
[Boyd] Where are
all the people?

311
00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:00.491
I mean...

312
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:03.015
Wait!

313
00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:05.061
- [Abby] Whoa. Boyd!
- [Boyd] Jesus!

314
00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:07.846
Hey!
Hey. hey. back up!

315
00:15:08.978 --> 00:15:10.153
Back up!

316
00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:12.677
You tryin' to get
yourself killed?

317
00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:14.331
I need you to
listen to me. please.

318
00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.463
Okay?
There isn't much time.

319
00:15:16.594 --> 00:15:20.163
Now. this is gonna
sound very. very strange.

320
00:15:20.293 --> 00:15:21.947
and you're not
gonna believe me.

321
00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:23.993
and I wouldn't
believe me either. Okay?

322
00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.763
And I wish there was
more time to explain.

323
00:15:25.864 --> 00:15:27.390
But if you don't come
with me right now.

324
00:15:27.474 --> 00:15:29.955
you're all going to die.

325
00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:32.436
- Oh...
- Okay. whoa. whoa. whoa. Mom.

326
00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:34.481
Mom. what the hell
are you doing?

327
00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:36.570
Okay. you have a gun.
That is good.

328
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:39.748
And you're welcome to keep it
pointed at me the entire time.

329
00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:43.664
But I am begging you.
please come with me.

330
00:15:43.795 --> 00:15:46.624
Go on.
Drive away. Drive away.

331
00:15:46.755 --> 00:15:48.234
No. no. no. no. Please.

[Screeching]

333
00:15:51.194 --> 00:15:54.110
What the hell was that?

334
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.155
That was death.

335
00:15:56.286 --> 00:15:58.767
and it's coming...
right now.

336
00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:03.075

[Screeching]

338
00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:15.479
[Boyd] Let's go.

339
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:29.841
You can put that thing away now.

340
00:16:29.972 --> 00:16:31.890
The only things that are
gonna hurt you are out there.

341
00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:34.153
and that thing's not gonna
make a damn bit of difference

342
00:16:34.237 --> 00:16:35.499
if they find us.

343
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:41.461
Look. I know you
all have questions.

344
00:16:42.288 --> 00:16:46.292
And. I promise. we will talk
when the sun comes up.

00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:04.528
- Okay.
- Ah...

350
00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:05.750
- Here we go. all right?
- Okay.

351
00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:07.052
- Nice and slow.
- Okay.

352
00:17:07.183 --> 00:17:08.274
It's gonna hurt a bit.
Just breathe.

353
00:17:08.358 --> 00:17:10.447
- Yeah.
- Good. good. good.

354
00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:11.187
- [Cracking]
- There we go.

355
00:17:11.317 --> 00:17:12.536
- [Grunts]
- Breathe.

356
00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.146
Good.
Breathe. breathe. breathe.

357
00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.124
Relax. Down. Good.

358
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:17.601
Okay. see?
Good as new.

359
00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:18.402
Yeah.

360
00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.109
- All right.
- Yeah.

361
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.766
[Kristi]
Just gonna put a sling on here.

362
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:22.981
Can I help with anything?

363
00:17:23.112 --> 00:17:25.679
[Kristi] Make sure
he doesn't get out of bed. Okay?

364
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.116
I don't want you going anywhere

365
00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.814
until I can give you
a solid once-over.

366
00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.210
- [Ellis] Yeah.
- [Kristi] All right?

367
00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:32.469
[Exhales]

368
00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:34.036
[Kristi]
Here we go. You good?

369
00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.689
[Sighing]

370
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.039
Be back in
a second. okay?

371
00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:39.041
Thank you.

372
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:41.434
[Kristi] Hey.

373
00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:43.262
Busy day for you.

374
00:17:43.393 --> 00:17:45.047
Uh. yeah. we're
a little short-handed.

375
00:17:45.177 --> 00:17:46.657
What can I do?

376
00:17:46.787 --> 00:17:48.093
Well. I could use some help

377
00:17:48.224 --> 00:17:49.664
getting this place
a bit more secure.

378
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.796
It's gonna be a full house
tonight. given what happened.

379
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.446
- So...
- Yeah. of course.

380
00:17:53.577 --> 00:17:55.796
Oh. I. um...

381
00:17:55.927 --> 00:17:59.191
I. uh...
I finished Chapter 6. It's...

382
00:17:59.322 --> 00:18:01.150
Things are starting
to get interesting.

383
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.151
Yeah. I don't think
it's gonna be

384
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:04.109
much of a reading
night tonight. but. uh.

385
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.719
yeah. I'll try to check it out.

386
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.025
[Kenny] Cool.

387
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.378
Thanks. Deputy.

388
00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:22.954
[Birds chirping]

389
00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:26.001
[Exhaling sharply]

390
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:27.393
Donna.

391
00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:31.528
[Sniffing]

392
00:18:31.658 --> 00:18:35.097
[Breathing heavily]

393
00:18:37.403 --> 00:18:40.232
You got a minute?

394
00:18:40.363 --> 00:18:42.495
How's Julie?

395
00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:45.063
She's okay.

396
00:18:45.194 --> 00:18:46.630
She's. uh...

397
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.154
But that...
That's not why I'm here.

398
00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:51.243
We came because
we need your help.

399
00:18:51.374 --> 00:18:52.288
With what?

400
00:18:52.418 --> 00:18:54.159
[Jim stammers]

401
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.422
We wanna build a tower

402
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.076
and we wanna
put it on the roof.

403
00:18:58.207 --> 00:18:59.207
What?

404
00:18:59.295 --> 00:19:00.647
We think if we can
get it high enough.

405
00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:03.908
we could
broadcast a signal

406
00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:06.171
that anyone else
in the area could hear.

407
00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:08.826
And what area
is that exactly?

408
00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:12.351
Look. whatever
this place is.

409
00:19:12.482 --> 00:19:16.268
wherever this place is.

410
00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:19.315
radio signals work
in ways that we can't.

411
00:19:19.445 --> 00:19:22.144
And we already got a strong
indication that this could work.

412
00:19:24.102 --> 00:19:26.322
Well... [Stammers]
We got a little static.

413
00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:29.281
C... Colony House

414
00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:32.284
is the highest point
on the highest hill.

415
00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:34.504
And if we build a tower
and we put it up there.

416
00:19:34.634 --> 00:19:36.941
we could broadcast out a signal
that could get up over

417
00:19:37.072 --> 00:19:40.684
any interference
from the forest canopy.

418
00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:45.471
Sure.

419
00:19:47.952 --> 00:19:49.998
You're okay with this?

420
00:19:50.128 --> 00:19:53.131
You know how many people
died here last night?

421
00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:56.004
Fourteen.

422
00:19:57.522 --> 00:19:59.843
Those things killed
14 of my people.

423
00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:03.932
There are pieces of them
lying all over this hill.

424
00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:08.146
And I don't think the others
are coming back any time soon.

425
00:20:11.454 --> 00:20:13.760
So. we might as well use
the house for something.

426
00:20:17.193 --> 00:20:18.847
[Boyd]
Keep going.

427
00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:23.761
Wait right there.

428
00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:34.738
Let's go.

429
00:20:43.355 --> 00:20:44.922
You're gonna sit tight here.

430
00:20:45.053 --> 00:20:47.620
I'll be back before dark.

431
00:20:47.751 --> 00:20:52.234
I've got a few things in town
to wrap up before we head out.

432
00:20:52.364 --> 00:20:53.583
Head out where?

433
00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:56.281
Find our way home.

434
00:20:56.412 --> 00:20:59.284
You won't need those.

435
00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:02.418
I'm not going anywhere.

436
00:21:02.548 --> 00:21:05.160
I wanna help.

437
00:21:06.147 --> 00:21:09.150
All I've ever
wanted to do is help.

438
00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:11.383
There's nothing to
chain you to here anyway.

439
00:21:11.514 --> 00:21:13.255
If you run...

440
00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:15.083
I understand.

441
00:21:19.522 --> 00:21:20.784
I'll be back.

442
00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.557

[Abby] Boyd.

446
00:22:08.614 --> 00:22:10.834
Here. Come on.

[♪]

448
00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:30.332
Welcome to your
worst nightmare.

449
00:22:30.462 --> 00:22:31.985
[Sighing]
Look.

450
00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:36.729
it's a...
It's a lot to unpack.

451
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.342
Just take it slow.

452
00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:42.365
I'll explain more
at the diner.

453
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:45.024
At the what?

454
00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:47.684
The diner.
It's. uh...

455
00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:49.923
Meet me over there.

456
00:22:54.138 --> 00:22:56.923
Hey.
You okay?

457
00:22:59.172 --> 00:23:01.958
No. not really.

458
00:23:02.268 --> 00:23:04.531
That's what you people
do every night here?

459
00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:08.544
Here?
You hide and pray?

460
00:23:08.674 --> 00:23:12.722
[Khatri] Well. there's really
not much else we can do.

461
00:23:12.852 --> 00:23:16.099
And you don't know
anything else about this place?

462
00:23:16.184 --> 00:23:18.142
Who built it?
How long's it been here?

463
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:23.211
Look. what we know
is what you see.

464
00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:26.112
And the people here.

465
00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:31.104
they just... they're just tryin'
to live through the night.

466
00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:34.222
Doesn't give us much time
for anything else.

467
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.487
You gotta start
working together.

468
00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.837
That's a little
easier said than done.

469
00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:42.099
[Boyd] Yeah. Right.

470
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.058
So. you start small. right?

471
00:23:45.189 --> 00:23:47.060
Gather your resources.

472
00:23:47.191 --> 00:23:50.412
create a system. making sure
everybody's covered at night.

473
00:23:50.542 --> 00:23:52.501
Nobody hides
in the same place twice.

474
00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.633
You gotta get
these people to start

475
00:23:54.764 --> 00:23:56.884
looking out for each other.
taking care of each other.

476
00:23:56.983 --> 00:24:00.291
and then. you build from there.

477
00:24:03.512 --> 00:24:04.512
Okay.

478
00:24:05.992 --> 00:24:09.257
But where do we start?

479
00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:13.173
[Exhales]
All right.

480
00:24:13.304 --> 00:24:15.380
Once we have
everything inventoried.

481
00:24:15.465 --> 00:24:17.815
we're gonna start
rationing it out.

482
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.618
Donna here is
in charge of resupply.

483
00:24:20.703 --> 00:24:22.922
So. you need anything.
you go see her.

484
00:24:23.053 --> 00:24:25.185
Abby is gonna be
drawing up a system

485
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.663
for where we spend
the nights.

486
00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:28.580
We're gonna start
digging up some new spots.

487
00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:30.756
make sure we are
constantly rotating.

488
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:32.932
Let's not make it easy
for these things.

489
00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:35.544
Come on.
What do you got?

490
00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.415
All right.

491

[Footsteps on stairs]

492
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:52.778
[Tabitha] Hey.

493
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.434
What are you doing?

494
00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:01.396
Are you hungry?

495
00:25:03.004 --> 00:25:05.224
[Julie]
No. Not really.

496
00:25:13.277 --> 00:25:15.453
Have you eaten anything?

497
00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:20.806
I don't know. No.

498
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.290
I'm gonna make you some food.

499
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:28.510
Are you and Dad still
getting a divorce?

500
00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:32.368
I. uh...

501
00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:35.706
I really don't have an answer
for you right now.

502
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:37.706
It's a simple question.

503
00:25:40.735 --> 00:25:42.694
It's not
that simple. honey.

504
00:25:48.712 --> 00:25:50.757
Hey. Hey.

505
00:25:52.882 --> 00:25:55.058
You said you loved each other.

506
00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.541
We do.

507
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.458
Then why?

508
00:26:03.588 --> 00:26:04.937
- Is it me?
- No.

509
00:26:05.068 --> 00:26:06.548
Did I do something wrong?

510
00:26:06.678 --> 00:26:08.724
Oh. God. no.
No. no. no. No.

511
00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:11.596
No. honey. you didn't
do anything wrong. Don't...

512
00:26:11.727 --> 00:26:13.163
No.

513
00:26:17.689 --> 00:26:19.082
Listen.

514
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.609
There are things that
you'll only understand

515
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.220
when you become a parent.

516
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:30.833
One of those things...

517
00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:33.096
is that you live
for your children.

518
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:41.496
Your only job is... is
to love them and protect them.

519
00:26:46.892 --> 00:26:49.504
So when Thomas died...

520
00:26:51.767 --> 00:26:53.595
something inside of me broke.

521
00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:00.906
And I have
no idea how to fix it.

522
00:27:07.783 --> 00:27:09.915
I keep reliving that day.

523
00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:14.157
It was just
such a normal day.

524
00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:18.995
You and Ethan were
in the next room.

525
00:27:19.563 --> 00:27:20.999
Your Dad and I
were in the kitchen.

526
00:27:21.084 --> 00:27:24.218
and Thomas was in his changing
table right between us.

527
00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:38.269
Then the phone rang.

528
00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:42.143
I reached for the diaper

529
00:27:42.273 --> 00:27:44.319
and your father reached
for the phone and...

530
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:51.500
we just turned for one second...

531
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.024
just one fucking second...

532
00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:57.158
and he rolled off the table.

[Sobbing]

534
00:28:05.514 --> 00:28:08.647
Your father
is the love of my life.

535
00:28:12.695 --> 00:28:14.914
But sometimes I see him and...

536
00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:21.530
I hear
that fucking phone ring.

537
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.316
Why didn't you tell me that?

538
00:28:25.447 --> 00:28:26.883
[Sighing]

539
00:28:28.972 --> 00:28:32.454
Because no matter
how grown up you are.

540
00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:35.196
you're always
gonna be my little girl.

541
00:28:39.156 --> 00:28:41.245
So we pretended...

542
00:28:44.553 --> 00:28:46.337
yeah. that everything was fine.

543
00:28:48.992 --> 00:28:51.212
I think that just made
everything worse.

544
00:28:55.477 --> 00:28:57.218
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:01.526
I'm sorry. too.

Tom. Eli.
what the hell are you doing?

556
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:26.638
We got people from Colony House
in our houses.

557
00:29:26.769 --> 00:29:28.379
using our supplies!

558
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.859
If I gotta choose between me

559
00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:31.864
and some asshole from
Colony House raiding this place.

560
00:29:31.948 --> 00:29:34.516
- then it's gonna be me!
- Nobody's raiding anything!

561
00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:36.173
Well. those things weren't
supposed to be able

562
00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:38.911
to get into Colony House either.
and look how that turned out!

563
00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:40.612
- Exactly.
- Alright. So then. you guys...

564
00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:42.524
You just wanna
throw it all away?

565
00:29:42.654 --> 00:29:44.534
Start acting like animals
and make it all worse?

566
00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:46.615
Look. we're gonna
figure this out.

567
00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:50.096
Just... just go home.

568
00:29:50.227 --> 00:29:52.969

Those things come out at night.

They walking around in
the forest during the daytime?

574
00:30:24.174 --> 00:30:27.090
Not as far as we can tell.

575
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.875
[Boyd] There might be
resources out there.

576
00:30:30.006 --> 00:30:32.225
We go scavenging
during the daytime.

577
00:30:32.356 --> 00:30:35.098
never know what
we might find.

Good luck findin' volunteers.

We'll work on that part.

in the military?

in the family.

Yeah. I'm fine. I...

592
00:31:23.974 --> 00:31:26.294
I was just thinking
about this dream I had

593
00:31:26.379 --> 00:31:28.076
when I was a little girl.

594
00:31:28.543 --> 00:31:30.371
I was...

595
00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:35.537
Never mind.
We should go help your dad.

596
00:31:35.622 --> 00:31:37.363
Lots to do.

597
00:31:43.806 --> 00:31:45.678
Can't go. not now.

598
00:31:45.763 --> 00:31:47.974
Damn near had
a riot at the diner.

599
00:31:48.255 --> 00:31:50.529
But this is exactly
why you said you had to go.

600
00:31:50.646 --> 00:31:52.381
Things are coming apart.
It's already starting to happen.

601
00:31:52.465 --> 00:31:54.240
We lost over a dozen people
last night.

602
00:31:54.325 --> 00:31:57.802
And we'll lose more if...
if they start to panic.

603
00:31:57.887 --> 00:31:59.541
- At least if you...
- Kenny. enough.

604
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.410
I'll stay until
things settle down.

605
00:32:01.495 --> 00:32:03.584
And what if they don't?

606
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.451
What if they don't?

607
00:32:05.637 --> 00:32:06.981
Am I interrupting?

608
00:32:07.317 --> 00:32:08.449
No. come on in.

609

610
00:32:09.714 --> 00:32:13.065
Kenny. we're done. Okay?

00:32:13.196 --> 00:32:15.130
We're not done.

613
00:32:16.986 --> 00:32:19.163
I said. we're not done.

614
00:32:20.918 --> 00:32:22.746
You told me you had to go.

615
00:32:23.392 --> 00:32:25.645
You told me
that I had to step up

616
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.560
and be strong
while you were gone.

617
00:32:27.733 --> 00:32:29.430
You told me we were
running out of time.

618
00:32:29.515 --> 00:32:31.953
and what part
of that's changed? Huh?

619
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:34.553
We've all been sitting
around the last few months.

620
00:32:34.637 --> 00:32:36.357
acting like those
talismans were a solution.

621
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:39.005
Like they made us safe?

622
00:32:39.227 --> 00:32:42.491
Well. guess what.
We were never safe.

623
00:32:42.777 --> 00:32:45.084
Those talismans were a Band-Aid.

624
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:47.606
a... a temporary reprieve.

625
00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:51.148
Things were never okay here.

626
00:32:51.332 --> 00:32:55.005
and things are never
going to be okay here.

627
00:32:57.495 --> 00:33:02.587
We need to find a way home

628
00:33:03.413 --> 00:33:05.521
or else every
single person here

629
00:33:05.606 --> 00:33:07.434
is gonna end up
exactly like Father Khatri.

630
00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:12.709
There are answers out there.

631
00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:15.728
and you're going to find them.

632
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:17.891
And in the meantime.

633
00:33:18.241 --> 00:33:20.765
you need to get over
what happened last night.

634
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.410
You need to get
your shit together

635
00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:24.427
and be the scary hard-ass
that you've always been

636
00:33:24.512 --> 00:33:27.428
because that's who people
need you to be right now.

637
00:33:27.849 --> 00:33:30.201
And if we're not gonna fight
like hell to go home.

638
00:33:30.768 --> 00:33:33.248
then we might as well swallow
a fucking bullet right now.

639
00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:37.841
Is that what you want?

640
00:33:51.208 --> 00:33:53.862
I didn't know the little
bastard had that in him.

641
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.263
Now. how about you explain

642
00:33:57.348 --> 00:33:59.480
what the fuck
he was talking about?

643
00:33:59.565 --> 00:34:01.436
Where exactly are you going?

644
00:34:02.017 --> 00:34:05.368
Let's take a walk.
I'll explain on the way.

a mile out. eating some grass.

652

out there too.

00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:24.740
Tomorrow.
I'm gonna set up some traps.

654
00:34:24.825 --> 00:34:26.100
There's chickens in the forest?

655
00:34:26.185 --> 00:34:27.230
Yep.

Hey. you know what?
Grab some people.

657
00:34:28.864 --> 00:34:31.380
We need to start rebuilding
that. uh. pen outside the barn.

658
00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:33.271
Okay? Hey! Hey!

I need to talk to you.

00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:41.591

take him off my hands?

Yeah. no. you got it.
Yeah. yeah.

He's not exactly what
I'd call cooperative.

667
00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:45.998
but just hold the rope.

668
00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:46.954
- Yeah.
- You got it.

669
00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:49.044
- I. uh...
- You believe that?

670
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:51.578
I knew I was gonna find
something out in those woods.

671
00:34:51.663 --> 00:34:53.780
I ain't think it was gonna be
livestock. but I'll take it.

672
00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:54.869
Who knows what else might be...

673
00:34:54.953 --> 00:34:56.389
You need to stop
going out there.

674
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.022
What?

675
00:34:58.107 --> 00:35:00.414
It's Mom.
She's not doing well. Okay?

676
00:35:00.535 --> 00:35:02.419
I mean. you've been going out
there for weeks now.

677
00:35:02.503 --> 00:35:03.780
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

678
00:35:03.864 --> 00:35:06.171
I think this place is. like.
starting to get to her.

679
00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.623
Okay.

680
00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:12.169
Look. I know you're scared. man.

681
00:35:12.254 --> 00:35:16.954
I'm fricking terrified.
But do me a favor. Look around.

682
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.513
The things we are doing
are working.

683
00:35:20.602 --> 00:35:23.039
There are things out
in those woods that can help us.

684
00:35:23.124 --> 00:35:26.780
things that might even...
All I know. all I know is that

685
00:35:27.073 --> 00:35:30.349
the second we stop looking for
answers. that's when we lose.

686
00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:32.135
Okay. so. then why don't
we just get someone else

687
00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:34.685
to go and look for a while?
Dad. we need you here.

688
00:35:35.023 --> 00:35:36.981
Mom needs you here!

689
00:35:37.974 --> 00:35:40.513
Okay. look. she... she's not...

690
00:35:41.012 --> 00:35:44.084
You know. sometimes.
I-I see her just standing.

691
00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:46.061
staring off in the middle
of the road. like she's...

692
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:49.505
Your mom... Your mom is
as tough as they come.

693
00:35:49.642 --> 00:35:51.774
Iron Abby. remember?

694
00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:55.677
Now. I know this is hard.
but this is what we have to do.

695
00:35:56.115 --> 00:35:56.935
at least for now.

696
00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.980
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying to you!

697
00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:02.807
Look. look. okay. okay.
Look. look. Look. look.

698
00:36:02.892 --> 00:36:05.764
We got about four hours
of daylight left. right?

699
00:36:05.849 --> 00:36:08.634
Help your mom get everybody
secured. tucked away.

700
00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:11.623
And when I get home
tonight. we will talk.

701
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:13.362
I promise.

702

want you to leave

883
00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:50.165
without saying goodbye.

884
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.904
This is not goodbye.

885
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.822
Okay? You hear me? Huh?

886
00:49:55.136 --> 00:49:57.225
This is not goodbye.

887
00:49:57.355 --> 00:49:58.226
Okay.

888
00:49:58.356 --> 00:49:59.923
All right.

889
00:50:05.189 --> 00:50:06.190
Hey.

890
00:50:08.402 --> 00:50:09.707
What is she doing here?

891
00:50:09.846 --> 00:50:12.370
[Stammers] Look. I need
to take her with me. Okay?

892
00:50:12.501 --> 00:50:14.035
Wait. no. you know
what she tried to do!

893
00:50:14.119 --> 00:50:15.941
No. no. no! Hey. look. look.
I need to take her with me

894
00:50:16.025 --> 00:50:18.137
'cause she might be helpful
for us to find out

895
00:50:18.222 --> 00:50:20.394
what we're looking
for out there. okay?

896
00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:23.238
I will explain everything
to you when I get back.

897
00:50:23.323 --> 00:50:24.933
We'll have a long conversation.

898
00:50:25.018 --> 00:50:26.948
hopefully on our way
outta this place.

899
00:50:27.033 --> 00:50:30.950
But for now. right now. I just
need you to trust me. okay?

900
00:50:31.035 --> 00:50:33.211
Okay. no one can
know she's with me.

901
00:50:33.578 --> 00:50:35.014
Can you do that for me?

902
00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:37.884
[Stammers] Can you trust me?

903
00:50:41.966 --> 00:50:43.707
Just come back.

904
00:50:44.009 --> 00:50:45.554
Yes. sir.

905
00:50:45.936 --> 00:50:47.501
All right.

906

Go on. Go.

907
00:50:51.194 --> 00:50:52.500
I love you.

I love you. too.

909
00:50:56.216 --> 00:50:58.436
[Chuckles]
Okay.

910
00:51:03.214 --> 00:51:04.912
Yeah.

911

[Grunting]

912
00:51:11.732 --> 00:51:13.729
Look. we're in a tight spot.

913
00:51:14.555 --> 00:51:16.905
No one's gonna
pretend otherwise.

914
00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:20.438
But Sheriff Boyd
is risking everything for us

915
00:51:20.523 --> 00:51:22.351
out there in the forest.

916
00:51:22.436 --> 00:51:24.143
The least we can do is...

917
00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:26.843
keep ourselves
together while he does.

918
00:51:27.576 --> 00:51:29.516
So that means that we're gonna
do things a little differently

919
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.775
going forwards.

920
00:51:31.203 --> 00:51:33.639
No more Colony House.
no more town.

921
00:51:33.999 --> 00:51:37.258
We're a community. so...

922
00:51:37.586 --> 00:51:40.502
we do this together.

923
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.542
All you Colony House folk.

924
00:51:42.627 --> 00:51:44.846
I don't want any of you
being shitty houseguests.

925
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:48.684
Now. we're gonna get
the house put back together.

926
00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:50.359
but first of all.

927
00:51:50.444 --> 00:51:53.341
Jim here has an idea about
a way we might be able to get

928
00:51:53.471 --> 00:51:55.386
a signal to folks
back in the world.

929
00:51:55.523 --> 00:51:58.062
So we can either
put our energy towards

930
00:51:58.147 --> 00:52:00.320
boarding up a bunch
of broken windows.

931
00:52:00.405 --> 00:52:02.937
or we can help build
something that gets us all

932
00:52:03.022 --> 00:52:05.134
out of this shithole.

933
00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:06.792
Jim?

[Townspeople muttering]

935
00:52:10.424 --> 00:52:14.276
Well. we're gonna need supplies.

936
00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:16.577
anything we can get
our hands on.

937
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:20.237
We're gonna need batteries.
anything with a charge.

938
00:52:20.368 --> 00:52:23.501
But most of all.
we're gonna need people.

939
00:52:23.632 --> 00:52:26.330
The sooner we get this built.

940
00:52:26.461 --> 00:52:28.332
the sooner we can all go home.
