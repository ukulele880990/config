2
00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:43.086
I was expecting the Piersons as well.

3
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.523
but they're not coming. Please.

4
00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:55.664
Oh! My goodness.
Of course. Here. take mine.

5
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:08.720
I appreciate that
both of you are here.

6
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.072
What happened?

7
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.378
The children were at the water
fountain during gym

8
00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:15.901
and Sally told Becky Pierson

9
00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:18.295
she should save some for the
fish.

10
00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:20.993
and Becky ignored her.

11
00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:24.258
and Sally hit the back of her head
and her face went into the spigot.

12
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.521
And then Becky went after her...

13
00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.566
Hair pulling. scratching.

14
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.484
She didn't need stitches in the end.
I understand?

15
00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:36.792
This girl. this Becky Pierson.

16
00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:38.489
Sally told me she's a bruiser.

17
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.795
She's heavy.

18
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.278
The children poke pencils
into her sides when she's sitting

19
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:46.280
because they think she can't
feel it.

20
00:01:46.323 --> 00:01:47.759
Sally doesn't do that. does she?

21
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.153
No.

22
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:54.157
But this bad behavior is new.

23
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.419
I know that you're expecting a
child.

24
00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:57.987
but she already has a little
brother.

25
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.296
I guess what I'm asking is. has
anything changed at home recently?

26
00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:11.392
My. um... My father passed away. Last week.

27
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.311
The week before... Two weeks
now.

28
00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:24.709
I feel terrible for bringing
that up for you.

29
00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:26.146
Well. it has not been easy.

30
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:34.676
Is this Grandpa Gene we're talking about?
Oh. that poor thing.

31
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.244
Sally didn't mention it?

32
00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:40.508
Why didn't you call
us or send a note?

33
00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:44.903
I don't think she missed a day.

34
00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:46.862
Did she go to the funeral?

35
00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:49.038
Why would we put her through
that?

36
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.083
I don't think children
belong in graveyards.

37
00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:55.784
No. of course not.

38
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.309
Now I realize why she was
asking all those questions

39
00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.224
about Medgar Evers' murder.

40
00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:02.225
She was?

41
00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:05.533
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.883
I have to use the ladies room
again.

43
00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:09.667
We can talk about this another
time.

44
00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:12.322
No. I'm not as upset as I look.
I can't help this.

45
00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:24.465
I am mortified.

46
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.467
It's not a good time.

47
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.948
No. and it really should be.
shouldn't it?

48
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:34.953
Sally does need more attention.
She's grieving.

49
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.829
There is a very special pain
to losing someone at that age.

50
00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.573
I don't know if you
can understand that.

51
00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:49.316
I can.

52
00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:01.893
Mrs. Draper. I was just talking to
your husband and this really can wait.

53
00:04:02.372 --> 00:04:03.678
Are you sure?

54
00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.900
Because I just want
to put it behind us.

55
00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:11.381
I really just want everything to be
okay when the baby comes.

56
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:15.080
It's going to be a beautiful
summer.

57
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:23.915
"Tipped a barman: 75
cents."

58
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:27.136
"Hat-check tip at bar: 50
cents."

59
00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:30.226
"Cab to restaurant: $1.12.
Tipped the cab driver: 38 cents."

60
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.837
"Dinner at Hausner's: $19.44."

61
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:38.669
It's better to have a bit of Don
Draper than no Don Draper at all.

62
00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:42.107
I'd like that in writing.

63
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.546
It seems strange that the two of
you went on the same overnight trip

64
00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.724
and you put in for $70 and
he put in for $82.

65
00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:52.553
If I were lying. wouldn't I
have made it a round number?

66
00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:54.772
Not that Don's lying.

67
00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:56.252
I signed his receipts. didn't I?

68
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.737
Which brings us to the undocumented
portion of my assessment.

69
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.481
The amount of pencils.
pens. pads. paper and postage

70
00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:11.311
that are currently being consumed
suit a company four times our size.

71
00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:20.363
It has also been brought to my
attention that a credenza has disappeared.

72
00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:24.324
a theft that I believe
necessitates a conspiracy.

73
00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:27.196
People forget that Karl Marx was
the greatest economist who ever lived.

74
00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.286
and whatever you think of his
solution. the problem he posed

75
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.941
was about the catastrophic
up-and-down of the marketplace.

76
00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:36.597
Tell the folks at Admiral that
Karl Marx says everything's okay.

77
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.861
Boom and bust. Bull and bear. "I need
a TV." "I have a TV."

78
00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:42.254
Damn it. Paul. someone
helped Ken cherry-pick

79
00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:44.909
all of Burt's successful accounts
and I've been left with the dogs.

80
00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:46.563
Admiral is not a dog.

81
00:05:46.607 --> 00:05:49.044
Sales are flat. It's all
over their memos.

82
00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:54.615
And now I have to look them in the eye
with nothing. Except maybe new creative.

83
00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:57.182
Stop it.

84
00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:59.881
Mmm. now you're interested.

85
00:05:59.924 --> 00:06:03.406
There are some areas of growth. and I
mean literally. areas.

86
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.804
Atlanta. Oakland. Chicago.
Detroit. Newark. DC.

87
00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:11.675
Great jazz cities.

88
00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.374
And I left out St.
Louis and Kansas City. also growing.

89
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:17.246
What does that mean?

90
00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.422
Great jazz musicians?

91
00:06:19.466 --> 00:06:23.818
Seriously. is it possible that these
Admirals are being bought by Negroes?

92
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:26.690
Lois caught her scarf putting
paper in the Xerox.

93
00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:28.953
Maybe when Joan leaves I can
finally get rid of her.

94
00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:30.825
Can you pretend like you're backing
the media department

95
00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:33.958
and tell me what this says to you?
Look at the cities.

96
00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:36.700
Is it possible that Negroes are
out-buying other people two-to-one?

97
00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:40.443
You could jump to that
conclusion. I suppose.

98
00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:44.229
Did you hear about
Lois? You got a winner there. Kinsey.

99
00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:45.405
Did you see it?

100
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:46.536
I did.

101
00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:49.974
So what's everybody doing
tonight?

102
00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:52.455
Baby. Married. Kinsey?

103
00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:56.546
Do you want to go to the Mets game?
Tickets and a watch.

104
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.156
Why. thank you. Birds Eye.

105
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.942
Does the watch say "Birds Eye"
on it?

106
00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:04.032
No. it says. "Hamilton
Electric."

107
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:06.861
What time is it? What time isn't it?

108
00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:10.952
Admiral is happy. We're happy.

109
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:13.084
They're not happy!

110
00:07:13.128 --> 00:07:17.219
"Morris. comma. in reference
to retooling the factory"

111
00:07:17.262 --> 00:07:19.308
"for London Fog children's
and young adults..."

112
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:25.532
I thought I'd bring you the minutes to
the meeting. since you had to run off.

113
00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:34.671
You're wasting paper.

114
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:37.457
I'd have to make 1.000 to
keep up with your department.

115
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.939
They waste paper because they
throw out bad ideas.

116
00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:45.552
They waste paper because
they use it to sop up spilled drinks.

117
00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:47.510
right after their mid-afternoon
naps.

118
00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.643
You came here because we do
this better than you.

119
00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:52.994
and part of that is letting our
creatives be unproductive until they are.

120
00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:56.214
Pennies make pounds and
pounds make profits.

121
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:59.653
I don't want to talk
to you this way.

122
00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.785
I've tried it before
and it never works.

123
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:05.485
You're not usually this
emotional.

124
00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:06.486
You want to make money?

125
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:11.229
Start getting your nails dirty

126
00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:14.755
with Bert Cooper and Harry
Crane.

127
00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:19.237
Clients love to pay for media
and creative needs pencils.

128
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:21.283
I suppose I hadn't necessarily
thought of it that way.

129
00:08:21.326 --> 00:08:23.807
And lay off of expense accounts.

130
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:27.158
Think of the men's morale.
not just your own.

131
00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:30.031
You've obviously seen Bridge
on the River Kwai.

132
00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:32.381
I've seen everything. You
have my ticket stubs.

133
00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:33.513
Hmm.

134
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.834
Your uncle Herman is on
the line. He won't leave a message.

135
00:08:50.878 --> 00:08:54.925
Uncle Herman? My goodness. is
Aunt Alice all right?

136
00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:56.753
Who is this?

137
00:08:56.797 --> 00:08:59.234
It's Peter. Dottie's boy.
You called me.

138
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.757
It's Duck. Duck Phillips.

139
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:03.281
Duck.

140
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:06.023
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.
I didn't want to set off any alarm bells.

141
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:07.764
My name is Herman. you know
that.

142
00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:11.681
Except that I actually have an
Uncle Herman and he's 91.

143
00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:15.903
That's a sick joke.
I apologize. It's been too long.

144
00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:17.905
I don't know if you heard.
but I'm at Grey now.

145
00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:20.385
What's that like?

146
00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.301
People walking around the halls
all the time. laughing their heads off?

147
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:26.740
We're going to have lunch. you
know.

148
00:09:26.783 --> 00:09:29.786
I don't know. Duck. It doesn't
sound like a good idea.

149
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.354
Campbell. this is beyond
"No hard feelings."

150
00:09:32.397 --> 00:09:35.096
I won't waste your time. Haven't I
always been on your side?

151
00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:39.753
When?

152
00:09:39.796 --> 00:09:41.015
I'll have my girl call your
girl.

153
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.494
I'll say it's Clorox.

154
00:09:51.373 --> 00:09:55.812
Hello? Anyone home?

155
00:09:58.206 --> 00:10:00.817
I'll get it. Hello?

156
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.080
Mr. Draper? Yes.

157
00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:07.432
This is Suzanne Farrell.
Sally's teacher.

158
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:09.391
I'm not interrupting dinner. am I?

159
00:10:10.392 --> 00:10:11.785
No.

160
00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.264
I just felt I should
call and apologize

161
00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:14.962
about our meeting this morning.

162
00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:17.225
Why?

163
00:10:21.403 --> 00:10:22.578
Well. I...

164
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:30.630
What I mean is. my father
died when I was eight

165
00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:36.505
and I might have overdone it.
relating to Sally in that way.

166
00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:40.204
I didn't mean to upset your
wife. and...

167
00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:44.208
I guess I can get a little caught
up in things and lose perspective.

168
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.217
I don't know why I'm calling.
I'm embarrassing myself.

169
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:54.262
No. you're fine.

170
00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:59.006
If there's anything I can do...

171
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:00.268
Don?

172
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.009
Betts!

173
00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:05.795
Thanks for the call.

174
00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:12.193
It's time to go.

175
00:11:12.236 --> 00:11:14.108
Okay. we're going.
Let me get my keys.

176
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.110
They're in your hand.

177
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.723
Francine took the kids. Who was that?

178
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.769
No one.

179
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.078
If you're parked in emergency.
you'll have to move soon.

180
00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:30.472
First. let's make sure it's
not a false alarm.

181
00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:31.691
This is my third time.

182
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:32.779
We sent you home before?

183
00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:33.997
No. third baby.

184
00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:41.701
Your job's done. The solarium's down
the hall to the right.

185
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.181
Hang in there. Betts.

186
00:11:58.239 --> 00:11:59.849
I came in early to
cover for a friend.

187
00:11:59.893 --> 00:12:02.069
so there's a chance I'll see
you the whole way through.

188
00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.857
Daddy!

189
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.033
You can scream and yell as much as
you want in this hallway.

190
00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:12.732
but we're about to pass the
nursery.

191
00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:13.733
Of course.

192
00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:22.437
Excuse me.

193
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.092
I know it's silly. but I seem to be
having trouble with this pen.

194
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:26.441
I believe it's empty.

195
00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:27.485
I gotta go.

196
00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:34.797
Are you planning
to give the baby the breast?

197
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.320
No.

198
00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:37.365
Last time you ate?

199
00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:44.502
Lunch. Toast. cottage
cheese. pineapple.

200
00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:48.071
Pineapple? What were you thinking?
Anything else. sweetheart?

201
00:12:49.856 --> 00:12:52.162
Life Savers.

202
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:53.947
Has your water broken?

203
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.865
My water never breaks.
When will Dr. Aldridge be here?

204
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.133
Joseph Waddell?

205
00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:09.658
I'm Dennis Hobart.

206
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.703
That's good to know.

207
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:15.055
I haven't seen anybody in an hour.
What's going on?

208
00:13:15.098 --> 00:13:16.273
Well. we've had a shift change.

209
00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:19.799
My wife. Pam. Pamela Hobart.

210
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:21.452
She's fine. The baby's breech.

211
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:23.063
We're calling in a specialist.

212
00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:24.760
What?

213
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.457
Didn't somebody get your
permission?

214
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.895
Damn it. what is with you people?
I don't know a damn thing!

215
00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:31.027
Please don't raise your voice.

216
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:33.987
Now. I apologize. but we
need your permission.

217
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.815
Do whatever you have to do.

218
00:13:35.858 --> 00:13:37.991
We'll update you religiously.
Promise.

219
00:13:47.914 --> 00:13:50.655
This is not how I pictured it.

220
00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:53.658
Where's all the backslapping?

221
00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:58.011
You know. I brought this because
I thought it'd be a party in here.

222
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.883
It's not. but I'll have one.

223
00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:01.971
Right now?

224
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:03.625
Whenever you want.

225
00:14:10.414 --> 00:14:13.374
I left work this morning. I've
been here all day.

226
00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:15.985
I am so bored.

227
00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:24.211
I even called in.
Like the prison can't run without me.

228
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:38.268
You done this before?

229
00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:41.010
Twice.

230
00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:44.361
And yet I never thought to
bring a bottle.

231
00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:47.582
Well. what are we supposed to
do?

232
00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:56.330
My daughter took forever.
I remember being pretty worked up.

233
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.290
And the nurse said. "Don't
forget."

234
00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:03.206
"Your wife's in the boat.
You're on the shore."

235
00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:08.081
The other one a boy?

236
00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:09.212
Yes.

237
00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:13.347
You throw the ball around?

238
00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:17.307
Not enough.

239
00:15:36.718 --> 00:15:38.720
All right. Mrs.
Draper.

240
00:15:38.763 --> 00:15:40.417
I'm going to need
you to get on the bed

241
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.463
so I can prepare you for
delivery.

242
00:15:42.506 --> 00:15:44.204
This part should be familiar.

243
00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:47.337
I'll shave you and then
give you a quick low enema.

244
00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:01.351
Well. the good news
is. time has stopped.

245
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.313
I'd like to have a gold watch
one day. but I can't. you know?

246
00:16:06.356 --> 00:16:08.184
You don't want to have
anything on you like that.

247
00:16:08.228 --> 00:16:11.622
Would they attack you?

248
00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:15.626
I knew it was just a matter of time
before you started with the questions.

249
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.196
I bet you have a nightmare where you
end up in Sing Sing. right? Everybody does.

250
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.025
I do.

251
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:24.026
So what's it like?

252
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.249
You're outnumbered. but
you got the power.

253
00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:32.730
Kind of like being a king.

254
00:16:32.774 --> 00:16:34.297
Except your subjects
want to kill you.

255
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:36.996
Maybe. but they don't.

256
00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:41.000
'cause they know I'm dangerous.
and I got a badge. which they respect.

257
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:42.349
How do they know you're
dangerous?

258
00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:48.659
Well. they're not all bad.
There's extremes.

259
00:16:48.703 --> 00:16:51.401
We've got death row and then
we've got the baseball team.

260
00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:53.577
In '29. they played the Yankees.

261
00:16:55.405 --> 00:16:56.972
Everybody in stripes.

262
00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:01.890
You're a funny one.

263
00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:09.419
I tell a lot of jokes at work.
You hear some doozies.

264
00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:14.642
I have to watch what I do
when I leave work.

265
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.557
be careful not to bring it home.

266
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.602
Especially with a kid. right?

267
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.913
Just yesterday I was in A block

268
00:17:24.956 --> 00:17:28.438
and I thought. "Every single
one of these animals".

269
00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:31.833
"their mother had them.
they were a baby."

270
00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:35.619
And I think. "There they are. on the
other side of the fence."

271
00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:40.668
And you know what? Every one of them
would blame their mom and dad.

272
00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:42.757
That's a bullshit excuse.

273
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.150
That's true. Don.

274
00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:53.550
Ow!

275
00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:57.163
You have little veins.
Breathe and think about the beauty parlor.

276
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.341
Ow!

277
00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:03.082
Do you need to call someone else in?

278
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:05.127
It's in.

279
00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:09.305
The medication will help with the
pain and put you in a twilight sleep.

280
00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:11.177
Where is Dr. Aldridge?

281
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.004
He's in the city.

282
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:16.225
He went to Mama Leone's for
his anniversary. Isn't that sweet?

283
00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:18.097
Is he drinking?

284
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.142
'Cause my Aunt Emma. her
doctor was drunk.

285
00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:21.926
and he ruined her bladder.

286
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.670
Dr. Mendelowitz. the obstetrician.
is on duty and will fill in.

287
00:18:26.714 --> 00:18:28.237
I don't want him. I don't know
him.

288
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:29.673
He's our top man.

289
00:18:29.717 --> 00:18:31.371
I want Dr. Aldridge.

290
00:18:31.414 --> 00:18:33.895
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

291
00:18:33.938 --> 00:18:36.550
I don't want another doctor.
I want my doctor.

292
00:18:36.593 --> 00:18:39.944
Sit back. You're at 5
centimeters.

293
00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:43.034
That's halfway from here to the
Hebrides and other mountain ranges.

294
00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:45.776
which we are currently
studying in chapter 12.

295
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.127
The doctor will be here and
there.

296
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:52.740
The Hebrides are islands.

297
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:43.399
Try it now.

298
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.752
Thank you. Sister.

299
00:19:51.102 --> 00:19:53.148
What do you make her for?
Sixteen?

300
00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:54.758
Pfft.

301
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:12.907
Pam was screaming at me in the
car.

302
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.432
I don't think that's unusual.

303
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:17.738
That's my girl in there.

304
00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:23.657
If something happens to her.

305
00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:27.878
I just don't know what I'd do.

306
00:20:27.922 --> 00:20:29.663
And then there'd be that baby.

307
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.447
How could I love that baby?

308
00:20:41.457 --> 00:20:44.634
Our worst fears lie in
anticipation.

309
00:20:46.332 --> 00:20:48.116
You're so sure about that?

310
00:20:51.598 --> 00:20:53.164
I want to go home. you bitch!

311
00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:55.166
Please relax!

312
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.693
Let go of me! Get your hands off me!
Where's Don?

313
00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:01.085
He's in the waiting room.

314
00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:02.261
No. she can't hear you.

315
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:06.221
The hell I can't. Where is he?

316
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.570
Where's Don?

317
00:21:07.614 --> 00:21:08.789
He's in the waiting room.

318
00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:10.486
Bullshit.

319
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.228
He's never where you
expect him to be.

320
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:17.450
Have you seen him? Have
you been with him?

321
00:21:17.493 --> 00:21:19.408
Seven centimeters. She's
starting transition.

322
00:21:19.452 --> 00:21:23.978
Someone call him. I don't
want to be here.

323
00:21:24.021 --> 00:21:26.197
Push the Demerol. 25
milligrams.

324
00:21:31.464 --> 00:21:35.990
I'm just a housewife. Why are
you doing this to me?

325
00:21:45.478 --> 00:21:49.830
Mr. Hobart? Congratulations.
You have a little baby boy.

326
00:21:51.788 --> 00:21:53.877
Oh. my God.

327
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:55.792
Your wife and your
baby are doing fine.

328
00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:57.664
Can I go in? Can I see her?

329
00:21:57.707 --> 00:22:00.275
Not right now. She lost a lot
of blood and had a transfusion.

330
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.060
What? Oh. please. I have to see
her.

331
00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:06.237
Please. she's in recovery.
resting.

332
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:09.719
But you can go to the nursery and look
in at your son. It's just down the hall.

333
00:22:09.763 --> 00:22:10.938
Thank you.

334
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.860
A baby boy.

335
00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:24.691
Congratulations.

336
00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:25.866
You're all right. Don.

337
00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:31.872
I'm sure yours is gonna be good. too.

338
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:38.792
You know what? I know it.

339
00:22:40.663 --> 00:22:41.664
Thanks. Dennis.

340
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.978
You're an honest guy.
Believe me. I'm an expert.

341
00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:55.025
Go see your baby.

342
00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:58.377
Why do they put up with us? You know.
we don't deserve it.

343
00:23:02.511 --> 00:23:06.950
This is a fresh start. I don't
know who's up there.

344
00:23:08.517 --> 00:23:12.695
so I'm saying this to you.
I'm gonna be better.

345
00:23:14.088 --> 00:23:15.872
I'm gonna be a better man.

346
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.921
Tell me you heard me.

347
00:23:25.882 --> 00:23:27.144
I heard you.

348
00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:43.726
Don't fight the urge to bear
down.

349
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:50.646
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

350
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.474
Either you can do it or we will.

351
00:23:52.518 --> 00:23:54.737
but it's going to come out someway.

352
00:24:32.732 --> 00:24:33.950
Daddy?

353
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.475
Who are you?

354
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:37.476
It's me.

355
00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:41.828
I don't know you.

356
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:44.526
It's me. Elizabeth.

357
00:24:50.184 --> 00:24:51.577
You do know me.

358
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.233
Okay. so it's me.

359
00:24:56.277 --> 00:24:57.278
What are you doing here?

360
00:24:58.322 --> 00:25:00.368
I had to go away.

361
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.412
Well. don't you miss me?

362
00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:04.851
Of course. Listen.

363
00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:09.116
Nobody knows I'm here. okay?

364
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:17.646
Am I dying?

365
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.390
Ask your mother. Tell her.
Ruthie.

366
00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:26.133
Elizabeth. shut your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

367
00:25:32.922 --> 00:25:36.622
I left my lunch pail on the
bus and I'm having a baby.

368
00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:41.061
You see what happens to
people who speak up?

369
00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:47.241
Be happy with what you have.

370
00:25:47.284 --> 00:25:50.157
You'll be okay. You're a house
cat.

371
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.073
You're very important and you
have little to do.

372
00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:37.726
She's beautiful.

373
00:26:38.727 --> 00:26:39.728
It's a boy.

374
00:26:43.906 --> 00:26:45.255
You look terrible.

375
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.657
How do you feel?

376
00:26:55.701 --> 00:26:57.093
I need to put my face on.

377
00:26:58.747 --> 00:27:00.531
You look beautiful. Betts.

378
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:05.319
Gene.

379
00:27:05.362 --> 00:27:06.363
What did you say?

380
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.064
His name is Eugene.

381
00:27:13.414 --> 00:27:15.416
We don't have to decide that
now.

382
00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:18.680
Gene.

383
00:27:32.738 --> 00:27:34.740
Did you get any sleep?

384
00:27:34.783 --> 00:27:37.568
No. and I don't expect to for
the next six months.

385
00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:45.489
I wasn't sure where to put it
all.

386
00:27:49.493 --> 00:27:52.714
Mr. Draper's office. Please
hold.

387
00:27:52.758 --> 00:27:55.064
It's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?

388
00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:02.985
Roger.

389
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:04.073
Dada.

390
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:06.554
Where are you?

391
00:28:06.597 --> 00:28:08.599
Down the hall.

392
00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:10.166
How's Betty?
She perform like a champ?

393
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:12.038
She did.

394
00:28:12.081 --> 00:28:14.475
I need his initials.

395
00:28:14.518 --> 00:28:16.695
Jane's gonna put them on the back
of her yacht or something for him.

396
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:18.479
No name yet.

397
00:28:18.522 --> 00:28:21.482
There's a lot of guys twiddling
their thumbs down in art.

398
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:22.788
Why were you in the art
department?

399
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:24.746
Lane was.

400
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.095
Apparently. we're all backed up.

401
00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:28.054
No one will move forward
without your approval.

402
00:28:28.097 --> 00:28:29.359
I missed half a day.

403
00:28:29.403 --> 00:28:30.796
Well. Betty had the baby. not
you.

404
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:33.059
I'll see what I can do.

405
00:28:33.102 --> 00:28:35.322
Good.

406
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.628
That guy's a tick. See you at
the traffic meeting.

407
00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:45.724
Can I get some coffee?

408
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.553
You know what it's
like in that office.

409
00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:50.641
No one ever buys me lunch.

410
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.776
I like the turtleneck.

411
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.864
Really?

412
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:02.262
Ah.

413
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.570
Come. Join us.

414
00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:08.007
What is she doing here?

415
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.660
Don't worry about it. I
know what I'm doing.

416
00:29:09.704 --> 00:29:11.097
No. you don't.

417
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.228
Have a nosh.

418
00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:16.755
Two months at Grey and you're
already having a nosh?

419
00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:26.503
I didn't know until I got here.

420
00:29:28.592 --> 00:29:32.901
Look. I woke up one day and
had a realization.

421
00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:36.252
You two have a secret
relationship.

422
00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:38.559
What? That's ridiculous.

423
00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:40.909
Come on. The way you
handled that Freddy Rumsen thing

424
00:29:40.953 --> 00:29:42.955
so that she could move up?

425
00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:46.436
I've been doing this a long time.
I know what I saw.

426
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.873
That's not what happened.

427
00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:50.049
You can be modest if you want
to.

428
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:53.269
but that kind of focused
ambition is rare in advertising.

429
00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:56.316
Thank you.

430
00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:59.232
I want to take you both
with me to the promised land.

431
00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:02.670
At Grey. an account man is
expected to have ideas.

432
00:30:02.713 --> 00:30:04.759
and creatives are expected
to be geniuses.

433
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:06.108
You'll be sitting on velvet
pillows.

434
00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:09.068
showered with riches. awards.

435
00:30:09.111 --> 00:30:12.462
We're not going anywhere.
Well. she can.

436
00:30:12.506 --> 00:30:14.029
Do we have to go together?

437
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:21.515
Pete. I know you have
ideas and you're a risk-taker.

438
00:30:21.558 --> 00:30:23.386
Sterling Cooper is never
going to reward that.

439
00:30:25.911 --> 00:30:29.653
Well. thank you. Anything else?

440
00:30:29.697 --> 00:30:33.048
Don't be a baby. You should be
taking meetings like this twice a week.

441
00:30:33.092 --> 00:30:36.399
If you want to woo me. you'll
have to buy me my own lunch.

442
00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:41.927
Maybe I should leave. too.

443
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.407
Why would you do that?

444
00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:48.324
You're so talented.
You should strike while the iron's hot.

445
00:30:48.368 --> 00:30:50.152
What does that mean?

446
00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:51.458
It means the sky's the limit.

447
00:30:51.501 --> 00:30:53.286
No mortgage. no family.

448
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:55.897
You're a freewheeling career
gal with great ideas.

449
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:57.029
Am I wrong?

450
00:30:59.161 --> 00:30:59.945
I don't know.

451
00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:02.469
This is your time. Peggy.

452
00:31:24.708 --> 00:31:26.319
Let me ask you something.
Hollis.

453
00:31:26.362 --> 00:31:29.061
What type of TV do you have?

454
00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:30.105
An RCA.

455
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:31.193
Really?

456
00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:35.981
Color? Why did you get it?

457
00:31:36.024 --> 00:31:37.808
To watch TV.

458
00:31:37.852 --> 00:31:40.289
But why an RCA specifically?

459
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.771
I didn't see any difference. I
guess.

460
00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:48.863
Sixteen. Good afternoon.
gentlemen.

461
00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:57.089
A lot of Negroes prefer Admiral.
I've done research.

462
00:31:57.132 --> 00:31:58.525
I have an RCA.

463
00:32:00.005 --> 00:32:02.485
So. do your friends buy
Admirals?

464
00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:04.531
I'm sorry. sir. I can't really
say.

465
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.497
Look. This is important

466
00:32:14.541 --> 00:32:17.892
and I'd really like to have an
honest conversation with you.

467
00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.459
I don't want to get into
trouble.

468
00:32:19.502 --> 00:32:21.896
It's just us. It's just Hollis
and...

469
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.941
Mr. Campbell.

470
00:32:25.856 --> 00:32:27.597
Do you think I'm a bigot?

471
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.514
I just want to know why you
bought your TV.

472
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.084
I don't know. I don't remember.

473
00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:39.522
It's your TV. It's a big
purchase.

474
00:32:39.566 --> 00:32:41.263
I don't even watch the damn
thing.

475
00:32:41.307 --> 00:32:43.222
Really? Why not?

476
00:32:43.265 --> 00:32:48.096
Why should I? We've got bigger
problems to worry about than TV. okay?

477
00:32:49.271 --> 00:32:51.970
You're thinking about this in
a very narrow way.

478
00:32:52.013 --> 00:32:55.147
The idea is that everyone is going
to have a house. a car. a television...

479
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.887
The American dream.

480
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:08.856
It's my job.

481
00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:10.510
Every job has its ups and downs.

482
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:17.038
You don't watch baseball? I
don't believe you.

483
00:33:52.813 --> 00:33:54.162
What are you doing out of bed?

484
00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:55.772
I smelled something.

485
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:57.948
What are you making?

486
00:33:57.992 --> 00:34:00.081
A snack. You want some?

487
00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:01.996
Uh-huh.

488
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.564
I didn't know you could cook.

489
00:34:04.607 --> 00:34:05.695
Mommy's much better at it.

490
00:34:10.135 --> 00:34:11.745
Are you looking for a chick?

491
00:34:11.788 --> 00:34:12.789
I am.

492
00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:20.754
Miss Farrell told us about that when
we went to the farm.

493
00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:24.018
But she says those eggs can
never become a chicken.

494
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.934
even though they come
out of a chicken.

495
00:34:26.977 --> 00:34:28.240
Why's that?

496
00:34:28.283 --> 00:34:31.721
Because they're from the store.

497
00:34:31.765 --> 00:34:35.551
And you know what else? If you
hold an egg up and it has veins in it.

498
00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:37.814
you can shake it. then eat it.

499
00:34:37.858 --> 00:34:39.555
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

500
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.296
It's called addling.

501
00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:49.261
Is the baby gonna live in
Grandpa Gene's room?

502
00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:57.660
It's not Grandpa Gene's room.
It's the baby's room.

503
00:35:00.533 --> 00:35:01.621
Oh.

504
00:35:03.753 --> 00:35:06.104
I thought it was gonna be a
girl.

505
00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:08.628
Well. I thought you
were gonna be a boy.

506
00:35:11.892 --> 00:35:13.676
Not all surprises are bad.

507
00:35:21.945 --> 00:35:23.425
Everything's gonna be fine.

508
00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:26.515
That's what Miss Farrell said.

509
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:28.735
Well. then I guess it must be
true.

510
00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:56.197
Burt Peterson's firing
was undignified.

511
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:58.808
Building security.
That's all I'll say.

512
00:35:58.852 --> 00:36:01.550
Confirm
a couple of rumors.

513
00:36:01.594 --> 00:36:03.596
Did he throw a desk chair
against a window

514
00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:05.293
only to have it bounce back
and knock him over?

515
00:36:06.468 --> 00:36:07.991
Not that I know of.

516
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:10.168
Did he make a number two in
a file cabinet?

517
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:14.868
Burt Peterson lived
hard and loved hard.

518
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:18.045
So. Harry here is an expert in
media.

519
00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:20.265
Television. The air. not the
sets.

520
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:23.572
Now. Admiral Television
sales are flat.

521
00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:25.183
We know that.

522
00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:26.445
But as we studied your indices.

523
00:36:26.488 --> 00:36:29.056
we realized that they're not
flat everywhere.

524
00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:33.452
In fact. among Negroes. sales
are actually growing.

525
00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:34.496
We know that. too.

526
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.455
You do?

527
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.462
No. of course you do.

528
00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:47.857
These are your numbers. but I think
we've discovered an interesting strategy.

529
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:51.687
This is Ebony.

530
00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:56.562
By Negroes. for Negroes.

531
00:36:56.605 --> 00:37:02.785
Jet. Space in these magazines costs
far less than what you currently spend.

532
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:09.314
Daily newspapers that go just to
this market for pennies on the dollar.

533
00:37:09.357 --> 00:37:10.358
And?

534
00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:19.193
Shift a portion of the media
budget

535
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.195
from lower-indexing white areas

536
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.284
to this market. where it
can do more good.

537
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:26.418
They already like it and we can make
them buy more by increasing the exposure.

538
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:29.072
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone

539
00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:33.120
would make you the same profit
as a 2% increase system-wide.

540
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:35.905
And ads on television geared to this
market and white markets

541
00:37:35.949 --> 00:37:37.559
will have double the effect.

542
00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:40.301
A negro ad and a white ad?

543
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:44.087
So. Campbell. you're making
twice the ads for us now.

544
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:47.787
No. do them together. Integrate it.

545
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.223
I don't think that's legal.

546
00:37:50.572 --> 00:37:52.008
Of course it's legal.

547
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:56.709
Look. this conversation is
not worth having.

548
00:37:56.752 --> 00:37:59.712
Who's to say that Negroes
aren't buying Admiral televisions

549
00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:02.280
because they think white
people want them?

550
00:38:08.547 --> 00:38:11.332
Miss Olson
is here to see you.

551
00:38:11.376 --> 00:38:12.420
Send her in.

552
00:38:15.902 --> 00:38:17.512
Oh. Sorry.

553
00:38:21.168 --> 00:38:24.606
I know he doesn't need
clothes. but don't return it.

554
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.566
I'm the youngest. I never
had anything new.

555
00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:29.045
You didn't have to do that.

556
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:30.612
I did.

557
00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:33.398
No one told me they were all
going in on it together.

558
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:38.141
I heard you were back at work.

559
00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:39.665
but now I wonder if that's true.

560
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:41.275
I invited you in.

561
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:46.106
I don't know if this
is the best time.

562
00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:47.586
I don't know. It's kind of
serious.

563
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:59.380
I've been thinking about my
situation here.

564
00:38:59.424 --> 00:39:01.991
and I'm so grateful to you
for all you've done.

565
00:39:03.558 --> 00:39:04.646
I just...

566
00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:09.695
Well. you know. I'm paid very
little.

567
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.480
My secretary doesn't respect me

568
00:39:12.524 --> 00:39:15.701
because I make $71 more a
week than she does.

569
00:39:15.744 --> 00:39:19.531
Maybe we need to get you a
cheaper secretary.

570
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:24.927
Paul Kinsey does the same work
that I do. and not as well sometimes.

571
00:39:24.971 --> 00:39:27.887
And I don't know if you read it in
the paper. but they passed a law

572
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:31.760
where women who do the same work
as men will get paid the same thing.

573
00:39:31.804 --> 00:39:32.979
Equal pay.

574
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:36.939
It's not a good time.

575
00:39:36.983 --> 00:39:39.289
It's not a good time for me.
Don.

576
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:41.074
Do you know how
expensive this city is?

577
00:39:41.117 --> 00:39:43.990
It's not gonna happen.
Peggy. not now.

578
00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:45.818
I'm fighting for
paperclips around here.

579
00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.790
Third time. It must be old hat.

580
00:40:16.718 --> 00:40:18.154
You're gonna be fine. Peggy.

581
00:40:18.198 --> 00:40:19.939
I look at you and I think.

582
00:40:22.507 --> 00:40:25.118
"I want what he has."

583
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:26.162
Really?

584
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:34.127
You have everything.
and so much of it.

585
00:40:38.827 --> 00:40:40.960
I suppose that's probably true.

586
00:40:51.579 --> 00:40:53.451
What do you want me to say?

587
00:40:58.499 --> 00:41:00.893
I don't think I could have
been any clearer.

588
00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:05.985
You see what's been going
on here the last six months?

589
00:41:18.563 --> 00:41:20.303
What if this is my time?

590
00:41:42.195 --> 00:41:43.196
Hey.

591
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:46.939
Where are you going?

592
00:41:46.982 --> 00:41:50.116
To the ladies room.
You want to join me?

593
00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:51.552
Did you tell Don about Duck?

594
00:41:51.596 --> 00:41:52.727
That's none of your business.

595
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:54.729
Sure. they hear you're
shopping around.

596
00:41:54.773 --> 00:41:56.731
they'll want you more. but me?

597
00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:59.647
I'm sharing my job with Kenny.
I'm already redundant.

598
00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:01.693
You have relationships with
your clients. That's leverage.

599
00:42:01.736 --> 00:42:03.042
Did you say something?

600
00:42:03.085 --> 00:42:04.826
It's my decision. Pete.

601
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.611
Your decisions affect me.

602
00:42:28.197 --> 00:42:30.243
If it isn't Martin Luther King.

603
00:42:30.286 --> 00:42:32.985
I should dropkick you off the
roof.

604
00:42:33.028 --> 00:42:38.381
Admiral Television has no interest in
becoming a colored television company.

605
00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:41.167
But they are.
It seems illogical to me

606
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:45.780
that they would reject an
opportunity to make more money.

607
00:42:45.824 --> 00:42:47.303
Then again. I'm in advertising.

608
00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:50.742
This is a sensitive issue.
Businesses hate that.

609
00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:52.787
Let me put it in account terms.

610
00:42:52.831 --> 00:42:55.485
Are you aware of the number of
hand jobs I'm gonna have to give?

611
00:42:55.529 --> 00:42:57.575
Am I being
taken off the account?

612
00:42:57.618 --> 00:42:59.620
I'm going to have to pretend
I had you killed!

613
00:42:59.664 --> 00:43:01.622
Sales are flat.
I had to do something.

614
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:03.624
I don't know if anyone's
ever told you that half the time

615
00:43:03.668 --> 00:43:06.627
this business comes down
to. "I don't like that guy."

616
00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:10.718
Are we done with the flogging?

617
00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:16.158
Never as good as you
think it's gonna be.

618
00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:20.815
If I may. Bert. Roger.

619
00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:24.993
it does seem as though there's
money to be made in the negro market.

620
00:43:25.037 --> 00:43:27.343
Obviously not with Admiral.

621
00:43:27.387 --> 00:43:31.521
but I don't think it would be
wrong of us to pursue it in some way.

622
00:43:31.565 --> 00:43:34.002
Really?

623
00:43:34.046 --> 00:43:39.660
I've just moved here. I'm a
stranger in a strange land.

624
00:43:39.704 --> 00:43:42.924
but I can tell you there's
definitely something going on.

625
00:43:44.665 --> 00:43:48.016
We'll look into it. You can go.

626
00:44:40.242 --> 00:44:41.722
We're here! SALLY: She's here!

627
00:44:41.766 --> 00:44:43.811
- Mommy! Daddy!
- Mommy! Mommy!

628
00:44:43.855 --> 00:44:45.160
Welcome. welcome!

629
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:48.381
Mommy!

630
00:44:48.424 --> 00:44:50.600
Careful. Here. let me take him.

631
00:44:55.954 --> 00:44:57.477
I missed you so much.

632
00:44:59.653 --> 00:45:02.308
Wait till you see your fridge.

633
00:45:02.351 --> 00:45:06.181
If there's a power outage. you can
feed the entire street for a month.

634
00:45:08.967 --> 00:45:11.796
Hi. baby. I'm your brother.
Bobby.

635
00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:13.145
Remember. you have to be
careful.

636
00:45:14.146 --> 00:45:16.452
How was it?

637
00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:20.543
You know. It was all a fog.

638
00:45:22.023 --> 00:45:25.418
You're making a mistake not
forcing Carla to stay.

639
00:45:25.461 --> 00:45:28.813
She's been away from her family.
And I can manage.

640
00:45:28.856 --> 00:45:31.380
I know some girls.

641
00:45:31.424 --> 00:45:32.468
You want something to eat?

642
00:45:32.991 --> 00:45:34.079
Sure.

643
00:45:34.122 --> 00:45:36.124
I got it. Come on.
