2
00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.457
Bullshit.

3
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.667
It is this friggin' wide.

4
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.169
And it's periodic.

5
00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.546
Bull. Shit.

6
00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.631
Show me.

7
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.014
Something terrestrial. gotta be.

8
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.266
Bouncing off the moon.

9
00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.685
Gee. I never thought to check that.

10
00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.021
Look at that slope. man.

11
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.940
You could ski down that thing.

12
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.316
It is drifting.

13
00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.152
Look here. Zoom in. Zoom in.

14
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.570
See that variation?

15
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.407
And look. This gap here?
This is where it stops. then starts over.

16
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.035
-It repeats?
-Every 78 seconds.

17
00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.494
The whole entire thing.

18
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.831
Three hours straight. and no end in sight.

19
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:08.169
It can't be.

20
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.726
It's gotta be something
bouncing off the... off the...

21
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.895
It's not bouncing off the moon. Dave.

22
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.065
Well. maybe it's those Chatty Cathys
at the Forest Service.

23
00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.360
I hate those guys. Always on their radios.
talking about trees.

24
00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:33.446
Dave. it's not Smokey Bear
we're picking up.

25
00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.613
Look at that signal.

26
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.198
It's drifting.

27
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.492
What is it. then?

28
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.210
Looks like simple pulse-width modulation.
Old-school. like Morse code.

29
00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:53.090
Maybe somehow.
it's the time signal out of Fort Collins.

30
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.926
-They use pulse-width modulation.
-It's not the atomic clock.

31
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.429
The atomic clock changes every minute
because it's a clock.

32
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.348
This is the same exact data
repeated every 78 seconds.

33
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:06.645
Plus. this is coming
from 600 light-years away.

34
00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:12.150
This Morse code of yours
seems to be split four ways.

35
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.323
The pulses are of equal duration.

36
00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:20.159
but they're positioned
across four different frequencies.

37
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:23.579
-Looks like a player piano.
-So not binary but base four.

38
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:24.997
Quaternary.

39
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:28.333
This won't be easy to crack.

40
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.718
No. no. If you look at this. Look at...

41
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.347
What do you think it says?

42
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.017
Maybe just.
"Hello. Hey. hey. We're out here."

43
00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.687
What did we put on Voyagers 1 and 2?
Chuck Berry?

44
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.899
Maybe this is just
their version of "Johnny B. Goode."

45
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.069
Imagine the power it took to send it.

46
00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.489
Megawatts?

47
00:03:58.572 --> 00:03:59.823
Gigawatts?

48
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.743
And that's if it's pointed only at us.

49
00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.370
Antenna the size of Africa.

50
00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:05.621
-Mm-hmm.
-Bigger.

51
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.167
You go to all that trouble
to send a message.

52
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.878
it's gotta be more than just "hello."

53
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.839
And why make it hard to understand?

54
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.466
Quaternary?

55
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.553
That's like encryption.
Why would you bother to...

56
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.105
It's not quaternary.

57
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.987
I think I know what it is.

58
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.866
<i>The twin moons hung low and full.</i>

59
00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.702
Two wine-green eyes
peering over the horizon

60
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.204
as if to steal a glimpse
into Lucasia's soul.

61
00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.041
She paced the blood-soaked decks
of the <i>Mercator.</i>

62
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:36.003
looking for something. anything.
that might take her mind off Raban.

63
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:40.841
Ascending the forecastle. her gaze
lingered over a bare-chested young sailor.

64
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.219
On hands and knees he scrubbed.

65
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:47.723
his sinewy forearms stretched taut as he
washed away all trace of the day's fight.

66
00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:50.059
With a languid nod...

67
00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:54.479
...Lucasia bade him follow to her cabin.

68
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.275
Little did this callow deckhand know
that serving at his captain's pleasure

69
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.111
might take on such sweet meaning.

70
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.366
Or. regrettably.
that it would last but a single night.

71
00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:12.706
Later. at four bells.
Lucasia stood by the mizzenmast.

72
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.959
Once again. she was alone.

73
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.712
She pulled her topcoat tighter.

74
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.841
fingering its coarse wool
as her thoughts flashed back to Raban.

75
00:06:21.924 --> 00:06:25.177
It had been he who first wrapped
the coat around her.

76
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.054
whispering in her ear.

77
00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:31.517
"May this keep you warm
in my absence. <i>ma chérie</i>."

78
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:37.064
With that. Raban. proud. haughty Raban.

79
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.192
mounted the plank and leaped from sight.

80
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:43.278
The am a ran thine
slips and closed over him.

81
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.906
leaving nary a ripple.

82
00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.741
Aw...

83
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:02.131
Attention. lovers of
speculative historical romance literature.

84
00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:05.843
best-selling author Carol Sturka
will now sign her new novel.

85
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:07.428
<i>"Bloodsong of Wycaro."</i>

86
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:09.680
the fourth book in her
"<i>Winds of Wycaro"</i> trilogy.

87
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.641
"Why-car-oh." please!
It's "Winds of Why-car-oh!"

88
00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:15.978
And <i>Bloodsong</i> is the best yet.

89
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.730
God. are you in for a treat.

90
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.691
Let's go sign books!

91
00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.821
{\an8}Raban is alive. right?

92
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.573
{\an8}Maureen. You could read it.

93
00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.200
{\an8}Well. I will. Tonight.

94
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.327
{\an8}I've already unplugged the phone.

95
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.037
{\an8}Just. uh...

96
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.539
{\an8}-Raban's not on the cover.
-No. he's not.

97
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.042
{\an8}And he... he's never not been
on the cover. Carol.

98
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.295
{\an8}If Raban doesn't come back...

99
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.422
{\an8}...I'm done.

100
00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:45.174
Come here.

101
00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:48.051
Page 218.

102
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:53.682
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay. Bye.

103
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.850
Thanks. Maureen.

104
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.603
-Okay. this is Olga.
-Hi. Hi. Olga.

105
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.066
Hi. Yvette!

106
00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:05.319
Hi!

107
00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:06.987
Love it.

108
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.075
-Happy reading.
-This is Nicky. with a pillow.

109
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:13.202
{\an8}-Nicky with a... Oh. my gosh!
-I made it myself.

110
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.037
{\an8}-Look at that. You made this?
-Yes.

111
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.122
This is Christine.

112
00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.290
This is Paulina and support person.

113
00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.458
-This is Carlotta.
-Hi.

114
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.168
Say. "Raban".

115
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.920
Raban.

116
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.339
When Raban and Eldgammel
fell in the cargo hold.

117
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.299
do you remember what it was loaded with?

118
00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:28.592
Mandovian spice fruit.

119
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.761
Which Lucasia is...

120
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.721
Deathly allergic to!

121
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.265
{\an8}-Oh. you guys run a fan club?
-Of course!

122
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.396
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you.

123
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.480
-Hi. Tanya.
-Hi!

124
00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.690
-Are you excited?
-Yes.

125
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:43.983
-Hi. Yvonne.
-Hi.

126
00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:45.901
I got two books. one for the tub.

127
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.946
This is a authentic cutlass
just like Raban's.

128
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.698
-Okay.
-Careful. it's really sharp.

129
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:52.283
Okay. so three things.

130
00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:55.578
When finally are they
gonna make a "<i>Wycaro"</i> movie?

131
00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:58.581
And please tell me it'll be in actual
theaters. not on the Lifetime Network.

132
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:00.916
You gotta get ILM to do the slips and.

133
00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.461
otherwise it's just gonna look like <i>merde.</i>
pardon my French.

134
00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:07.131
A small but very crucial point.

135
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:11.969
as a two-masted schooner. the <i>Mercator</i>
would not possess a mizzenmast. So...

136
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.805
Craig. I'm gonna need you
to put this back in the bag

137
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.473
before the store manager sees it.

138
00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.350
-Oh.
-Right.

139
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:19.852
-Your humble servant.
-Thank you.

140
00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.564
Oh. that's the one.

141
00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.023
Thank you so much.

142
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:27.610
-We'll see you at the next one.
-Happy reading.

143
00:09:27.693 --> 00:09:29.570
All right. All right.

144
00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:37.161
Hi. ladies. I have us
going to the Hyatt Regency Dallas.

145
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:39.580
Hi. Yeah. Thanks. uh. perfect.

146
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:43.834
That was quite a send-off.
I'm sorry. should I know who you are?

147
00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:47.171
Uh. depends.
You a big fan of mindless crap?

148
00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:22.248
Morning. Doc.

149
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:24.458
Well. it certainly is.

150
00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:27.127
-Hey. Mel.
-Hey.

151
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.254
Ooh. where'd those come from?

152
00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:30.839
Yours truly.

153
00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:33.592
Help yourself.
I think they're mostly glazed.

154
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.679
but one box ought to be sprinkled.
powdered and all that.

155
00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:38.472
What did we do to deserve this?

156
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.934
Ah. my 14-year-old's selling 'em
for marching band.

157
00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:44.520
{\an8}Well. aren't you a good dad.

158
00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:47.231
{\an8}-What does she play?
-Trombone.

159
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.484
{\an8}-Doctor D!
-Good evening.

160
00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.278
{\an8}Morning. Whatever.

161
00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:54.572
{\an8}-Look what Mel brought.
-Ooh. for us?

162
00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:55.823
{\an8}Yeah. please.

163
00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:57.616
They got you two working late.

164
00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.118
Yeah. I gotta gas a bunch of rats.

165
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.829
So. how goes the big project?

166
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:04.540
What have you heard?

167
00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:07.125
I don't know. Things.

168
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:09.086
Well...

169
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.338
Our team's fairly certain
we've got a sequence

170
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.923
that encodes for a lysogenic virus.

171
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.842
But after eight whole months
of animal testing...

172
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:16.761
Macaques. rabbits. mice...

173
00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:19.471
-Guinea pigs.
-Guinea pigs. Now rats.

174
00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:22.057
No clinical signs whatsoever.

175
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.769
Put another way...

176
00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.604
we got bubkes.

177
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.523
We got bubkes.

178
00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.748
Okay. how do you wanna do this?

179
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:50.586
Uh. I can put 'em to sleep
if you wanna do the cardiac sticks.

180
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.589
I hate the cardiac sticks.

181
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.924
Well. you're more than welcome
to gas them.

182
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.927
I hate gassing them.

183
00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.804
Might be in the wrong career.

184
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:02.389
All right. cardiac sticks it is.

185
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.725
Let's get it over with.

186
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.811
Uh-oh.

187
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:10.606
Check it out.

188
00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:12.399
Oh. damn.

189
00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.235
What do you figure happened there?

190
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:22.367
I don't know.

191
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.600
He's looking pretty dead to me.

192
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.020
You got a heartbeat?

193
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.022
I can't feel jack shit in these gloves.

194
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:01.490
Huh.

195
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:02.783
Huh. what?

196
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.494
He's absolutely got a heartbeat.

197
00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.621
A strong one. Just bam. bam. bam.

198
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.373
It's weird.
If I didn't know any better. I'd...

199
00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.917
God. Oh. shit. Oh. no.

200
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.710
You've got to be kidding me.

201
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.922
-Shit.
-Did he break the skin?

202
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.216
Um. Yeah. I don't...
Yeah. it's through the glove.

203
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.052
Oh. shit. Uh. soak it quick.

204
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.137
Keep it submerged.

205
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.598
If it's bleeding.
make sure to squeeze it out good.

206
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:28.642
I'm gonna call this in
as soon as I catch him. okay?

207
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.531
Uh-huh.

208
00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:46.743
Right there.

209
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.960
Let's mark 3:36 and. uh...

210
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.090
Jenn?

211
00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.886
Talk to me. Jenn. Jenn!

212
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.929
Jenn! Jenn! Jenn!

213
00:14:06.972 --> 00:14:08.307
We are getting out right now.

214
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:12.060
I got you. Okay. come on.

215
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:13.979
I got you.

216
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.028
Hang on.

217
00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.782
Jenn. can you hear me? It's gonna be fine.

218
00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:25.866
You're gonna be all right.

219
00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.205
Come on. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right. you hear me?

220
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:34.166
Come on. come on. come on.
Talk to me. Come on. Jenn. come on.

221
00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.210
Jenn! You all right?

222
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:38.462
Jenn?

223
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.047
Just say something.

224
00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:42.341
Jenn. I got you.

225
00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:43.509
I got you.

226
00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:45.219
Jenn?

227
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.348
Hey. hey. hey. hey. Jenn. Can you hear me?

228
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:51.767
Jenn. say something.

229
00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:03.612
Damn it.

230
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.280
Kidding me?

231
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.461
Really?

232
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.012
Damn.

233
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.561
Can you believe this thing?

234
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.521
You've got skinny arms.

235
00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.440
Do you think you could maybe. uh...

236
00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:40.816
Uh.

237
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:43.694
Hey.

238
00:16:25.903 --> 00:16:26.904
Yes?

239
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:28.627
I'm gonna get some gum.

240
00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.754
Whoa. Seriously?

241
00:20:11.837 --> 00:20:15.299
I had one Tito's in Salt Lake.
That was. like. two hours ago.

242
00:20:39.156 --> 00:20:40.282
<i>Rye Manhattan...</i>

243
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:43.994
and a Diet Pepsi.

244
00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.162
Thanks.

245
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.750
We could take a cab home.

246
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.670
Don't tell me you don't need a drink.
'cause you need a drink.

247
00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:54.964
-I don't need a drink.
-You need a drink.

248
00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:56.173
I don't need a drink.

249
00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.966
I call bullshit on that.

250
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.093
I need sleep. that's what I need.

251
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:02.971
Hey. cheers. to the best tour yet.

252
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.767
-You gonna leave me hanging here?
-I do not clink glasses

253
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.436
with fucking Diet Pepsi.

254
00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.063
Best book tour? What is that?

255
00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:12.773
Is that like best stomach cancer?

256
00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:14.817
You endure it. you do not toast it.

257
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.863
Oh. how I hate all those paying customers
showering me with love and respect.

258
00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:21.698
And why do I have to make
so much money?

259
00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.492
How do you bear it?

260
00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:33.836
Bunch of dummies.

261
00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:38.006
Wow. It's a ship that sails on... on sand?

262
00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:41.218
Purple sand?
That is. uh... That's brilliant.

263
00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.469
The world needed that.

264
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.139
And the world needed
yet another female character

265
00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:49.518
who spends all her time mooning over
some fucking proud and haughty pirate.

266
00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.312
-He's a corsair. not a pirate.
-Mmm.

267
00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:55.065
"Mandovian spice fruit."

268
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:57.860
Jesus. That... I...

269
00:21:57.943 --> 00:21:59.862
It's like a bad episode of <i>Star Trek</i>.

270
00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:01.614
So how about
you throw everybody a change up?

271
00:22:01.697 --> 00:22:03.949
Hmm? Green sand instead of purple?

272
00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:06.994
Maybe it's time for your serious book.

273
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:11.915
Why not? You've been plugging away
at it for five years.

274
00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:14.502
-Four and a half. Barely.
-Oh. Pardon me.

275
00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:15.669
So put it out already.

276
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:17.045
I can't just... It...

277
00:22:18.547 --> 00:22:19.756
It needs polishing.

278
00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:22.676
Obviously. I mean it does. right?

279
00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.970
Okay. take the next few months and polish.

280
00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:26.055
I'll work it out.

281
00:22:26.138 --> 00:22:28.432
I'll buy you some more time
before your next <i>Wycaro</i>.

282
00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.853
You really think
<i>Bitter Chrysalis</i> is that good?

283
00:22:35.147 --> 00:22:36.773
I think people will love it.

284
00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:44.740
You ever read. um. <i>Finnegans Wake</i>?

285
00:22:44.823 --> 00:22:45.908
No.

286
00:22:46.617 --> 00:22:48.911
I tried to. In grad school.

287
00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:54.166
It's probably great. I don't know.

288
00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:58.712
All I know is it made me miserable
trying to get through it.

289
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:02.966
I figure...

290
00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:07.095
you make even one person happy.
maybe that's not art.

291
00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:10.557
But it's something.

292
00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:19.400
To Raban.

293
00:23:19.483 --> 00:23:21.985
Proud. haughty Raban.

294
00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.245
Did you bring your cigarettes?

295
00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:33.288
Since when do you smoke?

296
00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.165
Since now.

297
00:23:56.186 --> 00:23:59.147
Are you trying to start a forest fire?
Stop wasting my butane.

298
00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:02.234
Stop telling me how to smoke.

299
00:24:02.818 --> 00:24:03.861
I used to smoke in middle school.

300
00:24:03.944 --> 00:24:06.322
You're supposed to light the other
person's cigarette first. by the way.

301
00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:07.907
-That's etiquette.
-Yeah? On a plane.

302
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.075
do you put your own oxygen mask on first?

303
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:14.663
Ooh.

304
00:24:14.746 --> 00:24:17.624
Do you wanna hear what HoustonMom78
says about <i>Bloodsong</i>?

305
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.377
"Best <i>Wycaro</i> ever!" All caps.

306
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.505
And. uh...

307
00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:26.425
-...16. 17 exclamation points.
-Oh. wow.

308
00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:27.760
-Is that a new record?
-It's gotta be.

309
00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:31.347
"Spoiler alert. Raban is back
and yummier that ever."

310
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.516
Yummier than ever. I think she means.

311
00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:35.643
"Mmm. mmm. you better belief

312
00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:37.812
he's got my permission to come aboard.

313
00:24:37.895 --> 00:24:39.313
I'd walk his plank any time."

314
00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:40.815
I'm sensing a nautical motif.

315
00:24:40.898 --> 00:24:43.150
A little bit. Think Houston Mom's
off her meds again?

316
00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:45.778
I think HoustonMom would spread her legs
for a grilled cheese sandwich.

317
00:24:48.739 --> 00:24:49.740
Huh.

318
00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:52.492
Look at that.

319
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.079
What?

320
00:24:55.162 --> 00:24:56.872
What do you think they're doing?

321
00:24:57.664 --> 00:25:00.792
-What's what doing?
-The planes. Uh. up. Look.

322
00:25:03.378 --> 00:25:05.548
I don't know. What. is that weird?

323
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:07.049
Yeah. it's weird. Isn't it?

324
00:25:07.132 --> 00:25:09.593
All of them kinda parallel like that.

325
00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:11.595
Huh.

326
00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:24.316
Anybody else weigh in?

327
00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.861
It's all the usual suspects.
plus a few new ones.

328
00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:29.488
Everybody loves it.

329
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.668
You wanna answer a few questions for them?

330
00:25:43.794 --> 00:25:45.546
-What. now? No. No. no.
-Ah. do one quick one.

331
00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:47.506
Let 'em know you're paying attention.

332
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:51.343
"Carol. my husband says
Raban can be my hall pass".

333
00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:54.180
which I don't think is fair
since Raban's not a real-life person.

334
00:25:54.263 --> 00:25:55.723
although I wish he was.

335
00:25:55.806 --> 00:25:59.643
In real-life. was there an actual man
you were thinking of

336
00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:01.437
"when you came up with Raban?"

337
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.272
That's hilarious.

338
00:26:05.274 --> 00:26:08.034
You wanna tell her the truth?

339
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:11.363
What do you have to lose?

340
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:15.200
Put down George Clooney.

341
00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:16.994
-What?
-Nothing.

342
00:26:17.077 --> 00:26:18.788
-What's wrong with him?
-Nothing. Just...

343
00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:20.998
I mean. how about
a hot Brazilian soccer player?

344
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:22.749
Someone with dreadlocks. Hip it up.

345
00:26:24.084 --> 00:26:25.586
Just...

346
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.296
...put George Clooney.

347
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.131
It's safer.

348
00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:35.721
Shit.

349
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.681
Oh.

350
00:26:50.444 --> 00:26:51.445
Oh.

351

Buddy. you... You okay. buddy?

352
00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:06.919
Oh. Jesus.

353
00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:19.640
Helen. should we call someone?

354
00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:23.352
Helen?

355
00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:25.187
Helen. stop looking at the goddamn ph...

356
00:27:37.908 --> 00:27:38.909
Helen?

357
00:27:43.038 --> 00:27:44.289
Oh. my God. Helen!

358
00:27:45.082 --> 00:27:46.458
Helen?

359
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.085
Helen?

360
00:27:49.878 --> 00:27:51.004
Uh.

361
00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:52.715

368
00:28:17.948 --> 00:28:19.283
Oh. God.

Come on. please.

370
00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:26.225
Please. please.

-<i>You've reached the Albuquerque Police...</i>
-Yes. Hi. I...

00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:30.938

373
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:32.481
-<i>Please remain on the line.</i>
-Fuck!

374
00:29:32.564 --> 00:29:34.775
-<i>An operator will be with you shortly.</i>
-Fuck!

375
00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:37.486
<i>You've reached the Albuquerque Police...</i>

376
00:30:20.904 --> 00:30:24.283
Come on. come on. come on. come on.

377
00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:26.327
Come on. come on. Come on.

00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:29.246
Come on. come on. come on!

379
00:30:33.458 --> 00:30:35.127
Fuck you.

380
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:38.339
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

381
00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:43.677
Fuck you!

382
00:30:52.227 --> 00:30:55.898
Hey. you gotta get out.
Come on. get out. Get out! Oh. God.

383
00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:01.445
No! Fuck!

384
00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:05.449
Fucking go!

385
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:33.537
Oh. thank God.

386
00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:37.458
Oh. thank God.

387
00:33:57.538 --> 00:33:59.206
Hey. Hey.

388
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:02.209
Wake up.

389
00:34:03.752 --> 00:34:04.837
D... Uh. D...

390
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.257
Dr. Nguyen. I-I need you to wake up.

391
00:34:09.257 --> 00:34:10.718
Please wake up.

392
00:34:10.801 --> 00:34:11.885
Doctor.

393
00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.637
Dr. Nguyen. wake up.

394
00:34:14.221 --> 00:34:15.222
Wake up.

395
00:34:15.806 --> 00:34:16.849
Please wake up.

396
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.560
Dr. Nguyen. wake up!

397
00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:24.231
Okay.

398
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:29.235
Oh. sh...

399
00:34:54.678 --> 00:34:56.388
Oh! I'm so sorry! Fuck.

400
00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:02.186
Okay.

401
00:35:20.746 --> 00:35:22.456
Okay. Here we go.

402
00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:26.752
Helen?

403
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:29.004
Helen? Helen?

404
00:35:32.007 --> 00:35:33.759
Helen. Helen.

405
00:35:38.013 --> 00:35:39.014
Hi.

406
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.433
Baby.

407
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.608
Hi. baby.

408
00:35:56.198 --> 00:35:57.366
No. no. no. no. no.

409
00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:26.479
Goddamn it.

410
00:36:26.562 --> 00:36:27.646
Okay.

411
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.235
Come on.

412
00:36:36.697 --> 00:36:39.116
Somebody please help me.

413
00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:41.827
No. no. no. God. no. Don't...

414
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.413
Please. Please.

415
00:38:17.047 --> 00:38:18.048
Hey.

416
00:38:21.176 --> 00:38:22.261
Hey.

417
00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:32.771
What... What is happening?

418
00:38:49.288 --> 00:38:50.915
Hey! Hey! Don't you touch her!

419
00:38:50.998 --> 00:38:53.334
You put her down. Put her down.

420
00:38:53.417 --> 00:38:55.294
Get out! Go away!

421
00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:02.301
What the hell is wrong with you people?

422
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.345
We just wanna help. Carol.

423
00:40:14.748 --> 00:40:17.125
What the fuck?

424
00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:30.426
Oh. Christ. no.

425
00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:49.487
Come on. come on. come on.

426
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.446
Come on. come on. please.

427
00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:07.838
There's a spare key.

428
00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:11.508
We can show you.

429
00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:15.012
No. No. stop. Don't... Don't...
Don't... Don't come any closer.

430
00:43:15.095 --> 00:43:17.014
We don't mean to scare you. Carol.

431
00:43:17.097 --> 00:43:18.474
You're in no danger.

432
00:43:18.557 --> 00:43:20.434
We really do want to help.

433
00:43:20.934 --> 00:43:23.395
Remember? April 2016.

434
00:43:23.478 --> 00:43:25.355
The last time you got locked out.

435
00:43:26.023 --> 00:43:28.025
You put a spare key under the flower pot.

436
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:30.235
The one on the right.

437
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:32.070
Back there.

438
00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:39.870
There you go.

439
00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:48.170
Shoo. Leave me alone.

440
00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:50.714
-Please.
-Sure. Carol.

441
00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:53.258
Just give us a couple of minutes
to clear out.

442
00:44:31.213 --> 00:44:33.257
We're very sorry for your loss.

443
00:47:03.657 --> 00:47:04.825
Oh. fuck yeah!

444
00:47:04.908 --> 00:47:07.203
God bless America.

445
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.513
<i>Hi. Carol. Thank you for calling.</i>

446
00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:55.143
Yep.

447
00:48:55.644 --> 00:48:57.855
<i>This must be so bewildering for you.</i>

448
00:48:57.938 --> 00:48:59.023
<i>So terrible.</i>

449
00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:01.775
<i>All the death and destruction
you witnessed tonight.</i>

450
00:49:02.401 --> 00:49:06.489
<i>Especially Helen's passing.
Please know none of that was intentional.</i>

451
00:49:06.572 --> 00:49:08.824
<i>You have our deepest condolences.</i>

452
00:49:09.324 --> 00:49:11.702
<i>And to say it again. you are in no danger.</i>

453
00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:13.620
<i>You are perfectly safe.</i>

454
00:49:14.663 --> 00:49:16.707
-Okay.
-<i>Your life is your own.</i>

455
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:18.834
<i>Please know that.</i>

456
00:49:18.917 --> 00:49:21.712
<i>Your well-being
is of utmost importance to us.</i>

457
00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:23.338
O-Okay.

458
00:49:24.214 --> 00:49:25.466
<i>Completely up to you. of course.</i>

459
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:28.719
{\an8}<i>but you might want to stick close to home
for the next few days.</i>

460
00:49:28.802 --> 00:49:32.681
{\an8}<i>We've a lot to clean up.
and it may be distressing for you to see.</i>

461
00:49:32.764 --> 00:49:35.518
<i>But we will put things right.</i>

462
00:49:35.601 --> 00:49:39.396
<i>To that end. if we may be of assistance
with Helen's remains...</i>

463
00:49:39.479 --> 00:49:40.939
-Nope.
-<i>Okay.</i>

464
00:49:41.607 --> 00:49:43.901
<i>If we can help you in any way
please let us know.</i>

465
00:49:43.984 --> 00:49:48.322
<i>We can deliver food. medicine.
whatever you need.</i>

466
00:49:48.405 --> 00:49:50.324
<i>Just dial zero. day or night.</i>

467
00:49:50.407 --> 00:49:54.745
<i>You will want to call from a landline
as all the cellular networks are down.</i>

468
00:49:54.828 --> 00:49:56.872
<i>But we are here for you.</i>

469
00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:03.962
{\an8}<i>We feel like we're doing
all the talking here.</i>

470
00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:07.508
{\an8}<i>Are there any questions
you might have for us. Carol?</i>

471
00:50:07.591 --> 00:50:08.800
{\an8}<i>Anything at all.</i>

472
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.138
Uh...

473
00:50:14.306 --> 00:50:16.475
Yeah. Yeah. sure.

474
00:50:17.893 --> 00:50:19.520
I guess to start with.

475
00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:23.732
what the fuck is happening?

476
00:50:23.815 --> 00:50:25.192
<i>Well. basically...</i>

477
00:50:25.275 --> 00:50:26.694
It's an alien invasion. right?

478
00:50:26.777 --> 00:50:28.612
I mean. obviously it's an alien invasion.

479
00:50:28.695 --> 00:50:30.072
<i>Actually. no. It is not.</i>

480
00:50:30.155 --> 00:50:32.950
What the fuck it isn't. You know my name.

481
00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:35.494
You know Helen's name.

482
00:50:35.577 --> 00:50:39.248
You... You are talking to me from my TV!

483
00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:43.085
And what the fuck is with everybody's...

484
00:50:43.168 --> 00:50:44.462
Shit like this...

485
00:50:44.545 --> 00:50:48.215
And those two weird... th-the weird...
the weird neighbor kids next door.

486
00:50:48.298 --> 00:50:51.260
They know where some
goddamn key... Ho-How...

487
00:50:51.343 --> 00:50:53.596
How would they know that. huh?

488
00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:57.099
{\an8}-Are you reading my mind?
-<i>No. Absolutely not.</i>

489
00:50:57.182 --> 00:50:58.851
{\an8}<i>We couldn't do that if we wanted to.</i>

490
00:50:58.934 --> 00:51:01.479
{\an8}Who is "we?"
Why is everybody suddenly "we?"

491
00:51:01.562 --> 00:51:04.440
{\an8}<i>You know. we could continue this
after you've had a good night's sleep.</i>

492
00:51:04.523 --> 00:51:06.609
Who is "we?"

493
00:51:06.692 --> 00:51:08.903
<i>"We" is us. Just us.</i>

494
00:51:08.986 --> 00:51:09.987
Who the fuck is "us?"

495
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.948
<i>Us. There are no aliens.</i>

496
00:51:13.615 --> 00:51:14.992
<i>Not on this planet.</i>

497
00:51:15.075 --> 00:51:19.580
<i>We are. however. beneficiaries
of extraterrestrial technology.</i>

498
00:51:20.414 --> 00:51:23.209
<i>Fourteen months ago.
astronomers discovered a radio signal</i>

499
00:51:23.292 --> 00:51:25.669
<i>from 600 light-years away.</i>

500
00:51:26.253 --> 00:51:27.797
<i>There's no telling
how long it's been repeating.</i>

501
00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.591
<i>Maybe throughout all of human existence.</i>

502
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.220
<i>This signal. it's made up of four tones</i>

503
00:51:34.303 --> 00:51:39.349
<i>representing guanine. uracil.
adenine and cytosine.</i>

504
00:51:40.058 --> 00:51:43.437
<i>It's a recipe. it turns out.
for a nucleotide sequence.</i>

505
00:51:44.021 --> 00:51:45.147
<i>RNA.</i>

506
00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:48.776
<i>Scientists have created
this sequence in a lab.</i>

507
00:51:48.859 --> 00:51:53.781
{\an8}<i>It is not a living thing. per se.
It is more akin to a virus.</i>

508
00:51:53.864 --> 00:51:55.824
{\an8}<i>Though it's not that exactly either.</i>

509
00:51:56.909 --> 00:52:01.246
{\an8}<i>It's kind of a psychic glue
capable of binding us all together.</i>

510
00:52:03.165 --> 00:52:04.166
Okay.

511
00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:06.877
So. if you're not aliens...

512
00:52:08.837 --> 00:52:10.517
Who am I talking to right now?
Who are you?

513
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.175
{\an8}<i>This particular individual?</i>

514
00:52:13.258 --> 00:52:14.885
{\an8}<i>This is Davis Taffler.</i>

515
00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:19.389
{\an8}<i>Under Secretary of Agriculture
for Farm Production and Conservation.</i>

516
00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:23.853
{\an8}<i>But you are currently
talking to every person on Earth.</i>

517
00:52:23.936 --> 00:52:25.771
{\an8}<i>including Davis Taffler.</i>

518
00:52:26.396 --> 00:52:27.397
<i>We're all one.</i>

519
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:29.274
How does that work?

520
00:52:30.025 --> 00:52:32.653
{\an8}<i>We don't know exactly. It just does.</i>

521
00:52:33.195 --> 00:52:35.865
Can I talk to the President?

522
00:52:35.948 --> 00:52:38.951
<i>That individual passed away this evening.
unfortunately.</i>

523
00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:43.247
<i>Along with quite a few senior members
of the United States government.</i>

524
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:48.252
{\an8}<i>Davis Taffler happened to be
nearby and intact.</i>

525
00:52:48.335 --> 00:52:49.879
{\an8}<i>And he was wearing a suit. So...</i>

526
00:52:49.962 --> 00:52:52.548
{\an8}So... So. you're in charge now?

527
00:52:52.631 --> 00:52:54.383
-Y... The Under Secretary of...
-<i>No.</i>

528
00:52:54.466 --> 00:52:57.511
{\an8}<i>Nobody's in charge.
Or everybody's in charge.</i>

529
00:52:58.095 --> 00:52:59.805
{\an8}<i>Really. there's no such thing anymore.</i>

530
00:52:59.888 --> 00:53:02.808
{\an8}But-B... There's got to be others like me.

531
00:53:02.891 --> 00:53:05.227
<i>Your situation is a rare one.</i>

532
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:08.564
<i>There appear to be
11 other individuals like yourself.</i>

533
00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:10.024
In Albuquerque?

534
00:53:10.107 --> 00:53:12.317
<i>No. In the world.</i>

535
00:53:12.818 --> 00:53:14.236
<i>We have reached out to them.</i>

536
00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:17.948
<i>Like you. they are disoriented.
Understandably.</i>

537
00:53:19.825 --> 00:53:21.285
<i>Rest assured. Carol.</i>

538
00:53:21.368 --> 00:53:24.162
<i>We will figure out
what makes you different.</i>

539
00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:26.123
Figure it out why?

540
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.041
<i>So we can fix it.</i>

541
00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:30.669
<i>So you can join us.</i>

542
00:53:31.587 --> 00:53:34.089
Oh. God.

543
00:53:37.718 --> 00:53:40.304
<i>Carol. you still there?</i>

544
00:53:42.556 --> 00:53:43.557
You...

545
00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:46.393
You said my life was my own.

546
00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:49.354
<i>It is. One hundred percent.</i>

547
00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:53.275
So. what happens when I say no?

548
00:53:54.568 --> 00:54:00.032
<i>Carol. once you understand
how wonderful this is...</i>

549
00:54:01.742 --> 00:54:02.743
<i>Carol?</i>

550
00:54:20.219 --> 00:54:24.515
<i>Hi! You've reached 505-796-6933.</i>

551
00:54:24.598 --> 00:54:27.226
<i>We're on the French Riviera
drinking champagne.</i>

552
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:29.854
<i>We are not here in our sweatpants
screening your call.</i>

553
00:54:29.937 --> 00:54:32.231
<i>Make it a good one.</i>

554
00:54:32.314 --> 00:54:34.024
<i>Carol. hello?</i>

555
00:54:34.775 --> 00:54:36.985
<i>It's us. Hello?</i>

556
00:54:38.362 --> 00:54:40.406
<i>We're sorry we upset you. Carol.</i>

557
00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:42.074
<i>We only want to make you happy.</i>

558
00:54:42.157 --> 00:54:44.451
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

558
00:54:45.305 --> 00:55:45.771
