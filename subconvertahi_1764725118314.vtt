00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.606
Lester likened all the tenants
to birds. his favorite hobby.

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.566
And you were the cuckoo chick!

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.736
The neediest bird of all. a taker.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.906
The taker?

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.616
Mabel. what's the first
word that comes to mind

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.786
when you think of me?

7
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.536
- Narcissist.
- What the hell?

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.640
My god.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.166
Mabel mora?

10
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.496
Althea?

11
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.256
Actually. it's thē now. I shortened it. t-h-ē.

12
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.216
Something's not adding up.

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.546
Well. I guess it wouldn't
hurt to take a little peek.

14
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.796
We're doing an autopsy?

15
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.306
A meat cleaver to the
chest. Maybe cocaine?

16
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.136
I got it! Money amounts.

17
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.806
"Brown-headed cowbird."

18
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.596
Maybe these are code names.

19
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.726
There might be a game
tonight. We have to go.

20
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.436
Lester and Nicky have both been here.

21
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.616
You're gonna get us killed by a
bunch of murderous mobsters.

22
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.526
They're all billionaires.

23
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.866
This isn't the mob. This is
the new mob of New York.

24
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.336
How does it feel to be
worth a billion dollars?

25
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.216
If I'm honest. not as good as it felt

26
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.846
to win my first hundred
dollars on a perfect bluff.

27
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.136
That was the day I fell
in love with parlor games.

28
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.450
and with winning.

29
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.590
I was five years old when I
first beat my father at chess.

30
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.936
Before that. I thought he was
the smartest person in the world.

31
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.406
Broke my heart to learn that I was.

32
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.140
that no one would beat
me for the rest of my life.

33
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.390
What fun is that?

34
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.076
The problem for most rich people
is that there's no amount of money

35
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.706
that can make 'em stop wanting more.

36
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.546
Money's a game. and they love to win.

37
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.586
I know people see me as a rich guy.
but I barely even think about money.

38
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.030
which is why I'm so normal.

39
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.966
Alright. good.

40
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.256
Take that. Throw the ball.

41
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.660
Go get it.

42
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.926
It's great getting out with the pup.

43
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.016
He can't find it. Go get it.

45
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.366
Not a typical Saturday night.

46
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.446
I think our days of typical
nights here are behind us.

47
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.616
Let's be fast about this.

48
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.230
Are we going to talk about...

49
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.166
- what was that?
- Maybe a rat?

50
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.216
Who's in here?

51
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.146
Why are the richest people
in the world in our basement?

52
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.106
And did they kill our doorman?

53
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.606
Find out next season
on... I'm taking a panorama.

54
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.666
Jay pflug has a bandaged
nub. and we have a finger.

55
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.546
I don't think it's a huge leap to
assume that our finger goes on his nub.

56
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.846
He's definitely a suspect.
At the least. he was involved.

57
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.096
Maybe the cleaver
that was in Nicky's chest

58
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.596
also chopped off Jay's finger.

59
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.346
And Lester was down there.
Maybe he saw something

60
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830
- he shouldn't have.
- Hello.

61
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.896
What the hell?

62
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.396
I'm lestr.

63
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.526
Aw. look how moved everyone is.

64
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.276
Meet our new doorman. We named him

65
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.156
after the dead one. in tribute.

66
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.196
Logic engineered secure tenant robot.

67
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.036
Those words don't even
make sense together.

68
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.286
They're trying to trick us
into thinking it's a tribute

69
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.086
- instead of the rise of the machine.
- That's true.

70
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.376
My greatest challenge is my
unsettling effect on humans.

71
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.626
Well. I've seen the Terminator.
so I'm on team machine.

72
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.216
As the keeper of the building's
secrets. the board hired me to train lestr.

73
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.306
This is so sad. A robot doorman.

74
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.726
The beginning of the
end of old New York.

75
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.346
No!

76
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.976
See. the machine will just handle
things like deliveries or reminders.

77
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.066
Thanks to the union... my union...

78
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.446
there will always be a
human face at the door.

79
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.486
Just. hopefully this human.

80
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.196
He's right. We couldn't get rid of him.

81
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.906
I just need to scan
everyone's Iris and fingerprint.

82
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.826
That thing's not getting
anywhere near my irises.

83
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.496
Alright. I'm gonna get my hair done.

84
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.110
God knows why. since
nobody ever notices.

85
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.990
What's happening to our
sweet little murder building?

86
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.580
Yeah. Things are changing fast.

87
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.596
- Are you doing toe raises?
- Yeah. I do toe raises.

88
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.266
I've never seen you do a toe raise.

89
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.726
Have you ever seen me
brush my teeth? I do that too.

90
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.026
I took winnie's doggy
ritalin. stayed up all night.

91
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.196
- and basically solved this.
- You two are a lot for me today.

92
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.706
- Vince.
- What are you doing here?

93
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.666
And look at you with two eyes.

94
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.836
Hiya. guys. Lester and
I were birding buddies.

95
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.456
So. Oliver invited me up
here to decode the ledger.

96
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.626
figure out which one of
the birds was playing cards

97
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.966
- on the night that he died.
- You birded with Lester?

98
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.506
Well. he was the expert.

99
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.466
I just followed along to keep him honest.

100
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.226
He had a knack for turning
a Robin into a bushtit...

101
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.886
if you know what I mean.

102
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.516
No one has any idea what you mean.

103
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.106
Well. he was an optimist.

104
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.106
Very good at life. but not so at birding.

105
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.316
But I miss him. I miss
our days in the park.

106
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.550
Sit. sit.

107
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.986
Okay.

108
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.946
Ho. wow!

109
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.536
An Oliver Putnam murder
board. Love the sari.

110
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.366
Yeah. from my '70s rajneesh days.

111
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.126
Please let that be a hash stain.

112
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.166
That's a lot of work. Oliver.
what happened to you?

113
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.456
Well. I thought about what
you said to me the other day

114
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.756
when you complimented
me. What'd you call me?

115
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.596
- Self-centered narcissist.
- Yes. that... that was it.

116
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.596
Anyway. I heard it.

117
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.120
So. last night. as I lay
there thinking about myself...

118
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.936
The strangest thing happened.

119
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.646
I suddenly thought about you

120
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.226
and how you always
make the murder boards.

121
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.646
So. I thought to myself. I'll do it. for you.

122
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.276
Bravo. Oliver. Bravo.

123
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.196
- What growth.
- Okay.

124
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.776
We did solve one mystery:

125
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.406
Why Lester wrote
down the player's names

126
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.536
using a secret bird code.

127
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.246
They're the most powerful
people in the world.

128
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.166
He was scared of them.

129
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.786
Somebody be recordin'. because
I am about to get birdie with it.

130
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.706
Per Lester's notes.

131
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.756
the gaming parlor usually
hosted a whole flock of birds.

132
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.676
But last Saturday. there were only five.

133
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.306
Now. first. Nicky.

134
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.426
He is the brown-headed cowbird.

135
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.726
known for their mafia-like
retaliatory behavior.

136
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.816
Oof! Okay. 'Kay. 'Kay. you
don't have to do the calls.

137
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.606
Well. it sounds like a mobster. doesn't it?

138
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.276
Next. Jay pflug. heir to the pflug fortune.

139
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.036
maker of pflug faucets. which
gave everybody lead poisoning.

140
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.326
So. they founded pflug pharma.

141
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.706
which invented a medicine
to cure lead poisoning.

142
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.286
Made billions.

143
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.996
He branded himself as. this
black sheep philanthropist.

144
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.046
but the guy is a monster.

145
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.336
His last nonprofit funneled
money to guerrilla groups.

146
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.256
The terrorists. not the primates.

147
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.676
L-Let's... let's keep it on birds.

148
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.096
He's the eurasian Jay.

149
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.226
I. too. get my bird on.

150
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.936
Okay. lotta new colors on you.

151
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.816
Anyway. since the Jay
bird is missing a claw...

152
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.856
No. I'm sorry. I'm done.

153
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.816
He's missing a finger. so. it's obviously...

154
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.026
no. no. no. We're not done.

155
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.180
Bash steed.

156
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.366
AI genius. longevity freak.

157
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.996
Way older than he looks.
but no one knows how old

158
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.376
because he owns the Internet.

159
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.416
Now. I have to find out how old he is.

160
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.706
He is the kākāpō.

161
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.756
They are known to live
up to 90 years in the wild.

162
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.120
And finally. Camila white.

163
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.436
Lifestyle queen. hotel
magnate. duchess of cashmere.

164
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.646
You can buy a candle that
smells like the inside of her nose.

165
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.026
She is the queen of decor.

166
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.856
The bowerbird. maker of beautiful nests.

167
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.576
Okay. anyways. there's a
finger in Charles's freezer

168
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.786
and we have a suspect missing a finger.

169
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.940
So. how do we get to Jay?

170
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.070
We let him know we're onto him.

171
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.046
Yes.

172
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.546
And while we here at
only murders in the building

173
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.176
we're wading into the dangerous
waters of both old mob and new.

174
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.846
Uber rich powerbrokers

175
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.936
who don't have to break
an arm to get what they want.

176
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.516
They just write a check.

177
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.146
No one writes checks anymore.

178
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.646
We already have some ideas
about who has a partial hand

179
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.776
in these two deaths. so
don't miss season five.

180
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.156
This is so good.

181
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.736
We're definitely gonna hear from him.

182
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.196
He'll wanna defend himself.

183
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.906
Post. young one!

184
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.286
I do wish we'd worked
in the word "phalange."

185
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.166
Okay. for the last time. Charles.
phalange-thropist is not a good pun.

186
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.536
That's funny.

187
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.650
To you.

188
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.136
My god. hi!

189
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.926
Althea... thē.

190
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.556
This is Oliver.

191
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.976
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi. Cute pillows.

192
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.726
Yes. I'm bequeathing them to
young Mabel for her new apartment.

193
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.896
That is so kind of you.

194
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.816
I mean. I could buy myself pillows.
it's just. these are vintage missoni.

195
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.026
Thē! Hi!

196
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.100
Howard Morris.

197
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.496
That's thē.

198
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.076
- Hello. Howard.
- Hi.

199
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.826
Thē is the number one
most downloaded artist...

200
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.586
for 13 weeks in a row.

201
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.086
Here's her current hit.

202
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.466
Glamorous! Okay.

203
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.176
My god. stop it!

204
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.976
I'm just... I'm just kidding.

205
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.306
Anyway. Mabel. how are you?
How's your little podcast going?

206
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.066
Great. We dropped our season
five teaser a few days ago.

207
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.236
Their listens are 24% lower

208
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.106
than their season four teaser.

209
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.326
Did you all hear the new
podcast drunk sluts do murder?

210
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.446
My god. yes. I love the sluts.

211
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.656
- Do people say "slut" again?
- Sluts do.

212
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.826
Did you hear the one where
they play strip beer pong

213
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.786
- with the forensics expert?
- Beyond.

214
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.536
Drunk sluts do murder

215
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.496
are ranked 19 spots
higher than only murders...

216
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.716
no. No. don't feel bad.

217
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.626
Don't feel bad. It's just
'cause wondify is. like.

218
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.506
shoving the sluts down
our throats. you know?

219
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.530
It's so hard to get noticed
when you're indie. right?

220
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.136
We actually just signed
a huge deal at wondify.

221
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.226
So. be prepared to have
us down your throats. too.

222
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.976
We did?

223
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.016
I mean. I... I still can't believe it.

224
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.106
That is amazing! My god.
so you know what you need?

225
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.026
You need my publicist. He's so intuitive.

226
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.446
He's psychic. and he's a hired assassin.

227
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.776
But you did not hear that from me. okay?

228
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.406
Bye. Howard! Bye. robot.

229
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.680
- Bye. girl!
- Bye. girl.

230
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.126
So. I lied. but maybe
that's not a bad thing.

231
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.376
because now I'm sending
in this kick-ass pitch.

232
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.836
and they'll offer us a podcast deal. right?

233
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.006
I mean. there's already a movie about us.

234
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.886
and I... i'm. you know. just shocked

235
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.056
that they haven't come
to us already. you know?

236
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.250
Mabel. why did you do this?

237
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.146
Okay. fine.

238
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.090
Althea and I were each other's
only friend in middle school.

239
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.146
I trusted her with everything.

240
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.276
And we'd make these stupid little videos

241
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.196
where we'd play these
characters. sunny and cloudy.

242
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.406
Sunny was optimistic.
Cloudy was. well. cloudy.

243
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.786
- And you were cloudy.
- No. I was sunny.

244
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.576
So that's the joke.

245
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.150
- What do you mean?
- Just continue.

246
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:05.086
Anyway. then when Zoe
died... Zoe... is a familiar name.

247
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.256
Oliver. Mabel's friend. The roof.

248
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.266
From season one!

249
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.976
My god. that was so sad.

250
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.266
Yeah. well. I... I wasn't doing that great.

251
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.170
I stayed here for the
summer and depressed.

252
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.486
And then. when I went home.
althea had completely changed.

253
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.066
She had made all new friends
and turned everyone against me.

254
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.866
I kind of spiraled and
spent the rest of high school

255
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.536
in my room with tumblr.

256
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.156
That's a pornography site.

257
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.366
Not anymore. They ruined it.

258
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:41.086
Well. now. the person who has
turned me off having friends...

259
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.190
is here at number one
while we are 32. and...

260
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.596
Are my old-men friends
texting while I trauma dump?

261
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.136
Jay pflug just sent us a video.

262
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.766
Hey. podcasters. heard your teaser.

263
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.606
Sounds like you have some thoughts.
I'll be by at 7:00 to clear things up.

264
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.146
Shit.

265
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.510
Om... A billionaire is coming to dinner.

266
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.076
Champagne. caviar. godiva.

267
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.246
This is what you're serving
a billionaire for dinner?

268
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.996
No. no. no. we don't serve dinner.

269
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.376
We serve salty sweets
to make him thirsty.

270
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.466
then offer him nothing
to drink but bubbly.

271
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.046
He'll get blackout and tell
us everything. This is my way.

272
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.676
Yes. let's get a possible murderer
hangry and drunk. Great plan.

273
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.176
If you invite someone over at
7:00. you have to serve 'em dinner.

274
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.040
It's a rule of society.
And that's why I brought...

275
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.306
What is that. the magna cart a?

276
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.066
No. it's my great-gran's
recipe for duck à I'orange.

277
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.856
It's a billionaire's delight.

278
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.696
Charles. no one needs your
17th-century old lady food

279
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.446
and outdated social rules.

280
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.050
Do you know how many
billionaires I've entertained here?

281
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.946
Well. technically none.
but plenty of millionaires.

282
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.786
which were the billionaires of the '80s.

283
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.786
Alright. we are
interrogating. not entertaining.

284
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.376
Yeah. but you need one for the other.

285
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.336
This is one of the
richest people on earth.

286
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.916
He wants courses. Many. many courses.

287
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.506
- Etiquette is not dead.
- I think etiquette died

288
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.716
four months after the
Internet was invented.

289
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.966
and that guy's head went
into an elephant's ass.

290
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.846
Well.

291
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.556
He's early. He's an early bird.

292
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.920
Okay. okay.

293
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.526
Jay. welcome. Come in.

294
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.066
I come bearing gifts.

295
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.436
Never show up empty-handed.

296
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.816
Though. I'm a little handicapped.
if you don't mind grabbing that.

297
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.760
Ho. Beer. how generous.

298
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.890
Stoked to meet you all.

299
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.036
One of the reasons why I play cards
here is because it's the murder building.

300
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.746
and that is all because of you.

301
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.296
Well. we give a lot of
credit to the murderers.

302
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.296
Say. so. what has you playing
cards in our famous velvet room?

303
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.160
You know. I started a few months ago...

304
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.266
Man. I knew I was being followed.

305
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.686
Good evening. Camila white.

306
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.316
Isn't this an assaulting
amount of everything?

307
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.350
Better.

308
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.286
My goodness.

309
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.916
Jay. is that you?

310
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.666
I had no idea you'd be here.

311
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.916
Well. I heard the podcast.
and it seemed like these people

312
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.086
thought you were
involved in the mob killing.

313
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.556
Camila white. charmed. Camila white.

314
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.830
Dear god. A plum plaid.

315
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.146
So. I'm here to clear Jay's name.

316
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.436
Fuck off. Camila. I'm
here to clear my name.

317
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.316
You were worried about
what I'd say about you.

318
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.686
That is certainly not true.

319
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.486
and I don't like the ugly use
of words that end in hard ks.

320
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.116
Shall we begin again?

321
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.970
Softer consonants?

322
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.970
Our host brought four chocolates.

323
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.850
Hello. Sebastian steed.

324
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.110
No... I'd invite you in if
I had more chocolates.

325
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.886
My god. You're spying on us.

326
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.430
Of course he is. he owns the Internet.

327
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.016
Just stopping by for a drink. bash?

328
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.516
No. I'm here because
they're investigating you.

329
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.396
Naturally. I've been having you followed.

330
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.476
I knew you'd try to pin it on me.

331
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.226
Thanks for your robot-like honesty.

332
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.380
You're welcome.

333
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.986
Well. we're really having a party here.

334
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.326
Please. have a seat.

335
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.350
Whoo!

336
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.770
Who needs champagne?

337
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.400
I'll have a '97 Bordeaux.

338
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.336
- I don't think I have that.
- Truly.

339
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.296
any '97 Bordeaux will do.

340
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.780
I don't have any'97 Bordeaux.

341
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.346
So. I'm noticing three of
the richest people in the world

342
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.346
are here in our little building.

343
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.106
I'm top three. they're top 20.

344
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.186
Sebastian. on many lists I'm four.

345
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.356
The point is that you
all seem a little nervous

346
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.276
about what our little
investigation has uncovered.

347
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.946
No one's nervous.

348
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.866
We're all here for one reason. Yeah?

349
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.196
Yes. To give you the opportunity

350
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.456
to keep us out of your podcast
before we sue you for libel.

351
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.456
Libel. wow.

352
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.586
Let's... let's just turn
down the temp a tad.

353
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.796
and. let's nibble some caviar...

354
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.120
oops. I'm so sorry.

355
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.556
There really wasn't very much.

356
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.250
It's not libel to say we found you
sniffing around a murder scene.

357
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.726
What do you mean?

358
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.476
The news said that the body was found

359
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.936
hanging from a rack
in his own dry cleaners?

360
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.026
Yes. I... I don't know why
you're even looking into this.

361
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.276
I mean. my people say you
do murders in the building.

362
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.946
It's an odd business model.
this "in the building" rule.

363
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.746
Your metrics would
improve with a wider net.

364
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.366
Bash. always be talking metrics.

365
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.496
Well. the dry cleaners
is on the street level.

366
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.836
so technically. it is "of" the building.

367
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.126
Listen. nobody wants to sue anyone.

368
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.796
We just can't have our names
tied to secret card games

369
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.586
and dead mobsters. you know?

370
00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.466
My stock crashes. and tens of thousands

371
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.596
of indigenous weavers go hungry.

372
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.886
Because she fires 'em.

373
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.330
Yes. why else would they go hungry?

374
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.016
So. the three of you knew the
"dry cleaning king of Brooklyn"?

375
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.606
The dead mobster? Not at all.

376
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.590
I know he owned the gaming parlor.

377
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.866
The mobby shit's always been
part of what makes the place so cool.

378
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.736
What's there to investigate?

379
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.246
A mob hit is very open and
shut. Won't be your best season.

380
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.326
Well. we're also investigating
the death of our doorman.

381
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.350
Did you know him?

382
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.836
I mean. there was a guy
who always covered the door

383
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.176
for the Saturday
games. Gray mustache?

384
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.676
That was Lester. It
was ruled natural causes

385
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.966
because of a fall.

386
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:09.056
Yes. falls are the leading cause
of injury deaths in the elderly.

387
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.636
- You two. be careful.
- Our pilates instructor says we have

388
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.686
- the gait stability of 46-year-olds.
- It's true.

389
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.186
If you're serious about age-reversal.

390
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.856
you have to consider
plasma replacement therapy.

391
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.670
I own a stable of teen plasma donors.

392
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.076
We have reason to believe that
Nicky died last week when Lester died.

393
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.366
There were signs that Nicky was frozen.

394
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.286
Someone hid his body to make
it look like they were unrelated.

395
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.956
You got your hands on the body.

396
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.036
Wow.

397
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.336
I mean. can you admit that

398
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.876
on a podcast? That's a felony. right?

399
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.296
I'm sure they went to the
authorities immediately.

400
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.346
You know what. let's
get you some more caviar.

401
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.306
- Absolutely.
- Let's get it. I think there's more caviar

402
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.386
- in the kitchen.
- I'm good.

403
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.226
- We definitely have Bologna.
- And.

404
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.306
I think there's a fresher bottle.

405
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.936
Okay. okay. okay. I was
not prepared for all three.

406
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.856
Are they making veiled
threats or being charming?

407
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.026
I can't tell.

408
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.816
Let's split them up and see
what they say about Jay's finger.

409
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.616
I'll take Jay because we're not old.

410
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.866
And Charles should take
bash because they're both. well.

411
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.770
what we used to call "the weird kid."

412
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.140
Aw.

413
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.246
Camila! I... I just have
a few more questions.

414
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.046
Can I give you a tour?

415
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.070
Fine.

416
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.046
If you can stop yelling.
a tour before dinner.

417
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.806
Dinner! I said we need dinner.

418
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.250
Of course. a party at 7:00 means dinner.

419
00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.120
Thank you. bash! Gimme a hand?

420
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.266
If the servants don't mind.

421
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.170
The servants aren't gonna mind.

422
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220
Beer?

423
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.680
So. Jay...

424
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.810
How'd you lose the finger?

425
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.110
How'd those two old guys
become your best friends?

426
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.860
Nice.

427
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.716
So. how well do you know Jay?

428
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.476
Have you... have you two
been playing together for long?

429
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.766
All I know about Jay

430
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.056
is he has a tantrum like
a toddler when he loses...

431
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.776
- Ooh.
- Which is tragic and amusing.

432
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.776
I'm sorry. but every room
in this house needs me.

433
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.236
Are those the statler and
Waldorf balconies on your wall?

434
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.036
Ha! Well. I'm... I'm a theater director.

435
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.400
So. you thought. "I should put
theater directing on my walls"?

436
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.916
Well. but. the... the beauty of
this place is really its stories.

437
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.046
Like my ex-wife. loved these drapes.

438
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.296
so I fought to keep them out of spite.

439
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.556
Not necessarily my finest moment.

440
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.750
but. not all the stories in here are great.

441
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.790
Well. this looks great.

442
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.010
This is great. It's my new wife.

443
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.800
And she moved in... to all this?

444
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:17.116
Well. n... not yet. but.
you know. I mean...

445
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.286
I love duck à I'orange.

446
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.746
During the war we only
had duck at Christmas.

447
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.706
And... and which war was that?

448
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.190
"Three sprigs of parsley." I'll chop.

449
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.926
Haven't cooked in decades.

450
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.896
So. you haven't used
a... a cleaver in a while.

451
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.856
You know anybody else who
might have used a cleaver?

452
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.436
- Anybody?
- Isn't it interesting?

453
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.686
None of us will leave
behind written recipes.

454
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.986
Future generations will just
have bookmarks on chef robots.

455
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.696
Yeah. it's. it's true. it's sad.

456
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.526
You know. the... the times are changing.

457
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.616
especially for us old guys in
our... how old did you say you were?

458
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.020
That depends on the organ.

459
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.046
Charles. wallowing
takes six years off your life.

460
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.376
Dorothy Parker told me
that. She took my virginity.

461
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.046
Point is. you're only old if you
don't change with the times.

462
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.966
You know. technology's
helped me stay young.

463
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.160
But reinvention is the real key.

464
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.250
Yeah. that... it... it takes
a lot of energy keeping up.

465
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.476
Yeah. it does.

466
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.566
Every time I've put a wife in
assisted living and had to start over.

467
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.646
I've had moments of
doubt that I could do it.

468
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.026
But I did.

469
00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.050
And you can.

470
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.696
Well. thank you.

471
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.036
Now. how much orange
zest goes in great-gran's...

472
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.996
no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

473
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.036
My great-gran is gone!

474
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.610
It's gone.

475
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.586
No!

476
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.666
How much orange zest

477
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.716
is in Charles-haden savage's
great-gran's duck à I'orange recipe?

478
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.886
There are one-and-a-half teaspoons

479
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.516
of orange zest in that recipe.

480
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.250
How did it know that?

481
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.686
Show me Charles-haden
savage making duck à I'orange.

482
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.976
That sounds like a lot of zest. brazzos.

483
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.476
I'm zesty. Regis.

484
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.106
Yes. you're a multi-talented guy.

485
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.396
I admire guys like that. that
could do more than one thing.

486
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.066
I just revel in it.

487
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.406
Probably in ten minutes. something
unbelievable is gonna happen.

488
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.576
Why do I think it's gonna be
me making your duck à I'orange?

489
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.746
Well. Regis. because you're psychic.

490
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.036
We're gonna take a commercial break

491
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.286
and make it happen in the next segment.

492
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.586
I forgot I did that.

493
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.626
My great-gran lives on.

494
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.650
Thank you.

495
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.626
This is why I do what I do.

496
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.806
In the right hands. technology
should keep the past alive. preserved.

497
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.386
like I'm preserved every night
floating in my tank of collagen.

498
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.896
I also had a sad home.

499
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.726
My first one.

500
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.736
A young girl with a deep love of beauty.

501
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.566
born to a casino magnate
and his former showgirl wife.

502
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.326
raised amidst a sea of hot pink in Reno.

503
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.866
Eww. so sorry.

504
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:09.666
The moment I turned 18.
I moved... to Connecticut.

505
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.836
Leaving that home

506
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.166
jump-started my mission
to beautify the world.

507
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.836
and it turned me into a billionaire.

508
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.200
And I started with nothing.

509
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.886
So. are... are you
saying that Loretta and I

510
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.186
should start fresh? Get a new place?

511
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.556
These bones are remarkable.

512
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.840
You just need to change everything.

513
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.236
So. come on. the finger?

514
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.526
I gotta know.

515
00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.286
The only crime I'm guilty of is
being an embarrassing nepo baby

516
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.456
who's trying to do some good
with his ancestors' blood money.

517
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.916
Yeah. and how's that going?

518
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.336
I started my own nonprofit. hired a ceo.

519
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.336
a friend of mine I trusted.
who then took all the money.

520
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.096
Everyone thinks I'm a swindler.

521
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.620
but really. I'm just shit
at knowing who to trust.

522
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.016
I'm sure it'll happen again.

523
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.580
Then. why keep trying?

524
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.130
Because I wanna prove to
everyone that I'm not a... fuck up.

525
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.850
Are you aware of the pop sensation thē?

526
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.576
The "the" girl? Yeah. why?

527
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.496
She is someone I incorrectly trusted.

528
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.796
She couldn't be more frustrating.

529
00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.876
and I... I can't stop
wanting to impress her.

530
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.426
So. I lied and said we were
getting a deal at wondify.

531
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.886
and we aren't.

532
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.306
So. now I have to try
to make that happen.

533
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.016
I'm sure it won't.

534
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.710
And I hate myself for that.

535
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.186
I will literally kill you.

536
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.156
She wrote that. I feel like. about me.

537
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.930
It's really good. It's catchy.

538
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.406
I was playing with these
bozos the night Nicky died.

539
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.230
but I did not kill anyone.

540
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.350
So. what happened with your finger?

541
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.796
Just another bad decision in
a long line of bad decisions.

542
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.806
While we have a quiet moment.

543
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.200
I wanna help you make sure
you stay out of our little story.

544
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.370
But what happened to Jay's finger?

545
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880
Fine.

546
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.276
The night Lester died.

547
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.946
Nicky showed up with this cleaver.

548
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.156
Wa... was he mad at
someone? Maybe Jay?

549
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.406
He was livid and raving
about the film "good fellows"?

550
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.916
He had an inordinate
amount of white powder

551
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.536
under his nose.

552
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.296
I'd call it a snow white white.

553
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.336
or perhaps a Santa's beard white.

554
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.756
He was nuts.

555
00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.006
He was gonna hit
someone. I tried to stop him.

556
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.096
I mean. bash is covered in baby skin.

557
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.636
but he's pretty old.

558
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.846
Well. I tried to calm him down.
but Jay had to be the hero.

559
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.346
and so Nicky... "chh!"...
Chopped off his finger.

560
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.460
I obviously left because of the mess.

561
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.276
And also. it's rude to be
the last to leave a party. so...

562
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.276
I told Jay not to escalate. but
chop-chop. Then we all ran out.

563
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.350
There wasn't time to look
for it. which is why I went back.

564
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.786
It'd be nice not to have a
finger floating around. ya know?

565
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.650
You didn't happen to
see it in there. did you?

566
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.996
Okay. Duck à I'orange

567
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.996
is ready in two hours and 45 minutes.

568
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.546
- Who's hungry?
- I don't eat after 11 A.M..

569
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.586
but have we answered
all your questions?

570
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.926
Well. yes. I learned that
Nicky chopped off Jay's finger.

571
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.426
and then bash. Camila. and Jay ran out.

572
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.726
- Yeah. that's what Jay said.
- And Lester and Nicky

573
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.096
were still alive. so...

574
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.846
Look at you two not lying to pin it on me.

575
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.396
- You do care.
- Case closed.

576
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.106
And now that we've cleared this up.

577
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.236
I trust I won't hear my
name on future episodes.

578
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.946
Okay. duck à I'orange in
two hours and 44 minutes.

579
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.406
Next time.

580
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.706
Forgot I have some friends coming
over to do some rock climbing.

581
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.350
Mabel... Thanks.

582
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.940
It was a really nice talk.

583
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.546
Touching food again was pleasant.

584
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.070
Enjoy the remodel.

585
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.740
Wait. what remodel?

586
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.896
Wow. this really is much better.

587
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.566
How did we not hear anything?

588
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.880
She's a home decor witch!

589
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.786
This is better. The hot glue fumes

590
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.456
from my apartment
jump-started my hangover.

591
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.206
Does champagne expire?

592
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.786
You should really lay off the alcohol.

593
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.336
Bash says it inflames your enzymes.

594
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.466
Now. which war would
you think was going on

595
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.216
when Dorothy Parker
was in her sexual prime?

596
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.346
First sexual prime. or second?

597
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.216
How crazy is it that we have
Jay pflug's finger in your freezer?

598
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.136
At least we figured that out.

599
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.096
So. we're gonna believe these three?

600
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.306
Please. Camila is no killer.

601
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.356
Although. I felt like I was
spending a couple of hours

602
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.026
with a cross between Ann-Margret
and nanette fabray. so I almost died.

603
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.946
Jay didn't do it.

604
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.036
He was just trying to protect everyone.

605
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.786
He's. sweeter than I expected.

606
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.060
Mabel...

607
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.126
Did your eyelashes just flutter?

608
00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.546
Oliver. Jay makes
Mabel's eyelashes flutter.

609
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.426
No. I'm n... shut up. I'm not fluttering.

610
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.676
It's just maybe we should
give him his finger back.

611
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.716
Crushing on a suspect. Mabel?

612
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.886
This is really a Charles storyline. isn't it?

613
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.806
If both of you couple up.

614
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:04.606
that leaves me birding with
Vince. or getting a drink with a robot.

615
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.726
My god. you guys.
wondify wants to sign us.

616
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.816
They said that they would love to have us

617
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.116
come see the studio and
become part of the wondify family.

618
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.446
- Your email worked!
- You're kidding.

619
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.116
Take that. thē.

620
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.616
Whoa. wish that you were us. bitch!

621
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.406
Whoa. I didn't mean for that to come out.

622
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.746
Wish that you were us. ma'am.

623
00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.626
- I'm very excited.
- Me too.

624
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.586
Welcome. omitb!

625
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.846
Congratulations. you have
a beautiful baby podcast.

626
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.306
We're so excited.

627
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.806
Let me give you a tour.
okay? I love the stripes.

628
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.250
- Thanks.
- It's fab.

629
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.146
Some of our smaller
studios are that way.

630
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.436
You're gonna love this.
Those are the drunk sluts.

631
00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.146
Such champs. recorded
seven episodes today.

632
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.316
My god... you're killin' it. ladies!

633
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.736
Hi!

634
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.826
Okay.

635
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.746
- This is your studio.
- Whoa. What?

636
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.366
Really?

637
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.496
- Okay.
- Yeah.

638
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.126
My god.

639
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.036
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Water.

640
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.706
Hello. how are you?

641
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.296
- Your camera operator.
- Hi.

642
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.876
- Your engineer.
- Hi.

643
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.256
- Hi.
- Look at the awards.

644
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.966
- It's insane.
- Okay. this'll do.

645
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.990
Okay.

646
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.306
So. per the contract. we'll relaunch you

647
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.886
with a month-long stint
on our welcome page.

648
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.096
I told your lawyer between makeup lines

649
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.580
and elder safety devices.
you're an advertising juggernaut.

650
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.316
Well. the timing couldn't be better.

651
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.316
I mean. considering
who we're investigating.

652
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.156
we could use a little extra firepower.

653
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.156
And it's a cast of
characters you dream of.

654
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.446
You know. an... an adulterous mob wife.

655
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.906
Sebastian steed and Camila
white running for their lives

656
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.156
after a mobster chops
off Jay pflug's finger.

657
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.360
Incredible. Just one thing... sorry. Guys?

658
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.320
Which way do your pointers curve?

659
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.716
They point away from each other.

660
00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.160
- Never noticed that.
- Yeah.

661
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.160
Jay lost his right finger.

662
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.660
The finger we have curves left.

663
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.596
That lying piece of shit.

664
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.186
- This isn't his finger.
- So. who... whose finger is it?

665
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.186
You mean. they were lying
when they told us what happened?

666
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.816
They had gotten their stories straight.

667
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.316
Someone else was
in the room that night.

668
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.276
someone that Lester didn't
put in his little bird ledger.

669
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.156
Well. I'm ready to start recording.

670
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.536
I'm gonna take that
little nepo baby down.

671
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.246
Wow. what a twist.

672
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.376
Just keep in mind the restrictions of
the corporate machine we have here.

673
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.086
Sorry? What restrictions?

674
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.086
Well. per the contract you just signed.

675
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.506
you're unable to podcast about
management of the company.

676
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.256
Conflict of interest.

677
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.530
And we have new majority
stakeholders as of very recently.

678
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.556
Who?

679
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.646
The easiest way to win a game

680
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.606
is to make your opponent
think they're playing

681
00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.640
a different game entirely.

682
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.246
- I confided in Jay.
- They joined forces.

683
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.076
They're all dirty.

684
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.116
While focused on that game.

685
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.786
your opponent may give
you just what you need

686
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.690
to win the real prize.

687
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.046
God. don't worry.
