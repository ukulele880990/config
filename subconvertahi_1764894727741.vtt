richest people on Earth.

338
00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.865
He wants courses.
Many. many courses.

339
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.451
-Etiquette is not dead.
-I think etiquette died

340
00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.662
four months after the
internet was invented.

341
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.915
and that guy's head went
into an elephant's ass.

342
00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:17.792
-Ah. well.
-[knocking at door]

343
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.502
[whispering] He's early.
He's an early bird.

344
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.920
[Oliver] [whispering]
Okay. okay.

345
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.466
Oh. Jay. welcome. Come in.

346
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.009
I come bearing gifts.

347
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.386
-Ah.
-Never show up empty-handed.

348
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.764
Though. I'm a little handicapped.
if you don't mind grabbing that.

349
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.766
Oh-ho. Beer. how generous.

350
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:38.896
Ah. stoked to meet you all.

351
00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.984
One of the reasons why I play cards here
is because it's the murder building.

352
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:45.695
and that is all because of you.

353
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.239
Well. we give a lot of
credit to the murderers.

354
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:52.243
Say. so. uh. what has you playing
cards in our famous Velvet Room?

355
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.163
-You know. I started a few months ago...
-[doorbell ringing]

356
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.582
-[scoffs]
-[sighs]

357
00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:03.212
Man. I knew I was
being followed.

358
00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.297
[sighs]

359
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.634
Good evening. Camila White.

360
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.720
[♪ Plucky curious music playing]

361
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:15.266
Oh. isn't this an assaulting
amount of everything?

362
00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.268
[sighs deeply]

363
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.352
Better.

364
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.233
Oh. my goodness.

365
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.861
Jay. is that you?

366
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.614
-I had no idea you'd be here.
-Mm-hmm.

367
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.866
Well. I heard the podcast. and
it seemed like these people

368
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.035
thought you were involved
in the mob killing.

369
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:37.497
Camila White.
charmed. Camila White.

370
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.833
Oh. dear God. A plum plaid.

371
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.087
So. I'm here to
clear Jay's name.

372
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.381
Fuck off. Camila. I'm
here to clear my name.

373
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.259
You were worried about
what I'd say about you.

374
00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.636
That is certainly not true.

375
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:55.431
and I don't like the ugly use
of words that end in hard Ks.

376
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.058
Shall we begin again?

377
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.976
-Softer consonants?
-[doorbell ringing]

378
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.979
[whispering] Our host
brought four chocolates.

379
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.859
Hello. Sebastian Steed.

380
00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.113
No... I'd invite you in
if I had more chocolates.

381
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:12.823
[Oliver sighs]

382
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.827
Oh. my God. You're spying on us.

383
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.431
Of course he is. he
owns the internet.

384
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.957
Just stopping by
for a drink. Bash?

385
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.460
No. I'm here because
they're investigating you.

386
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.337
Naturally. I've been
having you followed.

387
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.422
I knew you'd try
to pin it on me.

388
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.175
Thanks for your
robot-like honesty.

389
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.385
You're welcome.

390
00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.933
Well. we're really
having a party here.

391
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.268
Please. have a seat.

392
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.352
[Charles] Whoo!

393
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.774
Who needs champagne?

394
00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.651
-[grunting]
-[cork popping]

395
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.403
Oh. I'll have a '97 Bordeaux.

396
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.281
-I don't think I have that.
-[Camila] Oh. truly.

397
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.242
any '97 Bordeaux will
do. [softly chuckles]

398
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.786
I don't have any'97 Bordeaux.

399
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:05.293
So. I'm noticing three of the
richest people in the world

400
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:07.295
are here in our little building.

401
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:09.046
I'm top three. they're top 20.

402
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.132
Sebastian. on many
lists I'm four.

403
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:14.302
Uh. the point is that you
all seem a little nervous

404
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.221
about what our little
investigation has uncovered.

405
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.889
No one's nervous.

406
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.809
We're all here for
one reason. Yeah?

407
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:24.145
Yes. To give you the opportunity

408
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:27.398
to keep us out of your podcast
before we sue you for libel.

409
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.275
[Oliver spits out
champagne. chuckles]

410
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.402
Libel. wow. [laughing]

411
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:34.530
Let's... let's just turn
down the temp a tad.

412
00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.741
and. uh. let's
nibble some caviar...

413
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:37.908
-[snorts]
-[Jay crunching]

414
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.619
[Oliver] Oh.

415
00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.120
[Jay Pflug] Oops. I'm so sorry.

416
00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:43.497
There really wasn't very much.

417
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.251
It's not libel to say we found you
sniffing around a murder scene.

418
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.671
What do you mean?

419
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.423
The news said that
the body was found

420
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:54.884
hanging from a rack in
his own dry cleaners?

421
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.970
Yes. I... I don't know why
you're even looking into this.

422
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:01.223
I mean. my people say you
do murders in the building.

423
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.893
It's an odd business model.
this "in the building" rule.

424
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.687
Your metrics would
improve with a wider net.

425
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.315
Bash. always be talking metrics.

426
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:11.442
Well. the dry cleaners
is on the street level.

427
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.778
so technically. it
is "of" the building.

428
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:17.073
Listen. nobody
wants to sue anyone.

429
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.742
We just can't have our names
tied to secret card games

430
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.535
-and dead mobsters. you know?
-[Camila] Mm.

431
00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.413
My stock crashes.
and tens of thousands

432
00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.540
of indigenous weavers go hungry.

433
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:27.833
Because she fires 'em.

434
00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.336
Yes. why else would
they go hungry?

435
00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.965
So. the three of you knew the
"Dry Cleaning King of Brooklyn"?

436
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.551
The dead mobster? Not at all.

437
00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.595
I know he owned
the gaming parlor.

438
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.808
The mobby shit's always been part
of what makes the place so cool.

439
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.685
What's there to investigate?

440
00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:49.188
A mob hit is very open and
shut. Won't be your best season.

441
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.274
Well. we're also investigating
the death of our doorman.

442
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.359
Did you know him?

443
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:58.781
I mean. there was a guy
who always covered the door

444
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.117
for the Saturday games.
Uh. gray mustache?

445
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.619
That was Lester. It was
ruled natural causes

446
00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:04.912
because of a fall.

447
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.999
Yes. falls are the leading cause
of injury deaths in the elderly.

448
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.585
-You two. be careful.
-Our Pilates instructor says we have

449
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.629
-the gait stability of 46-year-olds.
-It's true.

450
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.131
[Bash] If you're serious
about age-reversal.

451
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.800
you have to consider
plasma replacement therapy.

452
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.678
I own a stable of
teen plasma donors.

453
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:26.016
We have reason to believe that Nicky
died last week when Lester died.

454
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.310
There were signs that
Nicky was frozen.

455
00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:32.231
Someone hid his body to make it
look like they were unrelated.

456
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.900
Oh. you got your
hands on the body.

457
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:35.985
[Jay] Wow.

458
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.278
I mean. can you admit that

459
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.822
on a podcast? That's
a felony. right?

460
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.241
I'm sure they went to the
authorities immediately.

461
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:43.325
[Camila] Mm.

462
00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.829
[♪ Soft suspenseful
music playing]

463
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.290
Mm-hmm. Um. you know what.
let's get you some more caviar.

464
00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:51.250
-Mm. Absolutely.
-Let's get it. I think there's more caviar

465
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.335
-in the kitchen.
-I'm good.

466
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.170
-[Oliver] We definitely have bologna.
-[Charles] And. uh.

467
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.255
I think there's
a fresher bottle.

468
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.884
Okay. okay. okay. I was
not prepared for all three.

469
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.803
Are they making veiled
threats or being charming?

470
00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:02.970
I can't tell.

471
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.765
Let's split them up and see what
they say about Jay's finger.

472
00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.558
I'll take Jay because
we're not old.

473
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.811
And Charles should take Bash
because they're both. well.

474
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.771
what we used to call
"the weird kid."

475
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.148
[clicking tongue] Aw.

476
00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.196
Camila! I... I just have
a few more questions.

477
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.989
Can I give you a tour?

478
00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.073
Fine.

479
00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:27.995
If you can stop yelling.
a tour before dinner.

480
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.748
Dinner! I said we need dinner.

481
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:33.250
Of course. a party
at 7:00 means dinner.

482
00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:36.128
Thank you. Bash! Gimme a hand?

483
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.215
If the servants don't mind.

484

servants aren't gonna mind.

become your best friends?

Have you... have you two been
playing together for long?

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.710
All I know about Jay

496
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:20.005
is he has a tantrum like
a toddler when he loses...

497
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:22.716
-Ooh.
-...which is tragic and amusing.

Waldorf balconies on your wall?

theater director. [chuckles]

theater directing on my walls"?

that. She took my virginity.

you don't change with the times.

[mouth full] This is
better. The hot glue fumes

684
00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:57.397
from my apartment
jump-started my hangover.

685
00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.149
Does champagne expire?

686
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:01.735
Oh. you should really
lay off the alcohol.

687

Uh. Bash says it
inflames your enzymes.

688
00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:06.406
Now. which war would
you think was going on

689
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.159
when Dorothy Parker was
in her sexual prime?

690
00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:11.286
First sexual prime. or second?

691
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.165
How crazy is it that we have Jay
Pflug's finger in your freezer?

692
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:17.084
At least we figured that out.

693
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:20.045
So. we're gonna
believe these three?

694
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.255
Oh. please. Camila is no killer.

695
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:25.300
Although. I felt like I was
spending a couple of hours

696
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:28.970
with a cross between Ann-Margret and
Nanette Fabray. so I almost died.

698
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.892
Jay didn't do it.

699
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.977
He was just trying
to protect everyone.

700
00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:39.731
He's. um... sweeter
than I expected.

Oliver. Jay makes Mabel's
eyelashes flutter.

704
00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:50.367
No. I'm n... Shut up.
I'm not fluttering.

705
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.620
It's just maybe we should
give him his finger back.

Well. the timing
couldn't be better.

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.260
I mean. considering who
we're investigating.

753
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:35.096
we could use a little
extra firepower.

And it's a cast of
characters you dream of.

-This isn't his finger.
-So. who... Whose finger is it?

767
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:12.134
You mean. they were lying when
they told us what happened?

768
00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:13.760
[Oliver] They had gotten
their stories straight.

769
00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:16.263
Someone else was in
the room that night.

put in his little bird ledger.

start recording.

Wow. what a twist.

774
00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:28.316
Just keep in mind the restrictions of
the corporate machine we have here.

775
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.026
Sorry? What restrictions?

776
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.028
Well. per the contract
you just signed.

777

management of the company.

[Camila] The easiest
way to win a game

783
00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:58.555
is to make your opponent
think they're playing

784
00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:00.640
a different game entirely.

-They joined forces.

[Bash] While focused
on that game.

788
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:11.735
your opponent may give
you just what you need

to win the real prize.

Oh God. don't worry.

791

If eliminating those three takes
the teeth out of this story.
