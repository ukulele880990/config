Narcos 1x06: Explosivos

3
00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:13.130
<i>Pablo's path was total war.</i>

4
00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:18.260
<i>He established a bounty system for killing
cops and over 200 were slaughtered.</i>

5
00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.639
<i>The police had to build a special morgue
just to hold the bodies.</i>

6
00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:27.644
<i>The cops.
they took vengeance.</i>

7
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:36.320
My name is Alba Borraga.
born 1962 in Popayán.

8
00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:39.447
Father Sandoval. mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.

9
00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:44.203
I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

10
00:04:44.286 --> 00:04:46.121
OK. try it again and look at me.

11
00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:48.040
I've already done it 17 times.

12
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.000
You got me and my wife into this.

13
00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:53.420
Now sit down and do it again
until you get it right.

14
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.550
My name is Alba Borraga.
born 1962 in Popayán.

15
00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.261
Father Sandoval. mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.

16
00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:06.933
I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

17
00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:09.811
What if they ask me
a question about chemistry?

18
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.605
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...

19
00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.108
Sit down. Do it again.
It's getting better.

20
00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:18.070
<i>We were protecting Elisa</i>

21
00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:21.656
<i>because she could tie Escobar
to the Palace of Justice...</i>

22
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.203
<i>but by protecting a communist.
we were traitors.</i>

23
00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:27.620
<i>Go figure.</i>

24
00:06:31.477 --> 00:06:32.769
Let's go.

25
00:06:35.063 --> 00:06:36.982
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

26
00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:40.986
Honey. thank you.

27
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.739
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead. too.

28
00:06:44.823 --> 00:06:46.283
Yeah. but we're not a death squad. OK?

29
00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:48.868
You clearly don't know
your country's history in Latin America.

30
00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:52.456
- Sorry. I didn't hear that...
- Honey. mellow out. OK?

31
00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:11.183
Steve. I know you're mad.
but this is the right thing to do.

32
00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:13.852
The right thing to do? I didn't have
a choice in the matter. did I?

33
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.188
<i>This is the only choice.</i>

34
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:18.606
<i>You should
think about going back to Miami.</i>

35
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.568
They're in their car. Hold on.

36
00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:24.488
Wow. Maybe I will.

37
00:07:24.696 --> 00:07:26.448
Just get in the car. OK?

38
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.330
OK. OK. they're on the move.

39
00:07:33.413 --> 00:07:35.165
Go. Go. go. go.

40
00:07:42.714 --> 00:07:47.511
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.

41
00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:51.348
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.

42
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.476
Just keep your head down
and this'll all be over soon enough.

43
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.769
We're gonna cut him off
up here on the left.

44
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.821
Get out of the car. Murphy!

45
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:08.532
Get out!

46
00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:12.077
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?

47
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.580
- Move him away.
- Easy.

48
00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:15.581
- Easy.
- Back!

49
00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:17.332
- Come on. Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...

50
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.917
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!

51
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.293
- You spying on me?
- Relax. Murphy!

52
00:08:20.377 --> 00:08:22.295
Who the fuck were you talking to?

53
00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:26.383
The fuck is she?

54
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.976
Stand down.

55
00:08:39.062 --> 00:08:41.940
Who were you talking to. huh?

56
00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.024
Peña.

57
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.777
I got wife troubles.

58
00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:49.030
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.

59
00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:53.285
Your husband was clever
to get them to follow him.

60
00:08:53.368 --> 00:08:54.994
I hope he's OK.

61
00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.416
Shit.

62
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:23.064
I'm sorry. sir.
I'm American. I don't speak Spanish.

63
00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:37.078
Uh. documents.

64
00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:33.092
Gracias. señor.

65
00:10:42.686 --> 00:10:44.270
Hello?

66
00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:48.983
OK. yes.

67
00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:51.486
OK. you got her to the orphanage.
Good.

68
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.987
Elisa's fine.

69
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.783
Oh. God.
No. I'm just glad you're OK.

70
00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:59.536
Listen. I want you to be smart. OK?

71
00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.413
I want you to call me
every other hour from the road.

72
00:11:01.496 --> 00:11:03.122
Actually. call me every hour.

73
00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:07.460
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

74
00:11:07.544 --> 00:11:09.421
I love you. too.

75
00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:11.798
I'm proud of you. Bye.

76
00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:18.846
<i>Now that I knew Connie was safe.
I could focus on César Gaviria.</i>

77
00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:24.269
<i>At the time. the only thing more dangerous
than being a Colombian cop</i>

78
00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:27.021
<i>was being a Colombian
presidential candidate.</i>

79
00:11:45.373 --> 00:11:46.708
Mm-hm.

80
00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:49.877
<i>Gaviria had come out
in favor of extraditing the narcos</i>

81
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:54.633
<i>to the United States. and it was in our
best interest that he win the presidency.</i>

82
00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:56.008
<i>- But to win...</i>
- Gracias.

83
00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:58.177
<i>...he had to survive until election day.</i>

84
00:11:58.261 --> 00:11:59.846
Uh. Señor Gaviria?

85
00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:01.514
Through that door.

86
00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:10.565
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.

87
00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:11.733
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

88
00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:15.320
I'm Eduardo Sandoval.
head of security of Dr. Gaviria.

89
00:12:15.403 --> 00:12:16.446
What can we do for you?

90
00:12:16.529 --> 00:12:19.449
I'm hoping that our agency
can offer some resources

91
00:12:19.532 --> 00:12:22.452
to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.

92
00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:26.914
Shouldn't the DEA be out
chasing traffickers or is just my thought?

93
00:12:26.998 --> 00:12:29.793
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.

94
00:12:30.502 --> 00:12:32.128
- Pleasure. sir.
- The pleasure is mine.

95
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:34.088
Please. have a seat.

96
00:12:38.844 --> 00:12:43.765
Your Secret Service
has briefed us on security measures.

97
00:12:43.849 --> 00:12:48.019
No open-air speaking engagements.
different routes home every day.

98
00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:52.273
As if. after the deaths of Lara and Galán.
we needed an education on these things.

99
00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:53.608
- Come on.
- Exactly.

100
00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:55.234
These men will stop at nothing
to kill you.

101
00:12:55.443 --> 00:12:59.698
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.

102
00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:03.951
Your government even offers
the use of an armored Cadillac limousine.

103
00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:05.871
built for your president.

104
00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:09.624
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá
with an American-made tank

105
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:12.293
won't exactly endear us to the voters.

106
00:13:13.002 --> 00:13:18.257
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.

107
00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:21.845
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy.
I'd say thank you.

108
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.932
Well. thank you.

109
00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:27.016
And this?

110
00:13:29.602 --> 00:13:31.771
What are we supposed to do with this?

111
00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:35.233
Bullet-proof pants.

112
00:13:36.484 --> 00:13:38.486
I suggest that you wear them.

113
00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:43.825
Thank you. Agent Murphy.
for your consideration.

114
00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:46.327
And we'll keep in mind your advice.

115
00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:49.873
Thank you for your time.

116
00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:58.423
<i>César Gaviria was riding
a wave of public support</i>

117
00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:01.467
<i>for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.</i>

118
00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:07.223
<i>But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha.</i>

119
00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:10.852
<i>who we tracked to Cartagena
through one of our informants.</i>

120
00:18:08.673 --> 00:18:10.591
What do we got?

121
00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:14.512
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.

122
00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:27.150
Who's this guy?

123
00:18:27.233 --> 00:18:29.610
I don't know. but if Poison
showed his face to pick him up.

124
00:18:29.694 --> 00:18:31.320
he must be really important.

125
00:20:36.237 --> 00:20:38.530
<i>Gaviria's life was on the line...</i>

126
00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.659
<i>my wife was with Colombia's
most wanted fugitive.</i>

127
00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:44.120
<i>and my partner was in Cartagena.</i>

128
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.081
<i>He had his own mission.
with a group of cops</i>

129
00:20:47.165 --> 00:20:51.336
<i>who had seen their friends and relatives
die at the hands of Gacha.</i>

130
00:20:52.795 --> 00:20:56.966
<i>Like Trujillo.
whose father and two brothers. all cops.</i>

131
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:59.551
<i>had died in gun battles with the cartel.</i>

132
00:21:03.222 --> 00:21:08.269
<i>As hard as we were going after Gacha.
the narcos wanted Gaviria.</i>

133
00:21:13.983 --> 00:21:16.819
<i>It killed me to ask for help
from this guy.</i>

134
00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:20.698
<i>Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish.
with none of the charm.</i>

135
00:21:25.703 --> 00:21:27.372
You don't call. you don't write.

136
00:21:36.172 --> 00:21:38.132
I need to know who this is.

137
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.446
The fuck back! Fuck back.

138
00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:02.614
OK.

139
00:22:09.747 --> 00:22:14.043
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me? Gonna speak? Yeah...

140
00:22:14.252 --> 00:22:18.923
<i>Suárez knew exactly who
this guy was. and he wasn't the only one.</i>

141
00:22:20.132 --> 00:22:22.801
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody.

142
00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:23.969
take 'em on a date.

143
00:22:24.053 --> 00:22:25.471
What's going on?

144
00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:27.306
I have reason to believe
the Medellín cartel

145
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.600
is planning an imminent attack
against Gaviria.

146
00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:31.018
We have no intel to that effect.

147
00:22:31.102 --> 00:22:34.897
Maybe you should do your job instead
of spying on other agency personnel.

148
00:22:35.773 --> 00:22:39.360
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing. Ambassador.

149
00:22:39.444 --> 00:22:41.612
CIA's been so kind
to give us these documents.

150
00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:45.032
but 90 percent of them
are too classified for us to read.

151
00:22:45.241 --> 00:22:47.410
I need to get into the White Room.

152
00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:48.994
What's that?

153
00:22:49.203 --> 00:22:50.913
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.

154
00:22:50.996 --> 00:22:54.500
You've been reading too many spy novels.

155
00:22:55.876 --> 00:22:58.754
Spy novels...
Have you read <i>The Spaniard?</i>

156
00:23:00.172 --> 00:23:01.673
Where the hell did you get that?

157
00:23:01.757 --> 00:23:03.592
Ma'am. he has been in the country
for several days.

158
00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:06.512
He's been escorted
by one of Pablo's top sicarios.

159
00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:07.596
Let me see this.

160
00:23:08.431 --> 00:23:11.350
I know the CIA has intel on this man.

161
00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:16.897
Now. are you going
to give me access or not?

162
00:23:21.193 --> 00:23:23.362
Technically. the room isn't white.

163
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.073
It's more of a... burgundy.

164
00:23:32.497 --> 00:23:35.582
- Agent Schroeder. will you join us?
- Mm-hm.

165
00:23:37.626 --> 00:23:40.338
<i>The White Room
was a top secret repository</i>

166
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:43.757
<i>for the CIA's deepest.
darkest secrets.</i>

167
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:48.012
<i>So secret. in fact. that its
very existence was never acknowledged.</i>

168
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.978
Sit here.

169
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.940
Agent Schroeder
will watch you the entire time.

170
00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.651
Where are the files?

171
00:26:59.495 --> 00:27:03.040
<i>Gacha was always paranoid
when things were quiet.</i>

172
00:27:03.123 --> 00:27:06.377
<i>And now. he began to wonder
about Navegante.</i>

173
00:28:12.317 --> 00:28:15.738
<i>The Spaniard was a name
that got everyone's attention.</i>

174
00:28:15.821 --> 00:28:17.864
<i>He was a member of ETA.</i>

175
00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:19.950
<i>Never heard of 'em?</i>

176
00:28:20.158 --> 00:28:22.869
<i>They made bomb-making
a goddamn art form.</i>

177
00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:30.294
<i>They were a group of supposed
freedom fighters from the Basque country.</i>

178
00:28:30.377 --> 00:28:32.379
<i>trying to secede from Spain.</i>

179
00:28:33.756 --> 00:28:37.384
<i>Their specialty was
targeted assassinations of public figures.</i>

180
00:28:40.095 --> 00:28:44.891
<i>ETA was responsible for the assassination
of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco.</i>

181
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.269
<i>returning home from Christmas Mass...</i>

182
00:28:49.104 --> 00:28:54.359
<i>and a remote-controlled car bomb that
killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.</i>

183
00:28:56.903 --> 00:29:00.449
<i>The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.</i>

184
00:29:01.325 --> 00:29:06.455
<i>Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez.
a celebrity now. for hire.</i>

185
00:29:06.538 --> 00:29:08.624
<i>Expensive. but the best.</i>

186
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:12.127
<i>'Cause Pablo only hires the best.</i>

187
00:29:20.886 --> 00:29:24.389
<i>That was Pablo's plan.
to blow up Gaviria.</i>

188
00:29:24.473 --> 00:29:28.686
<i>The question was.
where. when and how?</i>

189
00:29:29.728 --> 00:29:32.898
I appreciate your concern.
Madam Ambassador.

190
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:36.902
but canceling our campaign travel
is not an option.

191
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.906
Well. given the new information
that Agent Murphy has uncovered.

192
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:42.741
I hope you'll reconsider.

193
00:29:43.617 --> 00:29:47.037
He has appearances in Cali. Boyacá.
and a dozen other cities.

194
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.955
You are a target in every one.

195
00:29:49.164 --> 00:29:53.627
Yes. and... we've done everything
your Secret Service

196
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:56.672
and Spain's Civil Guard
have recommended.

197
00:29:56.755 --> 00:30:00.885
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs
at every campaign stop. so...

198
00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:01.927
I think we're good.

199
00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:04.388
You think the Spaniard
doesn't know that?

200
00:30:06.056 --> 00:30:07.850
Yes. I know.

201
00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:10.811
But tell me. Agent Murphy.
how do you expect him to win the election

202
00:30:10.895 --> 00:30:13.898
if he hides like a scared rabbit
behind all this violence?

203
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.566
Tell me. how?

204
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:18.151
How do you expect him to win
if he's dead?

205
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.905
I'm not telling your wife
you died on my watch.

206
00:30:21.112 --> 00:30:23.240
This is not your watch. OK?

207
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.038
Thank you. Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.

208
00:30:31.456 --> 00:30:33.291
I'll take my chances.

209
00:32:52.263 --> 00:32:53.473
Uh-huh.

210
00:36:27.604 --> 00:36:30.107
<i>"Tu puerta"?</i>

211
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.067
- "Door."
- Door.

212
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.861
Suárez! Suárez.

213
00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:50.252
Suárez!

214
00:36:50.335 --> 00:36:52.712
Talk to me. you bastard.
Suárez. hello?

215
00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.257
Hello?

216
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.424
Hel...

217
00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:00.428
- I want that call.
- Right away. sir.

218
00:37:06.935 --> 00:37:10.814
<i>Carrillo and his men
arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.</i>

219
00:37:10.897 --> 00:37:13.483
<i>And Peña still hoped
he could be taken alive.</i>

220
00:42:55.575 --> 00:42:58.161
What are you gonna do?!
Asshole!

221
00:43:43.707 --> 00:43:45.625
I'll sleep tonight.

222
00:43:51.172 --> 00:43:55.552
<i>This was the first successful
major operation by the Search Bloc.</i>

223
00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:57.803
<i>It signaled to the country
and to the world</i>

224
00:43:57.887 --> 00:44:01.224
<i>that the fight against the narcos
had moved to a new level.</i>

225
00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:20.702
Dr. Gaviria!

226
00:44:27.542 --> 00:44:30.211
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?

227
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.173
- No. no. He can't go. no.
- What?

228
00:44:34.257 --> 00:44:38.886
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes. he dies.

229
00:44:38.969 --> 00:44:40.930
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
What are you talking about?

230
00:44:41.138 --> 00:44:45.893
This is your job. your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.

231
00:44:45.976 --> 00:44:47.562
Do you have proof?

232
00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:51.315
I got my gut.

233
00:44:51.399 --> 00:44:53.067
You got your gut.

234
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:59.240
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.

235
00:44:59.449 --> 00:45:01.409
What if I'm right?

236
00:46:23.115 --> 00:46:25.159
I'll follow your gut this time.

237
00:46:31.415 --> 00:46:36.962
Well... it seems like
you and I are not the only ones afraid.
