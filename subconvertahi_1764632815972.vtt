Whoa. you gonna hit me with that?

343
00:15:50.077 --> 00:15:51.078
What?

344
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:52.245
Oh. no! I'm sorry.

345
00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:53.956
I'd never.
Uh. I know better.

346
00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:57.793
I grew up across
from your family's dry cleaners.

347
00:15:57.876 --> 00:15:59.461
Oh. no shit? You're from Flatbush?

Maybe.

00:16:14.101 --> 00:16:15.102
Mm.

354
00:16:16.561 --> 00:16:18.689
-What's going on?
-I'm retiring.

355
00:16:18.772 --> 00:16:20.816
Which means we're gonna need
someone new on the desk

356
00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:23.902
and someone new
to help with Mr. Caccimelio.

357
00:16:23.986 --> 00:16:25.570
I know you need the money.

358
00:16:25.654 --> 00:16:27.489
And I know you love the building.

359
00:16:28.365 --> 00:16:30.867
Consider this your big break.

360
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:33.286
-Wait. are you serious?
-Mm-hmm.

361
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.371

-Whoa. whoa. whoa. take it easy.

Nothin' like that. okay?

365

N-Not all the work is legal per se.
but nobody's gettin' hurt.

366
00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:47.467
I got a place here in the Arconia.

367

A little business
on Saturday night.

368
00:16:49.386 --> 00:16:51.388
All you need to do is stay a little later.

369
00:16:51.471 --> 00:16:54.224

at letting people in.

373

Right. That's right.
