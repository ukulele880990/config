00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.969
It's an astrology thing.
It's called The Cycle.

while you're eating eggs

is trying to teach you

536

in a healthier way.

537

-Can I have some salt?
-Really?

546
00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:48.635
Yeah. It needs it.

547
00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.387

Yeah. so two years
of training for nothing.

568
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:36.016

Um... [stutters] Well.
I'm just... I'm just trying

574
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:53.116

don't know what the fuck
I'm doing. [chuckles]

580

You know. Vic here

what the fuck he's doing.

582

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:10.800
No. What's the big deal?
I'm just asking questions.

585
00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.636
I like our new friend
Frida here.

586
00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.471
I think she's cool
and interesting.

587
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:15.597
I just want to get to know
her better. that's all.

there was something wrong
with this place.

It's just. like.
I feel like I would know

any sense. but...

we're forgetting.
like. a lot of stuff.

1015

Yeah?

1017
00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:36.974

1022
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.362
Huh?

1023
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:53.615
Do you know what day it is?

1024
00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:56.743
No.

1025
00:49:59.204 --> 00:50:01.248
But. like. I never know
what day it is.

1026
00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:03.583
Right.

1027
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:07.004
I'm having a great time here.

1028
00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:13.093
But I also have this

1029
00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:15.595
feeling that I'm. like...

1030
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.558
not.

1031
00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:24.104
-Does that make sense?
-Yes.

1032
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:25.564
I have dirt under my nails.

1033
00:50:25.605 --> 00:50:26.773
and I don't know
how it got there.

1034
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:30.068
[Sarah] I'm sorry.
What is this?

1035
00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.821
What is that?

1036
00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:34.740
They were like... [mimicking]
"Oh. Sarah...

1037
00:50:34.781 --> 00:50:36.700
you were climbing up a tree
and you were so wasted.

1038
00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:38.201
you fell."
[in normal voice] Uh-mmm.

1039
00:50:38.243 --> 00:50:39.870
I didn't last eight seasons

1040
00:50:39.911 --> 00:50:41.872
on Hot Survivor Babes
because I fell.

1041
00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:43.582
So you don't think I'm crazy?

1042
00:50:43.623 --> 00:50:46.209
What's crazy is that
we got onto a plane

1043
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.670
with a bunch of dudes
we don't know.

1044
00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.297
I thought
you all knew each other.

1045
00:50:50.338 --> 00:50:51.465
No.

1046
00:50:54.968 --> 00:50:57.971
Cody just chatted me up
at a coffee shop.

1047
00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:00.348
just talking about
how he knew Slater King.

1048
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.350
[stutters]
But Heather and Camilla.

1049
00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:03.477
they know everybody. right?

1050
00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:06.897
I don't know.

1051
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:16.782
Oh. my God!

1052
00:51:16.823 --> 00:51:18.158
What the fuck
were we thinking?

1053
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.451
-Oh. fuck!
-I knew it!

1054
00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:20.702
I knew it!

1055
00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:22.287
I knew it! I knew it!

1056
00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:23.955
I knew it was
too good to be true.

1057
00:51:23.997 --> 00:51:25.290
Of course they're fucking
with our heads

1058
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:27.167
because that's what they do.

1059
00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:29.961
They distract us with
these cute little outfits.

1060
00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:33.757
and they shower us with
raspberries and champagne.

1061
00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:35.175
But you know what?

1062
00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:37.052
We know
what's really going on.

1063
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.429
They are trying to control us.

1064
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:42.307
They're trying
to make us look crazy.

1065
00:51:49.022 --> 00:51:50.107
And it's working.

1066
00:51:55.195 --> 00:51:56.822
So they're making us forget.

1067
00:51:57.697 --> 00:51:58.824
Yeah.

1068
00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.033
Okay. but like...

1069
00:52:00.867 --> 00:52:01.952
how?

1070
00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:08.416
"Forgetting is a gift."

1071
00:52:10.418 --> 00:52:11.962
Huh?

1072
00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:14.840
Slater said.
"Forgetting is a gift."

1073
00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:17.008
Oh...

1074
00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:21.930
I don't get it.

1075
00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:24.057
[ominous music playing]

1076
00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:32.899
We need to call the cops.

1077
00:52:32.941 --> 00:52:34.442
Yes.

1078
00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.986
-We need to call the FBI.
-Yes.

1079
00:52:36.027 --> 00:52:38.071
We need to call the cops
and the FBI.

1080
00:52:38.113 --> 00:52:39.281
Okay. but wait.

1081
00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.408
-What?
-Wait. wait.

1082
00:52:41.449 --> 00:52:42.826
Say we call the cops
and the FBI. right?

1083
00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:44.578
Uh-huh...

1084
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:46.746
And we're. like.
"Hi. Hello. Please send help.

1085
00:52:46.788 --> 00:52:48.290
"Slater King and his buddies

1086
00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.167
are doing
horrible things to us."

1087
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:51.585
They're gonna be like.
"What did they do?"

1088
00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:54.045
And we're gonna be like.
"Um...

1089
00:52:54.796 --> 00:52:56.548
We don't know."

1090
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.008
"'Cause they've been
secretly erasing memories

1091
00:52:58.049 --> 00:53:00.135
-with perfume. I guess."
-[gulps]

1092
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.304
And the guys
would be like. "What?"

1093
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:03.972
"We would never do that.

1094
00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:05.557
other white guys
we probably play golf with."

1095
00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:06.683
And Heather and Camilla
will be like.

1096
00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:08.435
"Nothing but good times

1097
00:53:08.476 --> 00:53:10.270
and fat fucking blunts
over here. officer."

1098
00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:12.647
And I'll be like.
"Come on. guys. believe women."

1099
00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.316
"Here is my friend's lighter."

1100
00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.067
And they'll be like.
"Sure thing. Of course."

1101
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:17.903
"You crazy fucking bitch."
[breath trembling]

1102
00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.198
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1103
00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:22.699
-Look at me.
-[softly] Okay.

1104
00:53:22.741 --> 00:53:24.075
-Let's get on the same page.
-Okay.

1105
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.493
Your friend. you remember her?

1106
00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:26.411
[in normal voice] Yes.

1107
00:53:27.412 --> 00:53:29.623
-But I don't remember her.
-No.

1108
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:33.210
-What's up with that?
-[exhales]

1109
00:53:36.338 --> 00:53:37.631
She got bit by a snake.

1110
00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:41.259
-Okay?
-[drawer opens and closes]

1111
00:53:42.802 --> 00:53:44.095
And I drank this.

1112
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:46.640
What's in there?

1113
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:47.933
I'm pretty sure
it's snake venom.

1114
00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:52.187
You think snake venom's
gonna make us remember?

1115
00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.730
Yeah.

1116
00:53:55.523 --> 00:53:56.650
Fuck it.

-Oh. that's... That's venom?

1119
00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:07.577
-Yeah. dude.
-Why didn't you warn me?

1120
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:09.496
-I did.
-That is disgusting.

1121
00:54:09.537 --> 00:54:11.957
How are we gonna get Heather
and Camilla to drink that?

1122
00:54:11.998 --> 00:54:13.875
Oh. man. [sniffs]

1123

Slam it. girlfriends.

I thought last year

1783
01:26:58.838 --> 01:27:01.257
but you've really
outdone yourself.

[laughing]

1785
01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:07.764
So...

1789
01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.983
there is a version of this
where we're all just

That's right.

1828

There is no forgiveness.

1829
01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.092
There's just

1830
01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:09.385
forgetting.

1831
01:29:10.219 --> 01:29:11.554

That's amazing.

1835
01:29:20.563 --> 01:29:22.065
Imagine what humans could be

1836
01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:25.109
capable of if we could
free them

1837
01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:28.613
from the suffering
and the pain of their trauma.

1838
01:29:28.654 --> 01:29:31.783
Oh. my God. my sister.
my sister would be...

she'd be free.

1840
01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:35.161
She'd be free
'cause she's so fucked up.

1841
01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.996
because she remembers
everything.

1842

She remembers every
single thing. She's. like...

"How could you go and
play tennis with that man

after what he did to us
when we were little?"
