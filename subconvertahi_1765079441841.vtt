00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.154
<i>On Capitol Hill today.</i>

3
00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:32.073
{\an8}a bipartisan call for more
government transparency on UFOs.

4
00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:35.953
{\an8}or as the military calls them.
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. UAPs.

5
00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:41.458
{\an8}The objects have been detected
essentially where all operations.

6
00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:43.918
{\an8}Navy operations are being
conducted across the world.

7
00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:46.880
{\an8}The technology
that we faced was far superior

8
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.509
{\an8}than anything we have currently
or we're gonna have in the next 20 years.

9
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:57.348
{\an8}Unidentified aerial phenomena
are a potential national security threat

10
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.225
{\an8}and they need to be treated that way.

11
00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.979
<i>United States government
has gathered a great deal of information</i>

12
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.482
<i>about UAPs over many decades.</i>

13
00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:08.401
but has refused to share it
with the American people.

14
00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.781
That is wrong. and additionally.
it breeds mistrust.

15
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.922
I spent 11 years in the US Navy
as a fighter pilot.

16
00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:31.466
For 18 years.
I flew fighters for the US Navy.

17
00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:34.385
I spent 20 years working
in the US intelligence community.

18
00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.514
I served as the fourth
Director of National Intelligence.

19
00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.850
I spent 25 years
as a senior official with the CIA.

20
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.562
I retired from the Navy as a one-star
admiral after 32 years of service.

21
00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:49.859
I worked on highly classified UAP programs
for the government as a senior scientist.

22
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.904
I spent 32 years in and out
of government in national security.

23
00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:58.117
I've worked 28 years as an astrophysicist
on highly classified UAP programs

24
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.246
for the United States government
and for the defense industry.

25
00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:03.248
I'm a professor
in the department of pathology

26
00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.375
at Stanford University School of Medicine.

27
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:07.710
And for the last ten years or so.

28
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.088
I've been working
with the Department of Defense

29
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.049
and people in the CIA on the UAP topic.

30
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.136
I've come to the conclusion that
we are not only not alone in the universe.

31
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.763
but we have been discovered

32
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:21.766
by an intelligence
from some other part of the universe.

33
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.476
There's evidence we are not alone.

34
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:27.230
Humanity is not the only
intelligent species in the universe.

35
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.857
We're not alone in the universe.

36
00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.817
I wouldn't be so arrogant to suggest

37
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:34.028
there are no other
forms of life out there.

38
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.698
Humanity is not the only intelligence
in the universe.

39
00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.368
UAPs are real.
They're here and they're not human.

40
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:45.582
There are other intelligences
that have highly advanced exotic craft

41
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:49.586
interacting with the human population.

42
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:53.423
They are here. This is real.
It's happening. It's happening now.

43
00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:55.425
Non-human intelligence exists.

44
00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:57.218
It's been interacting with humanity

45
00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.054
and it's been doing so
on this planet for a long time.

46
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.473
We are not the only intelligent
life form in the universe.

47
00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.102
There's something here on the planet
with us that is intelligent

48
00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:07.770
and more intelligent than us.

49
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:11.442
This is the biggest discovery
in human history.

50
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.297
<i>My name is Lue Elizondo.
In 2009. my life changed forever.</i>

51
00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:38.509
{\an8}That's when I was recruited into
a highly sensitive government program

52
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.889
that investigated
Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. UAP.

53
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.100
also commonly known as UFOs.

54
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.269
<i>My work for the US government goes back</i>

55
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.731
<i>almost 30 years
to when I joined the US Army.</i>

56
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.483
<i>From there. I had the good fortune</i>

57
00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:57.111
<i>of being recruited into various programs
within military intelligence.</i>

58
00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.988
<i>During my career. I served my country</i>

59
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.407
<i>around the world.
managing and directing missions.</i>

60
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.701
<i>including counter-narcotics.
counter-espionage.</i>

61
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.412
<i>counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency.</i>

62
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.415
And it was later in my career
that I actually began running

63
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.668
special access programs
for the US government.

64
00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.045
<i>and in some cases reported
directly to the White House</i>

65
00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:16.006
<i>and the National Security Council.</i>

66
00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.549
{\an8}My name is Jay Stratton.

67
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.970
{\an8}and for over 16 years
on behalf of the US government.

68
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.183
{\an8}I worked as a senior intelligence official
on the UAP topic.

69
00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.770
<i>I joined the Army at the age of 17
and left for a career</i>

70
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:33.439
<i>in military intelligence
with eight combat deployments.</i>

71
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.067
<i>including Iraq and Afghanistan.</i>

72
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.695
<i>After the Army.
I joined Naval Intelligence.</i>

73
00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:41.656
<i>and then I transitioned
to the Defense Intelligence Agency.</i>

74
00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:43.908
where I was the chief
of air and space warfare

75
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.576
inside of the Defense Warning office.

76
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:49.455
It was at the DIA that my colleagues
and I started getting reports

77
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.374
of what are now called UAP.

78
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:54.794
{\an8}<i>We went all over the government.
pentagon. every intelligence agency.</i>

79
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:59.215
anywhere we could think to try to find
the UAP program. assuming there was one.

80
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.633
As far as we could tell.

81
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.761
no one in the United States government
had a UAP program.

82
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.848
so my colleagues and I
began a new program.

83
00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.641
which ultimately became AATIP.

84
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:13.272
{\an8}The Advanced Aerospace
Threat Identification Program. AATIP.

85
00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:16.816
<i>The funding
for this effort was sponsored by</i>

86
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:20.070
<i>then Senate majority leader
Senator Harry Reid.</i>

87
00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:24.407
And together myself.
Jay Stratton and our team

88
00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:29.203
for nearly a decade investigated
UAP incidents around the world.

89
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.414
Based on hard evidence and data.

90
00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:36.419
we learned that UAPs
present serious national security concerns

91
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.173
and a potential existential threat.

92
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:43.634
<i>Simply put. transmedium crafts.</i>

93
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:49.808
<i>vehicles that have the capability
to operate in space. air.</i>

94
00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:56.022
<i>and water. and seemingly defy
all that humanity knows about physics</i>

95
00:05:56.023 --> 00:06:01.570
<i>have been operating with complete impunity
around the world since at least the 1940s.</i>

96
00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:07.950
At AATIP. we had access
to some of the most sensitive videos

97
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.952
in the Department of Defense inventory.

98
00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:14.707
If you could be in my shoes and see what
I've seen. and folks like Jay Stratton.

99
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:19.170
there would be zero shadow of a doubt
that these things are real

100
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:20.838
and they are not made by humans.

101
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.800
The things that I've seen.
the clearest videos.

102
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:25.343
the best evidence that we have

103
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:28.596
that these are non-human intelligence
remain classified.

104
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.516
{\an8}The classified data that we had access to

105
00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:34.393
{\an8}when we joined the program
was indisputable.

106
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.606
There's 80 years of this data
that the public isn't even aware of.

107
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:43.278
I have seen with my own eyes
non-human craft and non-human beings.

108
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.157
{\an8}For 23 years and ten months.

109
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.452
{\an8}I was in the United States Air Force
as an A-10 pilot.

110
00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.080
{\an8}<i>And while I was at NORAD.</i>

111
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.543
<i>I witnessed an event
that I will remember forever.</i>

112
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.171
<i>There was a unknown object
we were tracking on radars.</i>

113
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.758
And the commander says.
"I want that target."

114
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.677
That means intercept it.

115
00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:12.557
<i>Fighters all the way down
the eastern seaboard were scrambled.</i>

116
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:17.770
and none of the fighters were successful
in intercepting or running it down.

117
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:22.776
{\an8}We were unable to maintain
air sovereignty over North America.

118
00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:31.784
{\an8}On November 14th. 2004.
we were onboard the USS Nimitz.

119
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.620
{\an8}which is a nuclear aircraft carrier.

120
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.249
<i>I was the most senior person
in the squadron flying.</i>

121
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.959
<i>I had launched off Nimitz to do</i>

122
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.714
<i>an air defense exercise
off the coast of San Diego. California.</i>

123
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.468
And I ended up chasing a UAP
known as the Tic Tac UAP.

124
00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:53.598
<i>It was about 40 feet long
and just sitting there in space.</i>

125
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:57.768
You can see it start to accelerate.
And as it gets in front of us. it's gone.

126
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.688
This thing was doing 32.000 miles an hour.

127
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:04.025
so obviously that technology
is not the United States.

128
00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:07.695
{\an8} <i>As we were
watching this Tic Tac object</i>

129
00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.865
<i>maneuver in this bizarre way.</i>

130
00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:12.992
<i>it was obvious
that it wasn't conventional.</i>

131
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:17.330
{\an8}This was defying those laws of physics.

132
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:21.500
{\an8}laws of gravity
that as pilots we live and die by.

133
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:26.714
We literally had these things
stalking Navy vessels on deployment.

134
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:30.635
The frequency in which UAP were
being reported to us was increasing.

135
00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:33.555
{\an8}They were ubiquitous.
We were seeing them nearly daily.

136
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.560
<i>My gosh. there's a whole
fleet of 'em. Look on the SA!</i>

137
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.813
And then we actually almost
had a midair with one of these objects.

138
00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.191
<i>This now became a safety issue.</i>

139
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:48.986
Two aircraft from my squadron were
flying in close proximity to each other

140
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:52.073
in section formation.
so about 150 feet apart or so.

141
00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:55.076
<i>One of these objects went right
in between those two aircraft.</i>

142
00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.286
right past the lead aircraft.

143
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.914
The lead aircraft
was visually able to see the object.

144
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:04.253
and he simply described it as a dark gray
or a black cube inside of a clear sphere.

145
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.214
To be clear.

146
00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:12.760
non-human intelligence
has been actively conducting

147
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.264
ISR. Intelligence.
Surveillance and Reconnaissance

148
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:21.687
of some of our most sensitive
US military facilities and nuclear sites.

149
00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:26.732
They have both deactivated
and activated nuclear weapons

150
00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.693
with both the United States and Russia.

151
00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:34.073
The nuclear weapons that were
activated in Russia were pointed at us.

152
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:39.203
and from that perspective.
the stakes really could not be any higher.

153
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.998
This is an emerging
and disruptive threat for the US

154
00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:44.292
and truly a national security concern.

155
00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:47.336
By the way. this isn't just
happening here in the US.

156
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.841
It's happening all over the world
and occurring with greater frequency.

157
00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.971
<i>When I met Lue Elizondo in the Pentagon.</i>

158
00:09:56.972 --> 00:10:01.892
<i>he made me aware not only
that this phenomenon was real.</i>

159
00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:06.814
<i>but it was an ongoing
persistent phenomenon.</i>

160
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.066
{\an8}The Secretary of Defense didn't know.
the Congress didn't know.

161
00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.110
{\an8}senior policymakers didn't know.

162
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:15.781
{\an8}and nobody was doing anything
about it other than Lue

163
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.700
and a handful of colleagues.

164
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.453
I was shocked and I was stunned.

165
00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:23.622
and immediately was concerned about

166
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.417
intelligence failures
that have occurred in the past

167
00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.169
and the disasters that have ensued.

168
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.173
<i>and determined immediately
to do whatever I could to help get Lue</i>

169
00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:35.343
{\an8}<i>to the Secretary of Defense
to move that information forward.</i>

170
00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:39.430
{\an8}Each time Jay and I and others tried
to raise the alarm bells

171
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:42.725
and bring this issue
up to the appropriate level.

172
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.019
we were met with fierce resistance.

173
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.897
The stigma alone
and the taboo of the topic.

174
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:52.068
the historical association of "UFOs"
was something that

175
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:56.947
for most people in leadership positions
was too big of a pill to swallow.

176
00:10:56.948 --> 00:11:02.161
In fact. the stigma was so strong
that people either believed. A.

177
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.748
the topic wasn't real. or B.

178
00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:09.210
the stigma was going to somehow
taint or tarnish their career.

179
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.628
so they didn't want to touch it.

180
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:13.714
{\an8}We couldn't get the leadership
in the Pentagon

181
00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.300
{\an8}to look at the actual scientific data

182
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:20.054
that showed that there is
a strong national security threat.

183
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:23.182
They were more worried about
the impact on their reputation

184
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.227
than they were about
the safety of the nation.

185
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.104
<i>On top of that.</i>

186
00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:31.607
<i>we were shocked to find we were getting
pushback from people in the Pentagon</i>

187
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.026
<i>based on their religious beliefs.</i>

188
00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:37.780
There really were religious fundamentalist
extremists with in the Pentagon

189
00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:41.409
that had a severe adversity to this topic.

190
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.244
These are national security experts.

191
00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:45.246
senior members of the national
intelligence community

192
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:47.498
who are putting their religion
above national security.

193
00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:52.294
A senior DOD official actually stopped me
in the hallways in the Pentagon

194
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.630
and told me
that we were doing the devil's work.

195
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.883
I had to deal with people who were
senior to me who were telling me

196
00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:02.054
in their world that these are demons.
and we are poking demons

197
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.057
and messing in Satan's world
and all these other things.

198
00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.227
I was like. "I can't believe
this is coming out of your mouth."

199
00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:12.773
I'm briefing about an advanced
aerospace vehicle that has been detected

200
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.651
<i>on multiple sensors
that's absolutely there.</i>

201
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.903
and you're telling me
that you think these are demons

202
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.239
and we shouldn't
look at them and study them.

203
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.575
My mind was blown.

204
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.454
<i>While we were trying
to overcome all of these hurdles.</i>

205
00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:30.375
<i>we discovered another deeply hidden
and much larger UAP program.</i>

206
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.588
This program was so sensitive

207
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:42.178
that it was withheld from
the Secretary of Defense. Congress.

208
00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:45.681
and even
the President of the United States.

209
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:49.560
This program is referred to as
"The Legacy Program."

210
00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:51.729
This program had been capturing.

211
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:57.776
retrieving and reverse engineering UAPs
since at least 1947.

212
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.695
On numerous occasions.

213
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:04.825
these retrievals included
the bodies of non-humans.

214
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:09.663
some sort of intelligence.
intelligent being that is not human.

215
00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.166
When Jay and I began knocking on doors

216
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.668
and trying to get access
into the Legacy Program.

217
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:18.839
there was this almost
like an immune response

218
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.426
by the Legacy Program.
and antibodies came out of everywhere

219
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.969
to try to shut us down.

220
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.516
{\an8}We began communicating with scientists
involved in the Legacy Program.

221
00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:31.936
{\an8}but their leaders when they learned
of this. shut it down aggressively.

222
00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:35.940
Not only were we met with
fierce resistance and stonewalling.

223
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:40.277
we actually had people angry at us that
we're even asking the question itself.

224
00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:45.074
as in. you know. what right do we have
to inquire about the Legacy Program.

225
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.117
despite the fact we were running AATIP.

226
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.577
Put yourself in my shoes.

227
00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:52.122
I'm conducting investigations
of ongoing UAP activity

228
00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.709
and there's this Legacy Program
that has at least 80 years of information

229
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.128
that could help us
better understand this problem

230
00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:01.258
and protect national security.
and they refuse to give it to us.

231
00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:08.806
When it became clear that
we couldn't work through the system.

232
00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:13.227
I knew from experience having worked
with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

233
00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:16.021
what it takes to move this oil tanker.

234
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:22.987
Think about this immense.
immense ship that has massive inertia.

235
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.322
and you're trying
to get it to change course.

236
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.408
When it comes
to the Department of Defense.

237
00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:31.829
only Congress
has the wherewithal to do that.

238
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:37.209
And the way to get Congress's attention
is first and foremost through the press.

239
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.256
I knew we had to get the press engaged
to help get the Hill engaged.

240
00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:46.635
to then get back to changing
the Defense Department

241
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.930
to study this problem
to figure out is there a threat?

242
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.641
Where are these things coming from
and how do they work?

243
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.728
As government employees.
we're not allowed to talk to the media.

244
00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.523
<i>so Lue and I strategized
on how to overcome this hurdle.</i>

245
00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:03.027
There were really only two choices.

246
00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:06.030
The first choice was
make peace with silence

247
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.949
and sit on
what is humanity's greatest secret.

248
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.661
<i>all the while keeping
Americans in the dark.</i>

249
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.874
<i>Or two. I could resign
my position in protest</i>

250
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:20.002
<i>and fulfill my obligations
to the American people</i>

251
00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.672
by telling the truth
about what I know about UAP.

252
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:33.891
There was this difficult moment
where Lue had to decide.

253
00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:36.935
"Do I throw in the towel?
Do we give up on this?"

254
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.896
<i>"Do we ignore this?"</i>

255
00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:41.440
Or does he fall on his sword?

256
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.360
I couldn't. nor would I ever
reveal classified information.

257
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:48.947
but I knew that if I could say
just enough at the unclassified level

258
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:52.534
to make the media aware
and our government officials aware

259
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.286
of the reality of the UAP topic.

260
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:58.165
<i>then Jay hopefully would be able to use
that momentum to go ahead and achieve</i>

261
00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.211
<i>the goals that we set out
to achieve inside the government.</i>

262
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.423
<i>And we had
a number of difficult conversations</i>

263
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:10.010
<i>because Lue is giving up
a very promising career.</i>

264
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:13.932
{\an8}<i>He loved what he was doing.
He was very good at what he was doing.</i>

265
00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:21.856
It's such a profound life decision for Lue
to make for himself and his family.

266
00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:26.318
During one of my routine
hellish commutes back home.

267
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.697
{\an8}<i>as I was stuck in traffic.
looking in front of me and behind me</i>

268
00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:34.535
{\an8}and seeing thousands of cars.
I had this profound sense of isolation.

269
00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:37.621
a feeling I had
never felt before in my life.

270
00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:41.709
a feeling that I was completely alone.

271
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.003
I might as well have been living
on the dark side of the moon.

272
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.589
None of these people around me.

273
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.261
in fact. no one anywhere had any idea

274
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:54.347
of what was <i>actually
going on around them.</i>

275
00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.390
<i>Not a clue.</i>

276
00:16:56.391 --> 00:17:00.519
<i>I thought to myself. these individuals
deserve to know the truth.</i>

277
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.230
the mere fact that we're
not alone in the universe.

278
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:07.985
How can any one organization.
institution. religion. or government

279
00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:11.530
control that
or censor that or gatekeep that?

280
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:16.660
No one has the right
to keep fundamental truths

281
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.789
away from the American people
and humanity.

282
00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:25.043
{\an8} <i>CNN has learned the Pentagon
had a secretive program to research UFOs.</i>

283
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:29.840
{\an8}The existence of a secret government
program to investigate UFO sightings.

284
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:33.552
{\an8}A recent report by the <i>New York Times</i>
unveiled the existence of a real life

285
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.095
X-Files <i>department.</i>

286
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:39.016
<i>their secret government program
to investigate mysterious flying objects.</i>

287
00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:42.686
{\an8}This seems potentially like
one of the biggest stories of my lifetime.

288
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.897
{\an8}These aircraft. we'll call 'em aircraft.

289
00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:48.150
{\an8}are displaying characteristics
that are not currently

290
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:51.988
{\an8}within the US inventory
nor in any foreign inventory.

291
00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.949
<i>Look at that thing. dude. My gosh.</i>

292
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.243
{\an8}This is a very serious
national security issue.

293
00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.497
{\an8}Something is in our skies.
It has been there for quite some time.

294
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.040
{\an8} <i>There's a whole fleet of 'em.</i>

295
00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:05.083
{\an8}You have objects that are doing things.

296
00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:08.170
{\an8}maneuvering in ways
without any obvious sign of propulsion.

297
00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:11.715
{\an8}My submission is that
what we are looking at is truly.

298
00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:16.929
<i>by definition. exotic technologies.
beyond next generation technologies.</i>

299
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.016
{\an8}And the bureaucracy and the Department
of Defense really limited our ability

300
00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.937
{\an8}to keep leadership informed
of what we were seeing.

301
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.235
As soon as the media
started paying attention.

302
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.945
Congress started paying attention.

303
00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.239
and I started getting calls
from the Hill for briefings.

304
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.536
{\an8}Senators received a classified briefing
about UFOs at the Pentagon.

305
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.578
<i>Senator Mark Warner.</i>

306
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.997
<i>the vice chair
of the Intelligence Committee said.</i>

307
00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:48.001
"Look. I think it's important that the
military is taking this more seriously now

308
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.336
than they did in the past."

309
00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:52.589
<i>Senator Rubio and Warner.
to their great credit.</i>

310
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.885
<i>put national security above
their own personal political careers</i>

311
00:18:56.886 --> 00:19:00.764
<i>and took the risk of engaging
publicly on this issue.</i>

312
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.934
{\an8}When they began to engage.
the Defense Department had to admit

313
00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.144
{\an8}to the world that this was real
and it was happening.

314
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:12.235
{\an8}and that immediately took the entire
credibility of the issue up a huge notch.

315
00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:15.988
{\an8}The US Navy has finally acknowledged
that videos appearing to show UFOs flying

316
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.031
{\an8}through the air are real.

317
00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:22.953
{\an8} <i>Commander David Fravor
describing it like a 40 foot long Tic Tac.</i>

318
00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.873
{\an8}The ability to hover over the water
and then start a vertical climb

319
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.834
{\an8}from basically zero
up towards about 12.000 feet

320
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.295
{\an8}and then accelerate
in less than two seconds

321
00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:34.215
{\an8}and disappear is something
I had never seen in my life.

322
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:42.097
{\an8}We've had repeated instances of something
operating in the airspace

323
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.516
{\an8}over restricted nuclear facilities.

324
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.394
{\an8}and it's not ours
and we don't know whose it is.

325
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.646
{\an8}That alone. just that statement alone.

326
00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:53.025
{\an8}deserves inquiry.
deserves attention. deserves focus.

327
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.570
{\an8}If you have objects
in the sky that you cannot identify.

328
00:19:56.571 --> 00:20:00.198
{\an8}that's a problem because
it could be China. it could be Russia.

329
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.825
{\an8}it could be any adversary.

330
00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:06.413
{\an8}Well. any unexplained phenomenon
could pose a national security threat.

331
00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:09.166
{\an8}That's the way
you have to treat those things.

332
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.919
{\an8}There's something violating our airspace.

333
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.504
{\an8}There's something fouling arranges

334
00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:18.717
{\an8}that even the people we've tasked in
the executive branch to understand this

335
00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.178
cannot provide an explanation.

336
00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.389
so I would say in addition
to the national security implications.

337
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.643
this has implications for basic trust
and confidence in the American government.

338
00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.811
{\an8}We don't know
the origin of the phenomenon.

339
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.480
{\an8}and we're gonna try
to get to the bottom of it

340
00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.523
{\an8}because for national defense purposes.

341
00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:35.692
{\an8}some of these have been
in areas that we train.

342
00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:39.196
These have been in areas where
we've got some of our best equipment.

343
00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:42.366
and yet our best equipment
has not been able to tag these things.

344
00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.910
We've not been able
to go in and catch them.

345
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.912
{\an8}No matter what they are.
they're invading our airspace

346
00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.373
{\an8}and we don't know exactly
why they're doing it.

347
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.584
{\an8}what their intent is
and what their capabilities are.

348
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:55.879
In addition
to the national security concerns.

349
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.382
this violation
of all nations' sovereign airspace

350
00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:03.637
presents a safety of flight concern
for all military and civilian aviation.

351
00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:07.307
<i>And the even scarier thing is that
the Federal Aviation Administration</i>

352
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.810
stopped using radar
to track our air travel.

353
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.687
They only track aircraft.

354
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.648
predominantly commercial and civilian.
that are squawking.

355
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.984
so they're actually putting
a signal into the system saying.

356
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.152
"Here's where I am."

357
00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:21.029
<i>The only way they know the UAP are there</i>

358
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.157
<i>is if the pilot sees something
and says something.</i>

359
00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:27.619
The fact that the FAA is not tracking UAP

360
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.914
<i>is putting American lives
at risk every day.</i>

361
00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.207
<i>I'm Brett Feddersen.</i>

362
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:36.670
{\an8}I served as the director of aviation
security on the National Security Council

363
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:40.632
{\an8}and as the acting director for the
Federal Aviation Administration's

364
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.884
<i>National Security Programs Office.</i>

365
00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:44.678
<i>I can say through my experience</i>

366
00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:48.807
that we are absolutely
not alone in this universe.

367
00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:52.602
The biggest thing that concerns me with
UAPs is the national security concern.

368
00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:53.812
It's the unknown.

369
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:56.898
It's the fact that this technology
does stuff that we can't do.

370
00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:59.943
And if we can't figure out
what it is or what it wants.

371
00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.070
uh. or what it's being used for.

372
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:05.532
that keeps me up at night and the idea
that we're behind the power curve.

373
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:09.578
We want to be able to maintain the
cutting edge technology and the advantage

374
00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:13.165
here in the United States
so that we can sleep comfortably at night

375
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:17.210
and feel the safety of what
the American government has provided.

376
00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:20.255
There's sort of. I think.
four hypotheses out there.

377
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:24.885
one of which is that this is
foreign adversary technology

378
00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:27.679
that we simply don't understand
or weren't aware of.

379
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.265
and that would amount to probably
the biggest intelligence failure

380
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:31.767
in modern American history.

381
00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:35.854
The second of which is that this is
a robust counter-intelligence program

382
00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:41.026
to cover up for a US
government effort that has fallen.

383
00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:44.321
kind of. away
from congressional oversight.

384
00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:48.366
A third hypothesis is obviously
that this is. uh. interdimensional

385
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.868
or extra-terrestrial.

386
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:52.789
The fourth could be
a combination of the previous three.

387
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:57.876
Some of the biggest strategic
blunders in human history.

388
00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:00.921
the foundation of those blunders
were a lack of imagination.

389
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:05.092
The belief that an adversary
or whoever could not do something

390
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:06.426
because it had never been done before.

391
00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:09.513
The US thought it was safe
for those ships in Pearl Harbor

392
00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:12.307
because we didn't think
the Japanese could get there.

393
00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:15.811
much less have torpedoes
that could navigate such a narrow straight

394
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:17.772
<i>and hit these ships until they did.</i>

395
00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:21.817
We never thought in our wildest dreams
that terrorists would strike us

396
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:25.821
in the homeland by training
for a year to become pilots

397
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:28.198
<i>and then hijacking commercial aircraft</i>

398
00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:29.991
<i>and crashing them into buildings.
and they did.</i>

399
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:35.956
The thing that keeps me up at night.
something in the human psyche that says.

400
00:23:35.957 --> 00:23:40.335
I don't have time or energy
to sort of prepare for the unforeseen

401
00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:42.212
or what I've never seen done before.

402
00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:45.841
and. um. you know.
that leads to strategic surprise

403
00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:48.802
and sometimes strategic surprises

404
00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:51.889
change the course of human history.

405
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.183
<i>There was
one classified briefing</i>

406
00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:57.602
<i>that I gave to members
of the House and Senate.</i>

407
00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:02.232
where I took military pilots to tell them
the story of their encounters with UAP.

408
00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:05.570
Those stories left them so rattled
that they had trouble sleeping that night.

409
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:09.990
<i>The United States' most
trusted military servicemen and women</i>

410
00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:13.618
<i>and irrefutable data from our
intelligence collection systems</i>

411
00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:16.706
<i>have been observing UAP for decades.</i>

412
00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:20.584
Everything observed can be categorized

413
00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:23.378
by five distinct
performance characteristics.

414
00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:26.507
<i>At AATIP. we call these The Observables.</i>

415
00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:31.679
<i>The first observable
is hypersonic velocity.</i>

416
00:24:32.555 --> 00:24:38.393
{\an8}<i>Our current fastest aircraft
can go roughly 4.600 miles per hour.</i>

417
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:43.440
{\an8}However. the UAP we are observing
are traveling at 40.000 miles per hour

418
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:45.067
{\an8}<i>and sometimes faster.</i>

419
00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:50.864
The next observable is
instantaneous acceleration.

420
00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:52.574
the sudden change in velocity.

421
00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:56.077
At full speed.
the SR-71. known as a Blackbird.

422
00:24:56.078 --> 00:25:00.749
{\an8}<i>requires roughly half the state of Ohio
to complete its turn.</i>

423
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:05.754
{\an8}What we are seeing with UAP are vehicles
that can make immediate right-angle turns.

424
00:25:05.755 --> 00:25:09.424
instantaneously accelerating
and stopping on a dime

425
00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:13.762
at speeds up to ten times faster
than the SR-71.

426
00:25:13.763 --> 00:25:16.181
If you're in a sustained flight.
you can get up to seven-and-a-half Gs.

427
00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:21.186
{\an8}It gets physically painful over time
to be under that amount of gravity.

428
00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:24.189
{\an8}And that's just going
from zero to 200 miles an hour

429
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.857
in about two-and-a-half seconds.

430
00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:28.485
Now. think of going zero
to thousands of miles an hour

431
00:25:28.486 --> 00:25:32.030
in less than a second.
what the force would be on your body.

432
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:34.658
The human body can only take so much
before the internal organs start

433
00:25:34.659 --> 00:25:39.329
to separate themselves from everything
they're hooked to. which is usually bad.

434
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:44.251
{\an8}Even if it was a drone. it would rip
the drone. the unmanned vehicle apart.

435
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:47.712
The next observable
is low observability.

436
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:49.798
All modern technology have a signature.

437
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:55.512
<i>For example. most aircraft leave
visible contrails as they fly.</i>

438
00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:59.182
We usually hear a sonic boom associated
with the sound barrier being broken.

439
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:03.061
<i>UAP. however. leave almost
no observable signatures.</i>

440
00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:08.233
{\an8}Our airplanes actually throw out
exhaust behind it and thrust behind it

441
00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:09.860
<i>to push it forward.</i>

442
00:26:10.987 --> 00:26:13.446
Whatever these things are.
they're not doing that.

443
00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:17.243
There is no exhaust. no particles
coming off of 'em that we can see.

444
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:23.081
The next observable
is transmedium travel.

445
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:27.294
UAP have been observed operating
in space. in air and underwater.

446
00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:30.672
and they're moving seamlessly
through each of these environments

447
00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:35.176
without any normal signature
and without compromising performance.

448
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:39.472
{\an8}We've observed a transmedium capability
of these phenomenon

449
00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:43.519
{\an8}to move from space
to the atmosphere to the ocean.

450
00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:46.146
{\an8}<i>In the Aguadilla. Puerto Rico case.</i>

451
00:26:46.147 --> 00:26:50.525
{\an8}<i>a DHS helicopter caught
the spherical object flying.</i>

452
00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:53.028
{\an8}<i>It entered the water and exited the water.</i>

453
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:56.448
so transmedium
without losing any velocity.

454
00:26:56.449 --> 00:27:01.286
{\an8}It goes into the ocean and makes
no splash or wake at 74 miles per hour.

455
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:05.540
<i>I calculated how much force you would
require just to propel a basketball</i>

456
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:07.167
under the water at 74 miles per hour.

457
00:27:07.168 --> 00:27:09.210
and you'd need
a BE-7 rocket motor.

458
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.839
or two Learjet engines
that would churn the water up like crazy.

459
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.175
So this is a technology
that's frictionless.

460
00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.677
The next
observable is anti-gravity.

461
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:21.181
UAP seemed to be defying
the natural effects of earth's gravity

462
00:27:21.182 --> 00:27:23.808
without any obvious means of doing so.

463
00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:26.436
No signs of propulsion or lift.
meaning no wings.

464
00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:29.481
no control surfaces
or ability to maneuver.

465
00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:31.107
{\an8}In 2014 to 2015.

466
00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:35.820
{\an8}we were operating off the coast of
Virginia Beach. off the eastern seaboard.

467
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:39.491
<i>It was during this time that we upgraded
our radar from the APG-73</i>

468
00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:41.076
<i>to the APG-79 radar.</i>

469
00:27:41.077 --> 00:27:46.414
<i>and this allowed us to essentially see
more objects we weren't expecting to see.</i>

470
00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:49.084
And there's a particular case
of one of these objects

471
00:27:49.085 --> 00:27:51.586
maintaining a complete stationary position

472
00:27:51.587 --> 00:27:55.632
inside of 120 knot winds.
essentially inside of a hurricane.

473
00:27:55.633 --> 00:27:57.342
{\an8} <i>They're all
going against the wind.</i>

474
00:27:57.343 --> 00:27:59.719
{\an8}<i>The wind's 120 knots from the west.</i>

475
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.180
{\an8}<i>Look at that thing! It's rotating.</i>

476
00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:05.767
It just seems like they're not affected
by the environment the way we are.

477
00:28:05.768 --> 00:28:08.186
They were tracking 'em
from above 80.000 feet.

478
00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:10.438
So for those that don't know.
above 80.000.

479
00:28:10.439 --> 00:28:12.607
<i>that's where you start getting into space.</i>

480
00:28:12.608 --> 00:28:13.817
So these things were coming down.

481
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:16.444
{\an8}They would sit for three hours
and they'd go back up.

482
00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:17.654
{\an8}which to my knowledge.

483
00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:21.366
{\an8}we don't have anything
that has the capabilities

484
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:24.619
{\an8}as far as the energy required
to come down.

485
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.371
{\an8}hangout for three hours and go up.

486
00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:30.625
{\an8}The observed UAP capability exceeds that

487
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:34.337
{\an8}of even the most advanced.
uh. human technologies

488
00:28:34.338 --> 00:28:36.673
that are developed
in classified black programs.

489
00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:40.970
From our exposure. I mean.
there's nothing we have that comes close.

490
00:28:42.513 --> 00:28:44.681
<i>There's actually a six observable.</i>

491
00:28:44.682 --> 00:28:50.229
which is not a flight characteristic.
that is biological effects.

492
00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:54.817
{\an8} <i>I got started
working on this actually in this office.</i>

493
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:57.360
{\an8}<i>There was a knock at the door.</i>

494
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.696
{\an8}<i>and two individuals
who represented themselves</i>

495
00:28:59.697 --> 00:29:04.200
{\an8}as being with the CIA and an aerospace
company came to me and asked for my help.

496
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:09.831
{\an8}They had. uh. data of military personnel.
intelligence officials

497
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:12.417
and others associated
with the Department of Defense

498
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:15.420
who had direct interactions with UAP.

499
00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:20.008
And because of that direct interaction
suffered some kind of medical harm.

500
00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:23.470
They wanted my help to look
at the so-called inflammatory

501
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:26.055
secondary events
that might be measured in the blood.

502
00:29:26.056 --> 00:29:30.727
anything from the horrific burns that
I've seen on some of the individuals

503
00:29:30.728 --> 00:29:33.938
that leads to secondary problems
with autoimmune diseases

504
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:35.565
and sclerosis. et cetera.

505
00:29:35.566 --> 00:29:39.194
and then the internal scarring
that I've seen on some individuals.

506
00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:42.906
These people had scarring inside of
their bodies and inside of their brains.

507
00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:44.032
And you have to think about it.

508
00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:47.243
You know. if you get too close
to the back end of a jet engine.

509
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:50.246
<i>or for instance. if you get too close
to the transformer system</i>

510
00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:54.584
that's just powering your neighborhood.
there's energy coming out of those things.

511
00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:56.836
I mean. those are just human technologies.

512
00:29:56.837 --> 00:30:00.465
Now imagine you've got something
which is a more advanced technology.

513
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:05.428
which is generating some kind of field
that allows these objects to move.

514
00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:08.641
if you get too close to it.
you are gonna get harmed.

515
00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:13.478
{\an8}<i>I spent ten years as an intelligence
officer for the Navy.</i>

516
00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:16.607
{\an8}And before that.
six years as Air Force intelligence.

517
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.069
<i>And I spent time on the UAP task force.</i>

518
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.279
I'm one of the intelligence officials

519
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.493
that has experienced biological effects
of encountering UAP.

520
00:30:28.494 --> 00:30:31.120
Since my first encounter.

521
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:35.876
I've observed other craft. orbs.

522
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.586
we'll call it exotic energy fields.

523
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:43.258
Unfortunately. um.
those of us who have investigated it.

524
00:30:43.259 --> 00:30:47.637
we become part of the investigation
or investigated by our colleagues.

525
00:30:47.638 --> 00:30:52.517
The population had
about a 25% mortality rate

526
00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:55.395
within seven years
of having an interaction.

527
00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:59.732
Probably important
that the public understands

528
00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:04.320
that this is more than
just an aerial phenomenon.

529
00:31:04.321 --> 00:31:08.449
{\an8}When you have an anecdote
that is accompanied by medical data.

530
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:12.996
{\an8}that's something that I can hand to
another scientist. another doctor and say.

531
00:31:12.997 --> 00:31:14.789
{\an8}"Here it is. You explain it."

532
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:19.587
We can argue about what the conclusion is.
but we can't argue that the data is real.

533
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:26.759
{\an8} <i>The deputy director
of Naval Intelligence.</i>

534
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.430
who understood
the national security concerns of UAP.

535
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:34.392
directed me to start quietly building out
a whole government interagency effort

536
00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:36.520
that ultimately became the UAP task force.

537
00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:40.440
<i>This new program
was much bigger than AATIP ever was.</i>

538
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:44.277
<i>Our mission was to detect.
analyze and catalog UAPs</i>

539
00:31:44.278 --> 00:31:47.530
<i>that pose a threat
to US national security.</i>

540
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:52.910
<i>I had handpicked members from all 16
agencies of the intelligence community.</i>

541
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:55.913
{\an8}<i>The Secretary of Defense formally
announced the UAP task force</i>

542
00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:59.208
{\an8}<i>in August 2020.
naming me the first director.</i>

543
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:02.212
Everyone in authority was
paying attention to this topic.

544
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:09.385
One distinctive moment for me was briefing
then Secretary of Treasury. Steve Mnuchin.

545
00:32:09.386 --> 00:32:12.347
<i>I got through my briefing.
And at the end of the brief.</i>

546
00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:14.974
he sat back in his chair
and he said. "You know. Jay.

547
00:32:14.975 --> 00:32:17.560
you may wonder
why I asked for this briefing."

548
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:22.899
He said. "What are the economic impacts
of the president going to the microphone

549
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.693
and telling the world we're not alone?"

550
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:30.448
I have to think about those kinds
of impacts in order to prepare

551
00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:33.535
if the president were to make that move.

552
00:32:34.745 --> 00:32:36.704
<i>Meanwhile. Chris Mellon and I</i>

553
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:39.666
<i>were working with the Senate
behind the scenes</i>

554
00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:45.296
<i>to craft UAP legislation
that was then taken by Marco Rubio</i>

555
00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:48.967
<i>and pushed
into the coronavirus relief bill.</i>

556
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:53.596
<i>When President Trump signed
this legislation into law.</i>

557
00:32:53.597 --> 00:32:58.226
it then forced the Pentagon
and the UAP task force to provide

558
00:32:58.227 --> 00:33:02.898
written reports to Congress.
both classified and unclassified.

559
00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:09.529
{\an8}The long-awaited Pentagon report
on UFOs has finally been released.

560
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.989
{\an8}The Director of National Intelligence
just a few days ago

561
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.742
{\an8}released a new report on 144 sightings.

562
00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:16.911
When we talk about sightings.
we're talking about objects

563
00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:19.956
that have been seen
by Navy or Air Force pilots

564
00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:22.250
or have been picked up
by satellite imagery.

565
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:25.128
<i>Frankly. there are a lot more sightings
than have been made public.</i>

566
00:33:25.129 --> 00:33:27.463
{\an8} <i>The report
clarifies that most incidents</i>

567
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.215
{\an8}<i>over the past two decades</i>

568
00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:35.263
{\an8}<i>are not from the US military or other
advanced US government technology.</i>

569
00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:39.642
{\an8}So the issue now is why are they here.
where are they coming from

570
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:43.771
and what is the technology
behind these devices that we're observing?

571
00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:46.607
As noisy as that
first unclassified report was.

572
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:48.317
it barely scratched the surface.

573
00:33:48.318 --> 00:33:51.946
The few elected officials that got to read
the classified version of the report.

574
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:55.783
it opened their eyes to the national
security concerns surrounding this topic.

575
00:33:55.784 --> 00:34:00.329
{\an8}There's enough obvious evidence here
that we need to take this seriously.

576
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.581
{\an8}not downplay it.

577
00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:04.250
{\an8}I don't believe they're coming
from foreign adversaries.

578
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:08.004
{\an8}Uh. if they were. that would suggest
that they have a technology

579
00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:11.215
{\an8}which is in a whole different sphere
than anything we understand.

580
00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:16.554
{\an8}Uh. frankly. China and Russia aren't there
and neither are we by the way.

581
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:18.389
{\an8}Trillions of galaxies out there.

582
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:21.101
{\an8}so who knows what might've
developed somewhere else?

583
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:31.778
{\an8}What we believe is that
there are unexplained aerial phenomena

584
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:35.656
{\an8}that have been cited
and reported by pilots.

585
00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:37.366
Navy and Air Force.

586
00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:42.663
that these phenomena have in some cases
had an impact on our training ranges.

587
00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:48.461
on our pilot's ability to fly.
train. operate and stay ready.

588
00:34:48.462 --> 00:34:55.051
Um. that alone makes it a national
security issue worth looking at.

589
00:34:55.052 --> 00:34:57.053
We don't know.

590
00:34:57.054 --> 00:35:00.265
We don't have the answers
about what these phenomena are.

591
00:35:06.522 --> 00:35:08.272
<i>As we continued
to make progress.</i>

592
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:14.071
a very powerful
disinformation campaign began.

593
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.744
<i>This effort was to destroy
my reputation and credibility. full stop.</i>

594
00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:25.248
{\an8} <i>When the government started running</i>

595
00:35:25.249 --> 00:35:27.834
{\an8}<i>this despicable disinformation campaign
against Lue.</i>

596
00:35:27.835 --> 00:35:31.629
{\an8}I actually received an email one day
from the Pentagon Public Affairs office

597
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.215
with this narrative
that they were providing back to the media

598
00:35:34.216 --> 00:35:36.217
that was completely false.

599
00:35:36.218 --> 00:35:38.886
I replied all to that email and said.
"This is wrong."

600
00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:40.305
and they ran with it anyway.

601
00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:54.235
<i>They actually told the American people
that Lue Elizondo did not work there.</i>

602
00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:56.154
and that was an outright lie.

603
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.658
<i>My family and I
suffered greatly for it.</i>

604
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:04.121
<i>All you have in your life
is really your credibility and your word.</i>

605
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:06.832
<i>It's heartbreaking.</i>

606
00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:14.547
{\an8}They don't want anybody that's
based on facts being involved in this.

607
00:36:14.548 --> 00:36:15.882
{\an8}so what do they do?

608
00:36:15.883 --> 00:36:20.595
{\an8}They go online and try to belittle
Elizondo and me and anybody else

609
00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:23.140
{\an8}that's trying to do it
in a scientific way.

610
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:28.144
<i>As hard as it was.</i>

611
00:36:28.145 --> 00:36:30.981
<i>I was still being privately encouraged
by former members of AATIP</i>

612
00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:32.356
<i>to continue the fight.</i>

613
00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:35.985
and so that gave me the motivation
to continue to press forward.

614
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:38.863
and the fire that we started
continued to spread.

615
00:36:38.864 --> 00:36:41.115
After decades of public denial.

616
00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:44.827
the Pentagon now admits
there's something out there.

617
00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:47.705
and the US Senate
wants to know what it is.

618
00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:52.668
UFOs. Unidentified Flying Objects.
are real?

619
00:36:52.669 --> 00:36:55.046
The government has already stated
for the record that they're real.

620
00:36:55.047 --> 00:36:57.965
I'm not telling you that.
the US government is telling you that.

621
00:36:57.966 --> 00:37:02.303
There's footage and records
of objects in the skies

622
00:37:02.304 --> 00:37:05.181
that we don't know exactly what they are.

623
00:37:05.182 --> 00:37:08.851
What's your viewpoint
on what these objects.

624
00:37:08.852 --> 00:37:12.439
uh. that seem to defy
all laws of physics are?

625
00:37:14.066 --> 00:37:18.444
Well. first of all.
that's a legitimate question now.

626
00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:20.613
There are lots of mysteries out there.

627
00:37:20.614 --> 00:37:24.283
It should keep us humble.
There's a lot of stuff we don't know.

628
00:37:24.284 --> 00:37:25.952
{\an8}There've been sightings
all over the world.

629
00:37:25.953 --> 00:37:29.246
{\an8}And when we talk about sightings.
the other thing I will tell you is

630
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:35.252
{\an8}it's not just a pilot or just a satellite
or some. um. intelligence collection.

631
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:39.340
{\an8}Usually we have multiple sensors
that are picking up these things.

632
00:37:39.341 --> 00:37:42.426
{\an8}There's always the question of
is there something else

633
00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:45.846
{\an8}that we simply do not understand
that might come extra-terrestrially?

634
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:47.515
{\an8}I think it's a bit presumptuous.

635
00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:52.436
{\an8}if not arrogant for us to believe that
there's no other form of life anywhere

636
00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:54.397
<i>in the entire universe.</i>

637
00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:56.649
<i>I've seen some of those videos
from Navy pilots.</i>

638
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.819
<i>and I must tell you
that they are quite eyebrow-raising.</i>

639
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.490
and. um. might in fact be
some type of phenomenon

640
00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:10.079
that is the result of something
that. um. we don't yet understand.

641
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:15.334
<i>and that could involve
some type of activity</i>

642
00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:18.547
{\an8}<i>that some might say
constitutes a different form of life.</i>

643
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:27.096
We don't know if the non-human
intelligence that is already here

644
00:38:27.097 --> 00:38:29.348
is exclusively extraterrestrial

645
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:32.893
or perhaps
some sort of cryptoterrestrial.

646
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:36.939
Some people who are into
the physics of time travel think

647
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.025
well. maybe they're time travelers.

648
00:38:39.026 --> 00:38:41.485
Even some sort of proto-human

649
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.114
that somehow branched off
from the human family tree long ago

650
00:38:45.115 --> 00:38:47.491
and is as natural
to this planet as we are.

651
00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:50.786
Some ancient civilization
that's sequestered away

652
00:38:50.787 --> 00:38:53.623
<i>somewhere on the Earth
or on the seabed.</i>

653
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:59.670
We've heard testimonials
from pilots as well as civilians

654
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:04.759
from different countries having
seen things come from the ocean.

655
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.305
unexplained things. and these aren't
missiles. they aren't rockets.

656
00:39:09.306 --> 00:39:11.849
they aren't aircraft or submarines.

657
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.601
These are other-worldly things

658
00:39:13.602 --> 00:39:17.063
that are performing maneuvers
that haven't been seen.

659
00:39:17.064 --> 00:39:21.442
In fact. we have tracked UAP
underwater going at speeds

660
00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:24.278
in excess
of several hundred miles an hour.

661
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:26.906
but without the associated signatures.

662
00:39:26.907 --> 00:39:29.492
{\an8}I retired
as the oceanographer of the Navy.

663
00:39:29.493 --> 00:39:33.580
{\an8}being the senior advisor for the Chief
of Naval Operations in the Pentagon.

664
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:37.416
{\an8}<i>But our knowledge
of the ocean's rather limited.</i>

665
00:39:37.417 --> 00:39:40.837
{\an8}<i>We haven't even explored
80% of the ocean volume.</i>

666
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:46.509
{\an8}We have mapped the surface of Mars
and the moon to a higher resolution

667
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.968
than the Earth's sea floor.

668
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:53.015
<i>Is it possible that whatever
we're seeing isn't from out there.</i>

669
00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.392
<i>it's from down there?</i>

670
00:39:55.393 --> 00:40:00.856
Are we looking at an entire
world underneath the water?

671
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:04.860
{\an8}I think it's very safe to say that with
so much of the ocean volume unexplored

672
00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:10.199
{\an8}and the sea floor unmapped that
if any intelligence were to arrive here

673
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.954
<i>and not want to be detected.
it would stay in the ocean.</i>

674
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:20.918
All these possibilities could come
with different intentions and motivations.

675
00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:27.007
Whoever it is. they're here
and they're operating here.

676
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:29.052
and they have been operating here
for a long time.

677
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:44.775
In 2022. we started pushing Congress hard
to hold public UAP hearings.

678
00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:47.571
and that's when disclosures
started to get to the next level.

679
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:56.162
{\an8}House panel is holding a public hearing
on mysterious flying objects.

680
00:40:56.163 --> 00:40:58.247
{\an8}The chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee describes this

681
00:40:58.248 --> 00:41:00.791
{\an8}as one of the great mysteries of our time.

682
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:04.795
{\an8}and it's a big day for all of these people
who have spent so many years

683
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:07.381
{\an8}pushing for more transparency
into this topic.

684
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:09.842
{\an8}Out of everything in Congress
and everything happening

685
00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:11.927
{\an8}currently in our country
and world right now.

686
00:41:11.928 --> 00:41:17.391
{\an8}the UAP topic has been
one of the only topics

687
00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:19.643
that's received
this level of bipartisan support.

688
00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.188
It's just not an issue.
at least as of yet. in this country

689
00:41:22.189 --> 00:41:25.941
that lends itself to some sort of
partisan or ideological divide.

690
00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:29.738
{\an8}Democrats and Republicans
just want to understand what's going on.

691
00:41:31.323 --> 00:41:33.490
<i>This hearing and oversight work</i>

692
00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:36.035
<i>has a simple idea at its core.</i>

693
00:41:36.036 --> 00:41:40.998
{\an8}Unidentified aerial phenomena
are a potential national security threat.

694
00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:43.042
{\an8}and they need to be treated that way.

695
00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:47.379
{\an8}UAPs are unexplained.
It's true. but they are real.

696
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.006
{\an8}They need to be investigated.

697
00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:51.884
{\an8}and many threats
they pose need to be mitigated.

698
00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:54.178
{\an8}There is something there
measurable by multiple instruments.

699
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:57.514
{\an8}and yet it seems to move
in directions that are inconsistent

700
00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:01.101
{\an8}with what we know of physics
or science. more broadly.

701
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:05.439
{\an8}There are a number of events
in which we do not have an explanation.

702
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.483
{\an8}in which there are flight characteristics

703
00:42:07.484 --> 00:42:11.195
{\an8}or signature management.
um. that we can't explain.

704
00:42:11.196 --> 00:42:13.030
{\an8}We know that our service members

705
00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:17.034
{\an8}have encountered
unidentified aerial phenomenon.

706
00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:21.538
{\an8}And because UAPs pose potential
flight safety and general security risk.

707
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:25.209
{\an8}we are committed to a focused effort
to determine their origins.

708
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.502
{\an8}The capabilities. systems.

709
00:42:26.503 --> 00:42:31.006
{\an8}processes and sources we use to observe.
record. study or analyze these phenomena

710
00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:33.509
{\an8}need to be classified
at appropriate levels.

711
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:38.055
{\an8}We do not want. we do not want
potential adversaries to know

712
00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:40.391
exactly what we're able
to see or understand

713
00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:42.768
or how we come
to the conclusions we make.

714
00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:46.647
Therefore. public disclosures
must be carefully considered

715
00:42:46.648 --> 00:42:48.441
on a case-by-case basis.

716
00:42:48.942 --> 00:42:53.612
The hearing was a historic
bipartisan effort towards transparency.

717
00:42:53.613 --> 00:42:56.282
but it left both the American public
and Congress

718
00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:58.284
with more questions than answers.

719
00:42:58.285 --> 00:42:59.994
While I was making progress.

720
00:42:59.995 --> 00:43:04.581
I learned that the Legacy Program was
quietly behind the scenes pushing back.

721
00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:06.542
and they were creating
bureaucratic hurdles.

722
00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:08.294
They were somehow
able to block the funding

723
00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:10.296
that was approved for the UAP task force.

724
00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:12.756
I can't describe it any other way
than I was just angry.

725
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:17.136
There's this hidden hand that is blocking
all of these actions and things I'm doing.

726
00:43:17.137 --> 00:43:20.222
A subversive government
overriding the real government.

727
00:43:20.223 --> 00:43:23.559
It's so bad that we really
aren't going to make progress

728
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.395
until someone shines the light on them.

729
00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:29.983
<i>Then the staff
and the members start to dig in more.</i>

730
00:43:31.151 --> 00:43:33.652
<i>They begin to understand the landscape.</i>

731
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:36.780
They begin to understand
how much secrecy there is.

732
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:39.701
<i>how much resistance there is
to coming clean on this.</i>

733
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:46.790
As Congress began hearing from
whistleblowers in classified settings.

734
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.003
they came to the realization
of the existence of the Legacy Program.

735
00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:56.800
<i>The main players in the Legacy Program</i>

736
00:43:56.801 --> 00:44:00.179
have long been
the Central Intelligence Agency.

737
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.306
the United States Air Force.

738
00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:06.977
{\an8}the Department of Energy.
and major defense contractors.

739
00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:11.107
<i>The Central Intelligence Agency
is responsible for the oversight</i>

740
00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:13.067
<i>of the overall effort.</i>

741
00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:16.528
<i>You might think of them as a little bit
as a headquarters element.</i>

742
00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:19.907
The Deputy Director of Science
and Technology at the CIA

743
00:44:19.908 --> 00:44:23.786
controls the UAP
crash retrieval portfolio.

744
00:44:23.787 --> 00:44:27.831
<i>The United States Air Force
is responsible for field operations.</i>

745
00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:32.503
These are the folks that are responsible
for deploying within moment's notice

746
00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:38.093
<i>anywhere in the world to go
secure and retrieve crashed UAP.</i>

747
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:46.100
{\an8}We have intelligence teams
quickly notified if there's some UAP event

748
00:44:46.101 --> 00:44:50.437
that might involve a crashed vehicle
or pieces from a crashed vehicle.

749
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:53.273
The United States Air Force
uses their own special forces.

750
00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:56.193
but they also coordinate
with other special forces

751
00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:57.987
in other branches of US military.

752
00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:03.617
They're so well organized
that they basically can get to a site.

753
00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:08.414
gather material. whatever it is.
and once it's in their possession.

754
00:45:08.415 --> 00:45:12.543
they have the authority to classify it.

755
00:45:12.544 --> 00:45:16.380
and therefore make any information
about it unavailable to the public.

756
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:20.135
even admission that it exists
unavailable to the public.

757
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.303
<i>The defense contractors.</i>

758
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:27.349
they're responsible for the exploitation
and the reverse engineering

759
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.934
and analysis of the materials.

760
00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:32.146
They provide technical
and advisory services

761
00:45:32.147 --> 00:45:33.856
that the government doesn't have.

762
00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:37.234
And last but not least
is the Department of Energy.

763
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:41.947
<i>They are the world's experts in anything
that is related to either atomic</i>

764
00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:45.826
or nuclear technology
or anything that gives off radiation.

765
00:45:45.827 --> 00:45:48.745
But there's another advantage
because the Department of Energy

766
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:51.915
has its own security
classification system

767
00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:56.378
well outside the overview
and oversight. if you will.

768
00:45:56.379 --> 00:46:00.757
of traditional classification systems
like the Department of Defense

769
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.593
or the intelligence community.

770
00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:07.931
They've used the security
and classification language

771
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:13.188
<i>in the Atomic Energy Act to hide
the Legacy crash retrieval program.</i>

772
00:46:16.232 --> 00:46:20.027
{\an8}The intelligence officials
that have briefed on these

773
00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:24.573
{\an8}crash retrievals have talked
about a number of different species

774
00:46:24.574 --> 00:46:27.409
{\an8}having been observed
to be associated with the crash.

775
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.497
{\an8}Bodies recovered
are not all of the same type.

776
00:46:32.207 --> 00:46:36.126
{\an8}I'm aware of at least
two advanced non-human species.

777
00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:40.089
{\an8}one of which made contact
with the Legacy crash retrieval program.

778
00:46:40.882 --> 00:46:44.968
<i>The other of which. the bodies were
recovered by the crash retrieval program</i>

779
00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:46.762
<i>in various crashes.</i>

780
00:46:46.763 --> 00:46:48.764
One of the questions is often raised.

781
00:46:48.765 --> 00:46:51.350
if they're so advanced.
why are there crashes?

782
00:46:51.351 --> 00:46:53.852
But of course. I mean. you know.

783
00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:56.647
cars are well made
and people drive them carefully.

784
00:46:56.648 --> 00:46:59.942
but there are crashes. It can happen.

785
00:46:59.943 --> 00:47:04.863
Another option that's being considered
is that maybe some of these

786
00:47:04.864 --> 00:47:07.574
were not "really crashes."

787
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:12.037
but that they were left here
for us to examine

788
00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:15.958
in order to advance
our technology forward at a faster pace.

789
00:47:15.959 --> 00:47:21.046
So in that sense. they can be seen
as gifts from a more intelligent species.

790
00:47:21.047 --> 00:47:24.508
One of the questions that would
then be raised would be. well.

791
00:47:24.509 --> 00:47:29.555
are gifts distributed differently
among different nations

792
00:47:29.556 --> 00:47:33.350
or more or less homogeneously

793
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:37.896
to see who survives
and makes progress the fastest?

794
00:47:37.897 --> 00:47:41.943
It could be a giant IQ test.
you might say.

795
00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:48.490
<i>As we brought
whistleblowers to Congress.</i>

796
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:54.079
we learned that the Legacy Program
was involved in a long running secret war

797
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.333
with other nations
to collect and reverse engineer

798
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:02.213
vehicles not made by humans.

799
00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:08.969
In this secret theater of war.

800
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:15.476
<i>the US has both allies and adversaries
in a winner takes all scenario.</i>

801
00:48:17.103 --> 00:48:21.273
<i>This is a very complicated
geopolitical landscape.</i>

802
00:48:21.274 --> 00:48:26.154
<i>where alliances and allegiances
shift like sand in the desert.</i>

803
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:32.242
{\an8}We would certainly prefer
a situation where the retrieval

804
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:37.414
{\an8}is either in international waters
or some other uncontested location

805
00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.458
<i>or maybe in an allied country.</i>

806
00:48:39.459 --> 00:48:43.962
<i>but every country in the world
would do everything in their power</i>

807
00:48:43.963 --> 00:48:47.341
to try to retrieve
an exquisite piece of technology.

808
00:48:47.342 --> 00:48:50.427
The first country that cracks
the code on this technology

809
00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:52.304
will be the leader for years to come.

810
00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:53.972
This is similar to the Manhattan Project.

811
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:55.265
<i>We developed the atomic weapon.</i>

812
00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:58.853
<i>We won the war. and it made us
a superpower for almost a century now.</i>

813
00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.356
This is the atomic weapon on steroids.

814
00:49:02.357 --> 00:49:07.444
Some of the craft observed could be
the result of say our Legacy Program.

815
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:11.406
or on the other hand.
it might be the result of advancements

816
00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:13.408
made by potential adversaries.

817
00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:18.664
{\an8}We have seen highly credible
US government intelligence

818
00:49:18.665 --> 00:49:23.752
<i>on the Soviet recovery
of a crashed UAP in 1989.</i>

819
00:49:23.753 --> 00:49:28.674
They recovered a Tic-Tac shaped UAP
that was twice as big as the Tic Tac

820
00:49:28.675 --> 00:49:32.052
that was encountered
by the USS Nimitz carrier strike group.

821
00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:37.224
and they did recover
four bodies of humanoid aliens.

822
00:49:37.225 --> 00:49:41.311
The Soviet scientists
took apart the recovered craft

823
00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:47.150
and discovered a very advanced
directed energy weapon.

824
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:49.361
China is at the top of everybody's list

825
00:49:49.362 --> 00:49:51.947
of concern right now
in the Defense Department.

826
00:49:51.948 --> 00:49:55.992
<i>Some of this UAP activity
we are seeing here in the United States</i>

827
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.911
<i>may actually be a result</i>

828
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:01.999
<i>of a Chinese UAP
reverse engineering program.</i>

829
00:50:03.126 --> 00:50:07.295
{\an8}If Xi Jinping had access to this.
if Putin had access to this.

830
00:50:07.296 --> 00:50:10.215
{\an8}and they thought
that we did not have access

831
00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:13.885
{\an8}to similar capabilities
than what they did.

832
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:17.013
do you think for a second
that they wouldn't consider

833
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:19.433
using it to achieve
their ends of domination?

834
00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:22.477
<i>And if their
approach to it is driven by science</i>

835
00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:25.021
<i>and a desire to match
what they think is ours.</i>

836
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:26.898
we'll wake up one day and realize.

837
00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:29.109
I don't know how they got there.
but they got there ahead of us.

838
00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:30.694
and now we're screwed.

839
00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:35.824
This technology can absolutely either
revolutionize the way we do things

840
00:50:35.825 --> 00:50:39.286
or completely destroy
everything that we know.

841
00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:43.749
It often reminds me of the famous speech
by President John F. Kennedy

842
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:47.627
when we were
right at the threshold of entering

843
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:51.423
into a new era of discovery in space.

844
00:50:51.424 --> 00:50:55.927
{\an8}There is new knowledge to be gained
and new rights to be won.

845
00:50:55.928 --> 00:51:01.475
{\an8}and they must be won
and used for the progress of all people.

846
00:51:01.476 --> 00:51:06.062
for space science
like nuclear science and all technology

847
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.065
has no conscience of its own.

848
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:13.820
Whether it will become a force
for good or ill depends on man.

849
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:20.452
And only if the United States
occupies a position of preeminence

850
00:51:20.453 --> 00:51:27.250
can we help decide whether this
new ocean will be a sea of peace

851
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:30.213
or a new terrifying theater of war.

852
00:51:31.756 --> 00:51:36.301
{\an8}Some of this is so secret.
there have been very. very few people

853
00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:40.473
{\an8}in our entire government that have
been allowed or provided access to it.

854
00:51:43.017 --> 00:51:46.937
<i>Some presidents have been briefed
on the basic facts about the situation.</i>

855
00:51:46.938 --> 00:51:49.564
<i>but they are not provided
with all the details.</i>

856
00:51:49.565 --> 00:51:51.358
<i>I think there's
this assumption that presidents</i>

857
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:53.819
<i>can walk in the Oval Office
on day one and say.</i>

858
00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.987
<i>"All right. take me to Roswell.
Show me the alien bodies."</i>

859
00:51:55.988 --> 00:51:57.781
{\an8}"I want to see the video. the autopsy.
I want to see the whole thing."

860
00:51:57.782 --> 00:51:58.866
{\an8}"Open it up."

861
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:01.368
{\an8}I think that really is a. um--

862
00:52:01.369 --> 00:52:06.541
{\an8}A naive understanding
of how our government works.

863
00:52:08.376 --> 00:52:12.921
Even presidents have often been
operating on a need-to-know basis.

864
00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:15.215
That's certainly true
from historic standpoint.

865
00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:18.176
The rationale. the justification was.

866
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:20.428
the president shouldn't know
about these things because that way

867
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:22.472
the president always has deniability.

868
00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:25.100
All they need is a nod
in this direction or in that direction.

869
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:27.394
but that begins
to ramp out of control.

870
00:52:27.395 --> 00:52:29.855
Frankly. I don't even know
if president would know who to ask.

871
00:52:29.856 --> 00:52:31.857
You could go to the director of the CIA.

872
00:52:31.858 --> 00:52:34.693
nowadays. the director
of National Intelligence. and ask them.

873
00:52:34.694 --> 00:52:38.321
and even that person may not know
because those people rotate.

874
00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:41.783
but people three layers underneath them
that are there for 30 years.

875
00:52:41.784 --> 00:52:44.744
to them. it's like. "I've seen
these people come and go."

876
00:52:44.745 --> 00:52:46.580
"I have no obligation
to tell them it exists."

877
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:47.873
It just never percolates up.

878
00:52:47.874 --> 00:52:51.167
A lot of people have this assumption
that the director of CIA's

879
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:52.669
right onto everything
and knows everything.

880
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:54.880
The director of CIA
is a political appointee.

881
00:52:54.881 --> 00:52:57.632
Quite frankly.
they're temporary help.

882
00:52:57.633 --> 00:53:00.594
whereas the Director
of Science Technology at CIA.

883
00:53:00.595 --> 00:53:02.470
this is a career
intelligence professional.

884
00:53:02.471 --> 00:53:04.431
that's where you're gonna put the program.

885
00:53:04.432 --> 00:53:07.225
I had a few private conversations

886
00:53:07.226 --> 00:53:10.687
<i>with former president
George Herbert Walker Bush in 2003</i>

887
00:53:10.688 --> 00:53:13.398
in which he told me that

888
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:16.651
when he became the CIA director
in the Ford administration.

889
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:21.865
he was not briefed on the
Legacy UAP crash retrieval program.

890
00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:24.993
{\an8}But he later found out about it.
and he informed me

891
00:53:24.994 --> 00:53:27.746
{\an8}that there were a number
of crash retrievals that had taken place

892
00:53:27.747 --> 00:53:30.457
since the mid-1940s.

893
00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:32.542
And he also informed me

894
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:36.880
{\an8}of a UAP event that took place
at Holloman Air Force Base in 1964.

895
00:53:36.881 --> 00:53:40.550
{\an8}<i>where three UAPs approached
the Air Force Base.</i>

896
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:43.011
{\an8}<i>One of them landed on the tarmac.</i>

897
00:53:43.012 --> 00:53:48.141
And a non-human entity
deboarded the craft that landed

898
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:53.897
and interacted with uniformed Air Force
and civilian CIA personnel.

899
00:53:53.898 --> 00:53:55.649
And when he asked for more details.

900
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.110
<i>he was told that
he did not have a need to know.</i>

901
00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:03.740
{\an8}I served over 30 years
as a Army Green Beret

902
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:08.203
{\an8}in the United States Army.
I ended my career as Secretary of Defense.

903
00:54:08.204 --> 00:54:13.291
Some intelligence official decided.
I. the acting Secretary of Defense.

904
00:54:13.292 --> 00:54:16.379
did not have a need to know
about the UAP topic.

905
00:54:16.963 --> 00:54:19.047
{\an8} <i>Several of
my colleagues participated</i>

906
00:54:19.048 --> 00:54:22.342
{\an8}<i>in a panel organized
by the George Bush administration</i>

907
00:54:22.343 --> 00:54:25.596
<i>when the administration contemplated
going public with disclosure.</i>

908
00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:30.558
{\an8}What it was a group of ten or 12 people
from intelligence agencies.

909
00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:33.269
{\an8}from the military. some business people.

910
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.898
<i>and they said. "Here's what's going on."</i>

911
00:54:36.899 --> 00:54:43.279
"The Americans. the Russians.
and Chinese all have crash retrieved craft

912
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.115
from some other civilization.

913
00:54:45.116 --> 00:54:48.451
and there's some belief at this point

914
00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:50.578
that maybe
this should be revealed to the public.

915
00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:54.374
and we want to know
what would the consequences be?"

916
00:54:54.375 --> 00:54:57.043
This is a topic
that has a potential to create

917
00:54:57.044 --> 00:55:01.339
serious ontological shock to society.

918
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.049
It's not just national security.

919
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:09.431
It's psychological. it's sociological.
it's theological and it's philosophical.

920
00:55:09.432 --> 00:55:10.974
{\an8}It's undermining in many ways.

921
00:55:10.975 --> 00:55:14.561
{\an8}it's troubling to a lot of people to say
that there's something else out there

922
00:55:14.562 --> 00:55:17.313
{\an8}either otherworldly. interdimensional.

923
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:21.568
I think unfortunately
it goes against our traditions.

924
00:55:21.569 --> 00:55:24.404
our cultural traditions.
our religious traditions.

925
00:55:24.405 --> 00:55:27.575
and it challenges
the beliefs of a lot of people.

926
00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:33.747
<i>The Vatican has irrefutable evidence
that non-human intelligence exists.</i>

927
00:55:33.748 --> 00:55:36.291
<i>Although publicly
they don't want to acknowledge it.</i>

928
00:55:36.292 --> 00:55:38.794
{\an8}<i>privately.
they are very well aware of this.</i>

929
00:55:40.546 --> 00:55:44.424
{\an8}What happens when society realizes
everything it's been taught

930
00:55:44.425 --> 00:55:48.970
about the entire history of our species
has been wrong

931
00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:53.725
and everybody learns all at once
that we're not the top of the food chain?

932
00:55:53.726 --> 00:55:56.102
We're not the alpha predators.

933
00:55:56.103 --> 00:56:00.231
It would be a shakeup for institutions.

934
00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:05.070
it'd be a shakeup for norms.
it'd be a shakeup in society.

935
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:09.866
{\an8}One has to be careful
and one has to remember

936
00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:11.242
{\an8}that it's conceivable

937
00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:14.871
{\an8}that there's something
that's so disturbing or disruptive

938
00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:18.792
or negative that there is a rationale

939
00:56:18.793 --> 00:56:22.420
for not immediately disclosing
all of that information.

940
00:56:22.421 --> 00:56:25.715
We actually came up
with a list of 64 areas

941
00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:30.345
that really would be impacted to some
significant degree by such a disclosure.

942
00:56:30.346 --> 00:56:34.933
We add up all the numbers. it looks
like this would be kind of a bad idea.

943
00:56:34.934 --> 00:56:39.729
Did you go through the secret files.
the UFO documents?

944
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.440
Now that you're out of office.
you can do anything you want. right?

945
00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:44.526
That's true. Yeah.

946
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:46.070
Uh. but I'm not telling you.

947
00:56:49.073 --> 00:56:53.034
{\an8}Without a doubt.
there's hardly been any program

948
00:56:53.035 --> 00:56:58.164
{\an8}that has been so successfully
kept out of the public eye

949
00:56:58.165 --> 00:57:02.085
{\an8}as anything like crash retrievals
of unknown craft.

950
00:57:02.086 --> 00:57:06.714
This line of strong control started

951
00:57:06.715 --> 00:57:11.219
{\an8}at least in the Truman administration
with the Roswell crash.

952
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.514
{\an8}In AATIP. we learned that the UAP event

953
00:57:14.515 --> 00:57:20.270
at the US Army airfield
in Roswell in 1947 did actually occur.

954
00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:23.273
It was described to be
a boot-heel shaped UAP

955
00:57:23.274 --> 00:57:26.401
<i>that broke into two pieces on impact.</i>

956
00:57:26.402 --> 00:57:29.404
And observers saw
what looked like hieroglyphics

957
00:57:29.405 --> 00:57:30.655
or some type of writing on it.

958
00:57:30.656 --> 00:57:33.575
You might describe 'em
as runes or glyphs. hieroglyphs.

959
00:57:33.576 --> 00:57:35.535
that were actually on the craft itself.

960
00:57:35.536 --> 00:57:40.415
And within that crash.
non-human bodies were recovered.

961
00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:45.003
Four non-human bodies were recovered
from the UAP crash at Roswell.

962
00:57:45.004 --> 00:57:47.922
The recovered material
rom the crash. including the bodies.

963
00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:49.591
were all sent up to Wright Field.

964
00:57:49.592 --> 00:57:52.468
which is now called
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

965
00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:55.347
<i>That's where the US had
their best reverse engineers.</i>

966
00:57:56.765 --> 00:58:00.059
Think about the context
for everything in 1947.

967
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.770
<i>The US had just won World War II</i>

968
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:07.234
and was <i>entering into
a Cold War with the USSR.</i>

969
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:15.992
These UAP presented a technology
of unfathomable power.

970
00:58:15.993 --> 00:58:20.955
It was imperative that the US be able
to reverse engineer this new technology

971
00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:24.125
before anybody else or before
anybody else even knew about it.

972
00:58:24.126 --> 00:58:26.878
You can't tell your friends
without telling your enemies.

973
00:58:26.879 --> 00:58:31.216
That's a key component to every decision
as to what we do or do not release.

974
00:58:31.217 --> 00:58:32.634
Back in 1947.

975
00:58:32.635 --> 00:58:36.387
{\an8}when they looked at this and they realized
it was real and they realized

976
00:58:36.388 --> 00:58:38.806
{\an8}they had no idea what it was.

977
00:58:38.807 --> 00:58:42.310
{\an8}This was something you couldn't
just talk about because the role

978
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:45.313
{\an8}<i>of the President of the United States
and the role of the military</i>

979
00:58:45.314 --> 00:58:48.399
{\an8}is to defend the United States
and to protect its citizens.

980
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.985
If this is something
that they can't protect against.

981
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:53.529
they're not gonna come out and say it.
They're not gonna scare anybody.

982
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.741
They don't want to tell
the American public about the threat

983
00:58:56.742 --> 00:58:58.619
because there's nothing
they can do about it.

984
00:58:59.662 --> 00:59:04.374
<i>It was only a couple months after
Roswell that President Truman signed</i>

985
00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:06.292
<i>the National Security Act of 1947.</i>

986
00:59:06.293 --> 00:59:11.256
which established both the Air Force
and the Central Intelligence Agency.

987
00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:14.884
That was the start point in which
both the CIA and the Air Force

988
00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:19.138
began to take
operational control of the UAP topic.

989
00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:21.891
<i>But it wasn't until
a couple of years later</i>

990
00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:25.395
<i>when Truman signed
the Central Intelligence Agency Act</i>

991
00:59:25.396 --> 00:59:28.648
<i>that really allowed. endorsed the CIA</i>

992
00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:31.693
<i>to be able to run
secret intelligence operations</i>

993
00:59:31.694 --> 00:59:34.279
<i>outside the normal
routine oversight channels.</i>

994
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.908
Basically be able to run operations
without anybody knowing.

995
00:59:39.118 --> 00:59:42.662
From Roswell on.
the strategy for dealing with the public

996
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:46.291
and ensuring US secrecy is maintained

997
00:59:46.292 --> 00:59:50.878
was to basically adopt the strategy
of deny everything. admit nothing.

998
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.839
make counter accusations.

999
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.968
<i>put out false narratives.
intimidate and discredit witnesses.</i>

1000
00:59:56.969 --> 01:00:00.471
In essence. deny. deny. deny.

1001
01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.266
Establish stigma surrounding this topic

1002
01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.435
in order to prevent
any type of disclosure.

1003
01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:12.442
Executive Order 12333 bans covert action
to influence the public and the media.

1004
01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:16.571
but the Legacy crash retrieval program
has been ignoring that.

1005
01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:20.908
In fact. they are aggressively
influencing public opinion

1006
01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:23.828
by using an active
disinformation campaign.

1007
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:28.541
{\an8}To create a tradition of disbelief.
where you basically start very early.

1008
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:31.461
{\an8}"Nah. nah. everybody
who sees UFOs are crackpots."

1009
01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:34.630
{\an8}and then that gets built in.
you know. to the media enterprise.

1010
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:38.092
it gets built into Hollywood.
it gets built into the public.

1011
01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.471
CIA funded Hollywood movies
in order to create that ridicule factor

1012
01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:42.930
that they still use to this day.

1013
01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:47.685
{\an8}Do you believe that the recent spike
in UFO encounters--

1014
01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.313
{\an8}I get the UFO question?

1015
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.648
{\an8}-  Yeah. you do!
- Come on. man!

1016
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:55.151
{\an8}I'm not--

1017
01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.778
-  Would you tell us?
- I'm just--

1018
01:00:56.779 --> 01:01:00.281
You know. I loved <i>E.T.</i> the movie.
but I'm just gonna leave it there.

1019
01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:04.077
Up until very recently. there was
zero incentive for a naval aviator

1020
01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:05.870
to come forward and say.
"This is what I saw."

1021
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:08.998
And honestly. up until very recently.
there was zero incentive for a US Senator

1022
01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:10.750
to talk about it
because people would think.

1023
01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.502
"What's wrong? This guy's a weirdo."

1024
01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:15.254
Over the years. military service members.

1025
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:18.800
intelligence officials and even
private citizens have been ridiculed

1026
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:22.220
and made to look crazy to the point
where people have lost their jobs.

1027
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:24.222
they've lost their ability
to provide for their families.

1028
01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.140
they lost their security clearances.

1029
01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:30.645
These people had their lives ruined
simply because they spoke the truth

1030
01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:33.272
about what they learned or what they saw.

1031
01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.566
{\an8}People that come forward with this.

1032
01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:39.570
{\an8}um. I feel like they've taken
their life in their own hands.

1033
01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:42.240
{\an8}People say. well. government
can't keep a secret.

1034
01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.158
{\an8}Well. there are a number of
programs I've been involved in

1035
01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:46.994
{\an8}that have never gotten revealed.

1036
01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:51.165
The truth of the matter is
people and programs can be kept secret.

1037
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:54.585
Usually it's just out of personal.
wanting to protect oneself.

1038
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:58.631
This is the most successful
disinformation campaign

1039
01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.050
in the history of the US government.

1040
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:04.470
The irony in this is that
the deception campaign

1041
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:07.557
to create stigma was so successful

1042
01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:11.602
it actually inadvertently
created a new unforeseen problem.

1043
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:15.273
{\an8}Stigma has been a tremendous problem

1044
01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:18.693
{\an8}that it's actually a national
security threat to the United States.

1045
01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:23.781
Other countries are not suffering
from the stigma that we are.

1046
01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:29.495
so we are already. as Americans.
at a disadvantage.

1047
01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:33.374
How can we expect
to maintain a strategic advantage

1048
01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:37.420
when 99.999% of all scientists here
in this country

1049
01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.255
don't even think it's real?

1050
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.216
{\an8}Science moves forward on the basis
of exchanging information.

1051
01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:47.680
{\an8}and when it's all tied up and held down.
you just can't make progress.

1052
01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:52.518
You had information being locked away
that frankly could improve the lives

1053
01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:58.108
of every human being on this planet
and change the trajectory for our species.

1054
01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:03.362
This information was
and is still being locked down

1055
01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:05.531
by the Legacy crash retrieval program.

1056
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:09.535
Too much information resides
in different stove pipes.

1057
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:13.706
It's controlled by different baronies
and different fiefdoms spread throughout

1058
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.291
the National Security kingdom.

1059
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.585
They each view information as power.

1060
01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:20.087
They're each reluctant
to share information.

1061
01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.840
They hoard it.
They like to trade it like a currency.

1062
01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:27.094
All of these things conspire to prevent us

1063
01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:31.390
from getting the big picture
and bringing the information together.

1064
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.477
It's worth noting
that the Air Force didn't contribute.

1065
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:41.442
uh. any or maybe just
a tiny number of. uh. reports of UAPs.

1066
01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:44.987
Notwithstanding the fact
that the Air Force controls

1067
01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.740
<i>the North American
Aerospace Defense Command.</i>

1068
01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.785
<i>they're responsible
for space surveillance.</i>

1069
01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:53.871
<i>They have aircraft
with superior radar systems</i>

1070
01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:56.457
operating in the same training ranges

1071
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:59.669
where the Navy is seeing
and reporting these aircraft.

1072
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:03.548
and yet they claim
they don't have evidence of this.

1073
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:05.174
Imagine we had a situation

1074
01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:08.594
where we're saying there are
unidentified submarines

1075
01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.180
off the coast of the United States.

1076
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.516
and the only reports we got
were from the Air Force

1077
01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.769
and the Navy had nothing to say about it.

1078
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:19.313
<i>During the George
W. Bush administration.</i>

1079
01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:24.110
<i>the president routinely went down
to his ranch in Stephenville. Texas.</i>

1080
01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:28.448
{\an8}and I see reporting of UAP activity
over the ranch.

1081
01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:34.620
{\an8}F-16s from a nearby Air Force base
were alerted to intercept this object.

1082
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.956
<i>People on the ground saw it.</i>

1083
01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:41.419
So I go down and I start asking
questions. "Hey. what did you chase?"

1084
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.421
"I'm acting on behalf
of the US government.

1085
01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:46.048
and we're trying
to understand what you saw."

1086
01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.760
And they look me in the eyes and said.
"Jay. we cannot tell you what we saw

1087
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.431
because the OSI. Air Force
Office of Special Investigations.

1088
01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:56.142
came in here. had us sign
non-disclosure agreements."

1089
01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:58.185
"We did see something.
we did scramble on something.

1090
01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.562
but we can't talk to you about it."

1091
01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:04.025
Historically. every time
a military member had a UAP encounter.

1092
01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:06.611
it was very quickly swept under the rug.

1093
01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:08.446
and they were discouraged
from talking about it.

1094
01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:11.699
{\an8}They put a form down
as a non-disclosure form.

1095
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.910
{\an8}He came storming across to me.
He said. "Don't you ever say that again."

1096
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.454
{\an8}"You don't ever speak of this."

1097
01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:17.913
{\an8}And it made it very clear
that it's something

1098
01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:21.417
{\an8}we shouldn't be talking about
and just keep our mouth shut.

1099
01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.045
{\an8}There was a culture of silence.

1100
01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:25.379
{\an8}I didn't talk to anybody about it.

1101
01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.799
{\an8}not my wife. not my colleagues.
not people I knew. They just shut up.

1102
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.552
{\an8}There's ramifications
if you were to divulge

1103
01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.347
{\an8}any of this information to anyone.

1104
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.561
{\an8}<i>We received an alarm
at our closest missile site.</i>

1105
01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:46.942
<i>There was an object directly above
that ICBM nuclear missile.</i>

1106
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.153
<i>right on top of the blast door.</i>

1107
01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:52.073
<i>No noise. no sound whatsoever.</i>

1108
01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:55.284
<i>And it looked like
a mini sun sitting in the air.</i>

1109
01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.245
<i>It was the size
of a Super Walmart building.</i>

1110
01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.581
{\an8}Not just a Walmart.
I mean a Super Walmart.

1111
01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:02.166
{\an8}This thing was gargantuan.

1112
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:06.587
{\an8}And how it could suspend itself was just
completely unnatural to what we know of

1113
01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.548
{\an8}as anything that can fly or hover.

1114
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:18.683
{\an8}The captain was looking.
just looking up with his mouth open.

1115
01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:21.143
{\an8}And I look up and I see

1116
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:24.106
<i>this object right over
the missile launch tube.</i>

1117
01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:31.655
<i>Multifaceted. matte black finish.
an oddly shaped diamond.</i>

1118
01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.908
<i>Absolutely silent. made no noise.
There was no means of propulsion.</i>

1119
01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:39.705
<i>Fifty feet up in the air.
sitting absolutely still.</i>

1120
01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:45.584
And it was amazing.
and we kind of looked at one another.

1121
01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:49.255
And we were just human beings
witnessing something extraordinary.

1122
01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:54.427
And while we're watching this thing.
it went from dead still.

1123
01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:58.222
and it shot off toward the horizon
and was gone.

1124
01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:01.601
Absolutely instant acceleration.

1125
01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:12.070
{\an8} <i>We had 60 cameras so that
the engineers at Boeing and Douglas</i>

1126
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.075
{\an8}could see every millisecond
of the ignition.

1127
01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:21.704
<i>The missile in question
that we photographed was an Atlas D</i>

1128
01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:26.584
<i>carrying. as part of an experiment.
a dummy nuclear warhead.</i>

1129
01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:29.628
As it was flying along.
the warhead. the chaff.

1130
01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.714
something else entered the frame.

1131
01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:35.634
It shot a beam of light.
and it hit the warhead.

1132
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.052
flew up like this.

1133
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.430
shot another beam of light down
at the warhead. went like this.

1134
01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:42.516
shot under the beam of light
at the warhead. went under here.

1135
01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:45.895
shot a beam of light at the warhead.
and then flew out the way it had come in.

1136
01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:47.438
All the while. everything in our frame

1137
01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:49.982
was moving along
at 8.000 to 9.000 miles an hour.

1138
01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.359
There's nothing of ours
that could've done that.

1139
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.029
What could have done that?

1140
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:05.372
{\an8}There was this red orange light
hovering above the front gate.

1141
01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:09.211
{\an8}It was about 40 feet in diameter.
sort of oval shape.

1142
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:16.717
{\an8}<i>And each missile was announcing
a guidance and control system failure.</i>

1143
01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:22.473
{\an8}Our missiles were starting to go down.
so we had all ten of 'em go down.

1144
01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:29.523
Within the span of eight days.
we lost 20 nuclear missiles to UFOs.

1145
01:08:33.235 --> 01:08:35.986
{\an8}Vandenberg is home to the infrastructure

1146
01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:38.906
{\an8}that supports
our National Missile Defense project.

1147
01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.658
{\an8}the system that defends our country

1148
01:08:40.659 --> 01:08:43.452
{\an8}from incoming ballistic missiles
and nuclear weapons.

1149
01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.372
So it's one of the most
important bases we have.

1150
01:08:46.373 --> 01:08:48.457
<i>On October 14th. 2003.</i>

1151
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:50.960
<i>I showed up to work
at Vandenberg Air Force Base</i>

1152
01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:55.297
and immediately everybody just
started to tell me about this UFO incident

1153
01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.424
that had happened earlier that morning.

1154
01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.761
{\an8}I reported for work. um.
at Vandenberg Air Force Base.

1155
01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:02.930
{\an8}We were given a briefing
earlier in the day.

1156
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:06.225
{\an8}Some Boeing contractors
had witnessed a UAP incursion.

1157
01:09:06.226 --> 01:09:10.104
<i>Three Boeing contractors
had called in and reported</i>

1158
01:09:10.105 --> 01:09:14.066
<i>that a gigantic red square object</i>

1159
01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:17.111
was floating over the launchpad
at low altitude.

1160
01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:21.156
It was making no noise.
it had no obvious signs of propulsion.

1161
01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.450
and it was just hovering silently.

1162
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.161
It was a very serious
security breach of the area.

1163
01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.581
And we were told just to be vigilant
when we were out on our shift that night.

1164
01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:33.711
And I spent the most of the day driving
around the base looking for these objects.

1165
01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:36.505
Later that night.
myself and five security forces members.

1166
01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.091
we observed a bright light
approaching the base.

1167
01:09:39.092 --> 01:09:41.427
As it got closer.
the light was no longer visible.

1168
01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:44.972
and it was massive.
the size of a football field.

1169
01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:47.141
<i>almost rectangular in shape.</i>

1170
01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:48.350
<i>It was just floating there.</i>

1171
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:52.897
<i>No propulsion system. no windows.
It was matte black.</i>

1172
01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:55.482
<i>We observed it for another 45 seconds.</i>

1173
01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:58.819
And then it shot off thousands
of miles an hour up the coast.

1174
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.323
I talked to all the direct witnesses.
over a dozen people.

1175
01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:04.867
and even from
their different vantage points.

1176
01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:08.621
they all told the same story.
They all saw the same thing.

1177
01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:13.292
The UAP activity surrounding
nuclear weapons is not a historic issue.

1178
01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.253
It's an ongoing issue.

1179
01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:20.132
Despite the longstanding denial
by the United States Air Force.

1180
01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:25.346
we now have both former and current
very senior Air Force officials

1181
01:10:25.347 --> 01:10:29.433
stating for the record
that in fact the Air Force has had

1182
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:32.895
a longstanding involvement in UAP.

1183
01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:37.650
{\an8}I served in the Air Force
for about 32 years.

1184
01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:41.153
<i>and my last job in the Air Force
was chief of Air Force Intelligence.</i>

1185
01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:44.365
<i>prior to becoming director of
the Defense Intelligence Agency.</i>

1186
01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:47.034
When I served in the Air Force.

1187
01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:54.083
uh. there was an active program
to track anomalous activities

1188
01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:57.503
that. uh. you know.
we couldn't otherwise explain.

1189
01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:04.094
Many of them connected with ranges
out west. notably. um. Area 51.

1190
01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:10.557
<i>As Congress learned more
about the Legacy Program.</i>

1191
01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:15.563
<i>they realized how powerful and influential
the defense contractors have become.</i>

1192
01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:23.487
As we look at the actual structure
of the interaction between the government

1193
01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:26.323
and private industry in this UAP area.

1194
01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:29.159
<i>over the years. it has morphed.</i>

1195
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.748
<i>transitioned into it being largely
in the aegis of the contractors.</i>

1196
01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.458
If you do something within the government.

1197
01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:39.920
eventually it can be accessed
by Freedom of Information Act.

1198
01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:42.548
But if you do something
through contractors.

1199
01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:46.135
they're not available through
Freedom of Information Act.

1200
01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:50.806
I had been involved myself in projects
where we made sure that the material

1201
01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:54.226
was under contractor labels

1202
01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:58.063
so they couldn't be
accessed easily by the public.

1203
01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:01.316
But what happens with government.
you need continuity.

1204
01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.610
People move. people die. people retire.

1205
01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:06.905
So what winds up happening is
you have these Legacy efforts going on

1206
01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:10.117
in the government contractor side
involving UAP.

1207
01:12:10.118 --> 01:12:13.203
{\an8}And then I. the government official
in charge of this program. leave

1208
01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:16.081
{\an8}and someone else takes my place.
and that person might have

1209
01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.125
{\an8}a little bit of awareness
that this project existed.

1210
01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:19.877
But then they're replaced
by a third person

1211
01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:21.920
who has no idea that the project existed.

1212
01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:24.089
But the corporate entity that received

1213
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.633
this technology
is still trying to develop it.

1214
01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.635
and so they begin to commercialize that.

1215
01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:31.472
Some of the stuff begins to seep out
in these great innovations

1216
01:12:31.473 --> 01:12:33.849
that some company's coming up with
and making money on.

1217
01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:36.685
and they claim it belongs to them
and it's proprietary.

1218
01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:40.355
Um. and the people in government
who know where it came from originally.

1219
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:44.276
they're long gone and their successors
have no idea that it was there at all.

1220
01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:48.864
And so you can start to foresee
where you create in corporate hands

1221
01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.532
an extraordinary amount of power.

1222
01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:55.454
The real risk in transferring technology
that is not useful to us today

1223
01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:56.955
to a corporate entity.

1224
01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.707
Over decades. that corporate entity

1225
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.376
comes to basically possess
and control access to it

1226
01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.671
for their own purposes.
not for the purposes of national security.

1227
01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.381
{\an8}In the councils of government.

1228
01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:10.469
{\an8}we must guard against
the acquisition of unwarranted influence.

1229
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:15.974
whether sought or unsought
by the military industrial complex.

1230
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.477
The potential for the disastrous rise

1231
01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:21.731
of misplaced power exists
and will persist.

1232
01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:25.400
We must never let
the weight of this combination

1233
01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.487
endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

1234
01:13:28.488 --> 01:13:31.323
{\an8}The reason why our democracy is so strong

1235
01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:34.118
{\an8}because it's of the people
and by the people and for the people.

1236
01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:38.288
{\an8}It's not acceptable to have secret parts
of government that no one ever sees.

1237
01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:40.040
{\an8}It would be unconscionable.

1238
01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:42.918
{\an8}It's against our constitution
and it's wrong.

1239
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:46.588
{\an8}Non-human intelligence
is not government information.

1240
01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:50.552
{\an8}and the government should not be keeping
that knowledge from the people.

1241
01:13:54.389 --> 01:13:55.681
<i>Before he passed away.</i>

1242
01:13:55.682 --> 01:13:58.642
<i>I had the privilege
of seeing Senator Harry Reid</i>

1243
01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:01.979
<i>quite a few times
in his private residence.</i>

1244
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.567
He explained to me that he was
once provided information

1245
01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:09.236
on the Legacy Program but denied access.

1246
01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:10.988
He was incensed by that.

1247
01:14:10.989 --> 01:14:14.867
And when the opportunity
came to sponsor AATIP.

1248
01:14:14.868 --> 01:14:16.952
he jumped at the opportunity

1249
01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.496
in order to ensure
that Congress and the government

1250
01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:22.040
had visibility into this topic.

1251
01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:25.210
And frankly. we wouldn't be
where we are today

1252
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:28.672
if it wasn't for the courage
of Senator Harry Reid.

1253
01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:32.385
{\an8}Why the federal government
all these years has covered up.

1254
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.930
{\an8}put brake pads on everything. stopped it?

1255
01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:40.559
{\an8}I think it's very. very bad
for our country.

1256
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.229
Should we study this stuff?
The answer is yes.

1257
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.399
And that's all this was about.

1258
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.946
For decades. our government assumed

1259
01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.657
there must be different
exotic technologies responsible

1260
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.576
for each of the observables.

1261
01:14:57.577 --> 01:15:01.622
but our scientists realized
one breakthrough technology

1262
01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:05.001
<i>could actually be responsible
for everything.</i>

1263
01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.589
With enough energy.
you could create a bubble.

1264
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.716
a warp bubble around a spacecraft

1265
01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:15.177
that would have a different property
of space-time

1266
01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.639
inside the bubble
than on the outside of the bubble.

1267
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:22.184
<i>This energy field
would completely isolate</i>

1268
01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:23.937
<i>the craft from the environment.</i>

1269
01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:29.691
So you might ask then.
how does the craft actually move forward

1270
01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.235
within its bubble?

1271
01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:36.323
The craft inside the bubble has a way
of altering the bubble's properties

1272
01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:40.285
<i>in order to change
its direction of motion.</i>

1273
01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:44.122
<i>Such that you have
a downward press in front</i>

1274
01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:47.000
<i>and an upward press behind.</i>

1275
01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.586
So it'd be like riding
space-time in the same way

1276
01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:52.090
that a surfer would ride
a wave in the ocean.

1277
01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:59.263
And we observe hypersonic velocity
and instantaneous acceleration.

1278
01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:03.183
and the reason is that time is moving
differently for people inside the bubble

1279
01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:05.018
versus people outside the bubble.

1280
01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:08.480
Whoever's inside the craft would
feel like they're just cruising along.

1281
01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:12.192
They wouldn't be feeling the effects of
what looks like speeds and accelerations

1282
01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:14.529
that would turn
a human being into pudding.

1283
01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:19.866
This one breakthrough
can be the key to interstellar travel.

1284
01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:22.452
{\an8}where you want to travel long distances

1285
01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:25.747
{\an8}without taking enormous amounts
of subjective time.

1286
01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:30.252
{\an8}<i>We'd also have low observability
because the bubble acts as a barrier</i>

1287
01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.462
<i>between two space-time environments.</i>

1288
01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:35.632
This would eliminate or conceal
most of the known signatures

1289
01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.175
of conventional technologies.

1290
01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:41.722
This is why radar would have difficulty
tracking a craft because the signal

1291
01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:45.684
<i>from the radar would be distorted
by the energy field around the craft.</i>

1292
01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:49.438
The radar signatures literally
just moved around the bubble

1293
01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:51.982
and doesn't reflect back
to the radar emitter.

1294
01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:56.737
So it's not surprising
when someone takes a photo of a UAP.

1295
01:16:56.738 --> 01:16:59.614
they find they get
a fuzzy and distorted picture

1296
01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:03.286
<i>because they're actually taking
a photo through a space-time barrier.</i>

1297
01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.457
What's been happening recently

1298
01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:12.544
is that we have upgraded our
sensor systems on our fighter aircraft.

1299
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:16.757
And these images that are now picked up
with our advanced sensor systems.

1300
01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:21.511
we can begin to see the actual structure
of the energy field around the craft.

1301
01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:24.140
<i>which in the past
they would not have been able to do.</i>

1302
01:17:25.767 --> 01:17:28.018
We also observed transmedium travel

1303
01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:31.980
because the craft is moving
within its own space-time.

1304
01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:36.861
and the outside environment through
which it's moving is inconsequential.

1305
01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:40.697
{\an8}<i>This would allow a craft
to go seamlessly from space</i>

1306
01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:44.117
<i>through the atmosphere into the water.</i>

1307
01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:48.163
And they could do so because
the warp bubble that surrounds them

1308
01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:51.875
shunts air molecules
or ocean water molecules

1309
01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:55.838
around the craft so that it could
move effortlessly through any medium.

1310
01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:02.260
We also observe anti-gravity
because the Earth's gravitational field

1311
01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:06.516
is no longer having any effect
on the craft inside its space-time bubble.

1312
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.684
{\an8}<i>This is why a craft does not need say.</i>

1313
01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:14.564
engines or wings or other aspects
that we would associate with a craft

1314
01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.650
that needs to fly in the atmosphere.

1315
01:18:16.651 --> 01:18:19.028
It's really disconnected
from the atmosphere.

1316
01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:24.116
{\an8}<i>And the energy field
associated with these craft</i>

1317
01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:26.701
causes a highly energetic
wave of radiation.

1318
01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:31.123
which is why people getting too close
to a UAP can experience biological effects

1319
01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:32.583
that are harmful to humans.

1320
01:18:35.253 --> 01:18:40.298
{\an8}Now that we understand that these craft
exist in a space-time environment

1321
01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:44.052
that's different from the exterior
space-time environment.

1322
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.597
this can begin to explain
claimed observations by say

1323
01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:51.643
military people who have approached
and gotten into a craft

1324
01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:55.147
and find that time is running
at a different rate inside the craft

1325
01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:57.858
than time running outside the craft.

1326
01:18:57.859 --> 01:19:00.694
They think they're only there
for a few minutes.

1327
01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.989
when they come outside the craft.
some hours have gone by.

1328
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:06.783
so they feel like
they've got missing time.

1329
01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:11.621
Or similarly. with respect
to the size of the craft.

1330
01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.582
if someone is outside the craft

1331
01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:17.377
and it looks like
a small craft and they go inside.

1332
01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:20.046
it's the size of a football stadium.

1333
01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:24.092
Once you've realized
that space and time

1334
01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:27.179
are being engineered to be different

1335
01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.140
inside the craft
than they are outside the craft.

1336
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:34.394
then these anomalies that people
report that sound completely absurd

1337
01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:36.772
can actually make sense.

1338
01:19:41.903 --> 01:19:45.948
<i>The top issue is
what is their energy supply?</i>

1339
01:19:46.324 --> 01:19:51.119
{\an8}<i>Because the evidence for how much
energy they're using per unit time</i>

1340
01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.499
{\an8}<i>so exceeds any kind of power levels
that we can generate.</i>

1341
01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.919
{\an8}UAPs have exhibited propulsive
performance characteristics

1342
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:04.341
{\an8}that imply the generation
of 1.100 billion watts of power.

1343
01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:06.218
This is more than 100 times

1344
01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:09.888
the daily electrical utility power
generated in the US.

1345
01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:11.973
Let that sink in.

1346
01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:18.981
One hundred times the daily
power generation of the entire nation.

1347
01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:26.238
There are two prevailing hypotheses
for how UAPs create the energy

1348
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:28.657
that warps space-time around them.

1349
01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:34.079
and one is that the spacecraft
can produce. uh. its own bubble

1350
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:39.000
of vacuum energy around the craft.
which is also known as zero-point energy.

1351
01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:43.630
And the other one is that the craft
could be using quantum entanglement

1352
01:20:43.631 --> 01:20:47.260
to draw on a remote
distant source of energy.

1353
01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:53.057
{\an8} <i>If we can understand
the technology that we're observing.</i>

1354
01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:59.229
{\an8}it has so many
potentially beneficial impacts.

1355
01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:02.357
{\an8}including clean energy.

1356
01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:05.944
{\an8}We're seeing these craft
doing unbelievable things.

1357
01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:08.698
{\an8}and it's not combustion engineering.

1358
01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:16.037
<i>This is technology that
could replace oil. gas and coal</i>

1359
01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.874
<i>and protect our planet
for future generations.</i>

1360
01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.501
How can we use these technologies

1361
01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:23.670
and all the capabilities
that come from it.

1362
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:27.299
not to fight a war.
but to increase our standard of living.

1363
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.760
you know. to increase our ability
to get from place to place.

1364
01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.054
{\an8}We can talk more about teleportation.

1365
01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:36.641
{\an8}we could talk more about.
uh. hypersonic travel.

1366
01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:39.936
{\an8}Being able to take human beings
to the next evolutionary step.

1367
01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:41.022
which is the stars.

1368
01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:44.108
<i>being able to explore
new star systems and planets.</i>

1369
01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:47.527
On the other hand.

1370
01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:52.282
you'd have to weigh the consequences
of sharing. uh. with the world.

1371
01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:54.492
knowing that there are
bad actors out there.

1372
01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:57.329
If our adversaries would have
access to that same technologies.

1373
01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:02.042
they could flip that into some very.
very powerful weapons of mass destruction.

1374
01:22:02.043 --> 01:22:06.129
{\an8}You could put a nuclear bomb
inside one of these things and let it fly

1375
01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:09.674
{\an8}right through a building.
through concrete. through steel.

1376
01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.593
{\an8}wherever you want it.
anywhere in the world.

1377
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:15.096
We want to talk about it publicly
and encourage folks to talk about it.

1378
01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.932
but while we're talking about it publicly.

1379
01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:21.978
our adversaries are paying attention to
context clues to piece things together

1380
01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:24.481
about possible technologies
that we may have

1381
01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:26.316
that they don't have access to.

1382
01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:28.109
So it's a fine line.

1383
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:32.072
I would opt for making
any new energy source

1384
01:22:32.073 --> 01:22:36.117
a humanitarian. uh. issue.

1385
01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:38.244
That it should be open.

1386
01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:41.539
And we know how to do that.
We've done that with nuclear power.

1387
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:46.670
{\an8}If the capabilities
that exist come to the forefront

1388
01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:49.714
{\an8}and they become known to the world.

1389
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:53.886
{\an8}it might very well be that
it is to the benefit of mankind.

1390
01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:04.020
<i>While Congress had learned
a great deal about the Legacy Program.</i>

1391
01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:08.358
<i>whistleblowers were still afraid
to reveal the most secretive details</i>

1392
01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:10.360
<i>about the UAP technology</i>

1393
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:13.197
<i>and non-human bodies
in the program's possession.</i>

1394
01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:19.577
We'd been interviewing folks
that would have had evidence of

1395
01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:24.333
or first-hand direct contact
with either materials

1396
01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:25.917
or a program itself.

1397
01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:28.879
{\an8}They have worked on craft

1398
01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:33.426
{\an8}of out of this world origin. but until...

1399
01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:39.431
they leak a video before they commit
suicide by shooting themselves

1400
01:23:39.432 --> 01:23:41.015
in the back of the head four times.

1401
01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:44.602
um. I just don't know
that that's going to get out.

1402
01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:49.399
Those people whose job it is
to make sure information doesn't get out

1403
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.778
will use whatever tool they can find
to try to convince people

1404
01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.238
they shouldn't come forward.

1405
01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:58.825
{\an8}We have people that have very high
clearances both today and in the past.

1406
01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:00.618
{\an8}who did really important work
for our government

1407
01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:02.620
{\an8}or continue to do
important work for the government.

1408
01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.289
{\an8}who have come forward with some claims

1409
01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:07.959
{\an8}about the US having in the past
recovered exotic materials.

1410
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.794
{\an8}and then we reverse
engineered those materials

1411
01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:13.256
{\an8}to make advances in our own
defenses and technologies.

1412
01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:17.177
{\an8}And that they signed agreements
that they would face jail time

1413
01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:19.554
{\an8}or in some cases some people claim
it would cost them their lives

1414
01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.431
{\an8}if they spoke out about these things.

1415
01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:23.266
{\an8}When I have
a whistleblower coming forward.

1416
01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.101
{\an8}telling me
that they're in fear of their life

1417
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:29.022
{\an8}and that people have been hurt
protecting and hiding this information.

1418
01:24:29.023 --> 01:24:31.233
that gives me reason for concern.

1419
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:34.194
<i>Determined to get to the truth.</i>

1420
01:24:34.195 --> 01:24:39.325
<i>it was Chris Mellon who led the charge
to help Congress draft unprecedented</i>

1421
01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:40.910
<i>UAP whistleblower protections.</i>

1422
01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.996
<i>And in December of 2022.</i>

1423
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.792
<i>President Biden signed
the legislation into law.</i>

1424
01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:51.169
{\an8}So even for those who signed NDAs.

1425
01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:54.256
{\an8}they still have a right and an opportunity
to talk about this

1426
01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:58.552
{\an8}in a very healthy and productive way
that informs the American public.

1427
01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:05.141
{\an8}Bombshell claims
from a military whistleblower.

1428
01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:09.395
{\an8}UFO wreckage recovered
by the US kept classified

1429
01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:12.482
{\an8}by a secret
government program for decades.

1430
01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:18.279
{\an8}The UAP task force was refused access
to. um. a broad crash retrieval program.

1431
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.367
{\an8}<i>retrieving non-human
origin technical vehicles.</i>

1432
01:25:22.368 --> 01:25:24.452
{\an8}call it spacecraft if you will.

1433
01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:29.290
{\an8}Non-human exotic origin vehicles
that have either landed or crashed.

1434
01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:32.710
I handpicked Dave Grusch
to be part of my UAP task force.

1435
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:36.798
Everything that Dave uncovered is true.
but it barely scratches the surface.

1436
01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:41.553
{\an8}There's a sophisticated disinformation
campaign targeting the US populace.

1437
01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:44.180
{\an8}which is extremely unethical and immoral.

1438
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:47.559
{\an8}Have people been killed
to protect the secret?

1439
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.855
{\an8}That was an ongoing concern.

1440
01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:04.409
Dave has been working
tirelessly behind the scenes

1441
01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:07.370
with Congress as well.
and we were really poking the bear.

1442
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:08.746
We were making a lot of progress.

1443
01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:11.249
We were getting
a lot of information to Congress.

1444
01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:17.130
um. and it wasn't necessarily symbiotic

1445
01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:19.257
with the Legacy Program in their desires.

1446
01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:25.180
I remember one evening. uh. I was
sitting with my wife on the front porch.

1447
01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:28.057
and I received a call.

1448
01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:31.060
I recognized the voice
of one of a friend of mine.

1449
01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.939
and he happened to be
one of staffers on the Hill.

1450
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.399
and he was very shooken up and said.

1451
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.569
"Listen. we had
a very interesting meeting on the Hill."

1452
01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:44.073
And an extremely. extremely
senior person in the US government

1453
01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:48.202
in the intelligence community
told Congress. for the record.

1454
01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:50.914
that there was a committee
of 27 individuals.

1455
01:26:50.915 --> 01:26:53.499
and I'm not going to go
into code names here.

1456
01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:58.212
that were mulling over the idea
of using extreme measures

1457
01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.049
to silence David and myself.

1458
01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:03.051
Kill us.

1459
01:27:03.052 --> 01:27:05.637
Now. people say.
"Oh. come on. that's conspiracy."

1460
01:27:05.638 --> 01:27:07.222
No. it's not.

1461
01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:11.059
We have done it before.

1462
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:15.355
Under certain circumstances. we have
killed Americans without due process.

1463
01:27:15.356 --> 01:27:19.567
If they are a clear and present
national security threat.

1464
01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.611
we can kill Americans.

1465
01:27:21.612 --> 01:27:24.405
Now. it's not done very often. but we can.

1466
01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:27.868
Without a fair trial.
they just poof. disappear. right?

1467
01:27:28.619 --> 01:27:29.745
So here I am.

1468
01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:34.582
If I wind up in a month from now
floating in the Potomac somewhere.

1469
01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:38.837
you know what happened.
You know what happened. This is the truth.

1470
01:27:41.048 --> 01:27:43.759
What else you want to know?

1471
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:55.061
<i>Last year. House Intelligence
Committee held a hearing on UAPs.</i>

1472
01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:58.439
They brought in some Pentagon bureaucrats
who only had two answers

1473
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.276
to the questions they were asked.
"I don't know." or "That's classified."

1474
01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.362
This hearing is going to be different.

1475
01:28:04.363 --> 01:28:07.156
This time. we had credible witnesses

1476
01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:10.910
testifying before Congress
and American people under oath.

1477
01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:14.956
This was a tremendously proud moment
for my colleagues and myself

1478
01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:18.918
to watch the fire that we started
continue to grow.

1479
01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:22.880
{\an8} <i>The subcommittee hearing
on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.</i>

1480
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.632
<i>or UAPs. will come to order.</i>

1481
01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:27.969
The reality is the American public
deserves to know.

1482
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:30.596
And you better be careful
about a government

1483
01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:32.181
that doesn't trust its people

1484
01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:34.559
because there's no telling
what they'll pull on you.

1485
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.686
{\an8}It's really important
that we're here in a bipartisan way

1486
01:28:36.687 --> 01:28:40.441
{\an8}to have this conversation.
which is about national security.

1487
01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:46.279
{\an8}The American public has a right to learn
about technologies of unknown origins.

1488
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.908
{\an8}non-human intelligence
and unexplainable phenomenon.

1489
01:28:50.576 --> 01:28:54.078
{\an8}You solemnly swear or affirm that
the testimony you're about to give

1490
01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:57.623
{\an8}is the truth. the whole truth. and nothing
but the truth. so help you God?

1491
01:28:57.624 --> 01:28:59.542
{\an8}- Yes.
- Yep.

1492
01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:02.962
{\an8}I was informed in the course
of my official duties

1493
01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:08.301
{\an8}of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval
and reverse engineering program.

1494
01:29:08.302 --> 01:29:13.347
{\an8}I am hopeful that my actions will
ultimately lead to a positive outcome

1495
01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.016
{\an8}of increased transparency.

1496
01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:18.686
{\an8}We were primarily seeing dark gray
or black cubes inside of a clear sphere.

1497
01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:22.648
{\an8}where the apex or tips of the cube
were touching the inside of that sphere.

1498
01:29:22.649 --> 01:29:24.650
{\an8}Since the events initially occurred.

1499
01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:26.861
{\an8}I've learned the objects
have been detected

1500
01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.322
{\an8}essentially where all operations.

1501
01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:31.783
{\an8}Navy operations are being
conducted across the world.

1502
01:29:31.784 --> 01:29:33.576
{\an8}These objects have been observed

1503
01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:36.162
{\an8}for over two weeks coming down
from over 80.000 feet.

1504
01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:37.997
{\an8}rapidly descending to 20.000 feet.

1505
01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:40.917
{\an8}hanging out for hours
and then going straight back up.

1506
01:29:40.918 --> 01:29:44.921
{\an8}It wasn't until 2009. until Jay Stratton
had contacted me to investigate.

1507
01:29:44.922 --> 01:29:48.382
{\an8}Unbeknownst to all. he was part
of the AATIP program in the Pentagon.

1508
01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.510
{\an8}Are you aware of any individuals
that are participating

1509
01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:53.429
{\an8}in reverse engineering programs
for non-terrestrial craft?

1510
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:54.764
{\an8}Personally. yes. Mm-hm.

1511
01:29:54.765 --> 01:29:57.141
{\an8}Do you believe that our government
is in possession of UAPs?

1512
01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:58.726
{\an8}I know the exact locations.

1513
01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:01.854
{\an8}I actually had the people
with the first-hand knowledge.

1514
01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:04.857
{\an8}um. provide a protected disclosure
to the inspector general.

1515
01:30:04.858 --> 01:30:08.236
{\an8}Do we have the bodies
of the pilots who piloted this craft?

1516
01:30:08.237 --> 01:30:11.322
{\an8}Biologics came with some
of these recoveries. Yeah.

1517
01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:14.200
{\an8}- Non-human biologics?
- Non-human.

1518
01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:18.454
{\an8}I was wondering if you could speak
a little bit about the interaction

1519
01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:20.289
{\an8}between defense contractor companies

1520
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:23.042
{\an8}and any UAP-related
programs or activities.

1521
01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:25.586
{\an8}The contractors.
"the metal benders." so to speak.

1522
01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:30.091
{\an8}they're the ones actually doing specific
performance on government contracts.

1523
01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:32.218
{\an8}How does a program like that get funded?

1524
01:30:32.219 --> 01:30:33.594
{\an8}Misappropriation of funds.

1525
01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:35.263
{\an8}Does that mean that there is money

1526
01:30:35.264 --> 01:30:37.265
{\an8}in the budget
that is set to go to a program

1527
01:30:37.266 --> 01:30:38.933
{\an8}but it doesn't.
and it goes to something else?

1528
01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.518
{\an8}Yes. I have specific knowledge of that.

1529
01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:42.478
{\an8} Mr. Graves and Fravor.

1530
01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:45.773
{\an8}in the event that your encounters
had become hostile.

1531
01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:48.734
{\an8}would you have had
the capability to defend yourself?

1532
01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:52.321
{\an8}- Absolutely not. sir.
- No.

1533
01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:56.117
{\an8}What we experienced was well beyond
the material science and the capabilities

1534
01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:58.494
that we had at the time.
that we have currently

1535
01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:00.788
or we're going to have
in the next 20 years.

1536
01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:03.791
We have nothing that can stop in midair
and go the other direction.

1537
01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.251
nor do we have anything that can.

1538
01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:07.253
like in our situation.
come down from space.

1539
01:31:07.254 --> 01:31:08.713
hangout for three hours and go back up.

1540
01:31:08.714 --> 01:31:13.259
{\an8}Is it possible that these UAPs would be
probing our capabilities. yes or no?

1541
01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.844
{\an8}- Mr. Graves?
- Yes.

1542
01:31:14.845 --> 01:31:16.721
{\an8}-  Grusch?
- Yes. definitely.

1543
01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:19.557
{\an8}Do you have any personal knowledge of
people who have been harmed or injured

1544
01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:23.603
{\an8}in efforts to cover up or conceal
these extraterrestrial technology?

1545
01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:24.855
{\an8}Yes.

1546
01:31:26.732 --> 01:31:27.733
{\an8}Personally.

1547
01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:32.111
{\an8}Anyone been murdered that you know of?

1548
01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:33.446
{\an8}I have to be careful.

1549
01:31:33.447 --> 01:31:36.616
{\an8}I directed people with that knowledge
to the appropriate authorities.

1550
01:31:36.617 --> 01:31:39.952
{\an8}There clearly is a threat
to the national security

1551
01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:42.038
{\an8}of the United States of America.

1552
01:31:42.039 --> 01:31:43.706
{\an8} Brave witnesses here.

1553
01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:46.292
{\an8}They took an oath to uphold
the constitution of the United States

1554
01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:49.421
{\an8}and dadgummit. they're doing it.
and we owe them a debt of gratitude.

1555
01:31:55.052 --> 01:32:00.556
{\an8}On Capitol Hill today. a bipartisan call
for more government transparency on UFOs.

1556
01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:05.728
{\an8}One was asked about alien bodies.
two others talked about seeing UAPs.

1557
01:32:05.729 --> 01:32:09.815
{\an8}The US government operates
a UFO crash retrieval program

1558
01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:15.196
{\an8}and has a UFO and the remains
of "a non-human or non-human pilots

1559
01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:16.822
{\an8}in its possession."

1560
01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:21.035
<i>And when Dave Grusch
said the words non-human biologics.</i>

1561
01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:22.536
<i>there was an audible gasp.</i>

1562
01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:27.375
I worked with David Grusch when we
both contributed to the UAP task force.

1563
01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:31.379
and everything he said under oath
to the Congress and what he put down

1564
01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.757
in his whistleblower complaint
is 100% true.

1565
01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:38.719
{\an8}A Pentagon report is detailing
a dramatic increase in UFO sightings.

1566
01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.889
The Pentagon released its report
on UFO sightings today.

1567
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:47.020
{\an8}saying an additional 366 sightings
have been investigated since 2021.

1568
01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:50.982
{\an8}Now the Defense Department is admitting
not just a couple of incidents.

1569
01:32:50.983 --> 01:32:52.525
hundreds of incidents.

1570
01:32:52.526 --> 01:32:55.361
scores of incidents
with multiple sensor systems.

1571
01:32:55.362 --> 01:32:56.862
multiple witnesses.

1572
01:32:56.863 --> 01:33:01.659
A NASA task force is holding
its first meeting on UFOs.

1573
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:06.247
{\an8}NASA commissioned an independent
study team to examine

1574
01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:09.417
{\an8}unidentified anomalous phenomena.

1575
01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:14.130
{\an8}and this is the first time
that NASA has taken concrete action

1576
01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:16.841
{\an8}to seriously look into UAP.

1577
01:33:16.842 --> 01:33:20.177
{\an8}Are we alone?
Personally. I don't think we are.

1578
01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:23.681
{\an8}I wasn't prepared for the number
of incursions that I see.

1579
01:33:23.682 --> 01:33:28.769
{\an8}This merging capability
outstrips the operational framework

1580
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:31.148
that we have to address it.

1581
01:33:38.864 --> 01:33:42.658
{\an8} <i>Since mankind first started
developing atomic energy.</i>

1582
01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:45.536
<i>there has been consistent UAP activity</i>

1583
01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:49.833
<i>at sites involved with
the atomic and nuclear process.</i>

1584
01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:56.672
<i>We have evolved more technically
in the last 80 years</i>

1585
01:33:56.673 --> 01:34:00.177
<i>than we have
in the previous 200.000 years.</i>

1586
01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:06.015
<i>And the uptick in UAP activity
has increased in line</i>

1587
01:34:06.016 --> 01:34:08.810
<i>with our advancement
of harnessing energy.</i>

1588
01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:15.983
<i>We realized we are on the path
to exploiting the energy levels needed</i>

1589
01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:20.029
<i>to warp space-time.
and UAP have been observing</i>

1590
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:23.449
and clearly been interested
in our rapid progress.

1591
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:28.996
Despite developing
massively new technologies.

1592
01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:32.625
we don't see
an equivalent moral increase

1593
01:34:32.626 --> 01:34:35.836
<i>in how we deal with each other.</i>

1594
01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:38.756
{\an8} <i>We are still invading
sovereign nations.</i>

1595
01:34:38.757 --> 01:34:43.135
{\an8}<i>We're still threatening nuclear war
eighty years after dropping atomic bombs</i>

1596
01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:46.932
<i>that vaporized hundreds
of thousands of human beings.</i>

1597
01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:50.477
<i>Let's face it. we are a violent species.</i>

1598
01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:55.815
So if I were a species
from somewhere else.

1599
01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:58.109
even if I were
a hidden species on the planet

1600
01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:01.112
who saw how we were coming up this curve

1601
01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:04.990
of. you know.
atomic energy and nuclear energy.

1602
01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:07.159
and then beginning to realize

1603
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.745
what it takes to do
their kind of technologies

1604
01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:14.166
with warping time
and warping space and so on.

1605
01:35:14.167 --> 01:35:18.671
I can imagine that could be seen
as a threat to another species

1606
01:35:18.672 --> 01:35:21.715
because they would recognize
that once it's only a matter of time

1607
01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.217
and they're going to be doing
what we're doing

1608
01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:24.593
and then we're gonna have
to deal with them.

1609
01:35:24.594 --> 01:35:28.222
So it doesn't surprise me
that their highest priority would be

1610
01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:32.268
<i>to identify what threats they might face</i>

1611
01:35:32.269 --> 01:35:34.228
<i>to learn everything about them.</i>

1612
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:37.523
This pattern of activity
seems to me utterly logical.

1613
01:35:37.524 --> 01:35:42.695
It seems to me to be
an extension of the evolutionary process

1614
01:35:42.696 --> 01:35:45.573
that governs life
writ large as we know it.

1615
01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:47.868
which is self-preservation is number one.

1616
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:54.999
{\an8}When I hear stories of either
nuclear weapons sites being shut down

1617
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.127
{\an8}or turned on. what that tells me
is something quite interesting.

1618
01:35:58.128 --> 01:36:01.755
First off is that something
has a technology capable of reaching

1619
01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:04.758
into our nuclear weapons systems

1620
01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:07.470
at a distance in ways
that we don't understand.

1621
01:36:07.471 --> 01:36:11.891
Okay. that's just capability.
But you ask the question about intent.

1622
01:36:11.892 --> 01:36:13.934
at the very least. what it tells me

1623
01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:18.314
is that they're showing us
what they can do to us at will

1624
01:36:18.315 --> 01:36:20.399
or with us or they can stop us.

1625
01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:25.070
Now. they didn't stop us from
blowing something up in Japan.

1626
01:36:25.071 --> 01:36:27.114
They didn't stop the first of the bombs.

1627
01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:32.912
At some level. they're willing to let us
see the consequences of our actions.

1628
01:36:32.913 --> 01:36:36.081
But at another level.
they're willing to also show us that

1629
01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:41.003
"You might think that you could
hurt us one day. but you can't."

1630
01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:46.800
"We really can just reach in and stop you
or cause you to blow each other up."

1631
01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.969
"Because at the end of the day.
you're getting in our way.

1632
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:51.388
and you're really starting to annoy us."

1633
01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:55.309
So even though it has been reported
that some of our fighter pilots

1634
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:59.939
have chased these objects
and even fired missiles at them.

1635
01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:03.234
there has not been
some kind of strong negative retaliation.

1636
01:37:03.235 --> 01:37:06.737
So it'd be pretty easy to come
to the conclusion they're friendly.

1637
01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:09.907
and that's fine.
and there's no real threat there.

1638
01:37:09.908 --> 01:37:14.370
But the truth of the matter is. uh.
you have to take into account. well.

1639
01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:16.956
under what condition.
you know. that might change.

1640
01:37:16.957 --> 01:37:19.333
For example. if you have ants

1641
01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:22.461
at the back of your yard.
uh. they're not a threat to you.

1642
01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:26.423
so that's fine.
but if they come and invade your house.

1643
01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:28.092
suddenly they're a threat.

1644
01:37:28.093 --> 01:37:31.178
And so it could be
the same in this situation.

1645
01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:35.225
So at least within the defense
and intelligence industry.

1646
01:37:36.226 --> 01:37:41.063
we automatically assume the worst
because we want to be prepared

1647
01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:43.524
against the worst if it should happen.

1648
01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:47.695
There's a concern within the defense
and intelligence communities

1649
01:37:47.696 --> 01:37:51.699
that UAPs have been undertaking
long-term surveillance

1650
01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:57.580
of human technological advancement
for the possibility that they may need

1651
01:37:57.581 --> 01:38:02.793
to intervene to prevent
a conflict between us and them.

1652
01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:07.423
{\an8}One of the reasons that I am
so ardent about this issue is

1653
01:38:07.424 --> 01:38:11.343
{\an8}because I think it has the potential
to change the perspective

1654
01:38:11.344 --> 01:38:16.515
and the outlook of world leaders
and the populations of those countries

1655
01:38:16.516 --> 01:38:22.896
to see more of what we have in common
and the challenges that we face together.

1656
01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:25.733
If we're gonna survive as a species.

1657
01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:31.113
we need unprecedented levels
of international collaboration.

1658
01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:36.785
{\an8}<i>I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide</i>

1659
01:38:36.786 --> 01:38:41.916
{\an8}would vanish if we were facing
an alien threat from outside this world.

1660
01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:02.186
<i>Thomas Jefferson once said.</i>

1661
01:39:02.187 --> 01:39:05.981
{\an8}<i>"I'm not an advocate for frequent
changes in laws and constitutions."</i>

1662
01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:09.318
{\an8}<i>"But laws and institutions
must go hand in hand</i>

1663
01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:11.695
<i>with the progress of the human mind."</i>

1664
01:39:11.696 --> 01:39:14.406
<i>"As that becomes more developed.
more enlightened.</i>

1665
01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:16.200
<i>as new discoveries are made.</i>

1666
01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:20.162
<i>new truths discovered and manners
and opinions change."</i>

1667
01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:22.247
<i>"With the change of circumstances.</i>

1668
01:39:22.248 --> 01:39:27.462
<i>institutions must advance
also to keep pace with the times."</i>

1669
01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:33.050
<i>Our current Senate leadership feels
the same as our founding fathers.</i>

1670
01:39:33.051 --> 01:39:35.761
<i>And throughout the fall of 2023.</i>

1671
01:39:35.762 --> 01:39:38.222
<i>my colleagues and I
met with Senate leadership</i>

1672
01:39:38.223 --> 01:39:40.516
<i>to help give them clarity on the facts</i>

1673
01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:45.313
<i>as they fought for the most historic
UAP legislation we've ever had.</i>

1674
01:39:46.106 --> 01:39:50.401
<i>Never in the history of our nation
have we ever seen any type</i>

1675
01:39:50.402 --> 01:39:55.280
<i>of legislation regarding UAP
that is as detailed and specific</i>

1676
01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:57.408
and as directive as this one.

1677
01:39:57.409 --> 01:40:01.578
{\an8}United States government has gathered
a great deal of information about UAPs

1678
01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:05.999
{\an8}over many decades. but has refused
to share it with the American people.

1679
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.962
{\an8}That is wrong. and additionally
it breeds mistrust.

1680
01:40:09.963 --> 01:40:14.174
{\an8}There is. we believe. information
and data that has been collected

1681
01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:16.468
{\an8}by more than just
the Department of Defense.

1682
01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:19.972
{\an8}but by other agencies of the
federal government as well.

1683
01:40:19.973 --> 01:40:23.434
Information on UAPs has also
been withheld from Congress.

1684
01:40:23.435 --> 01:40:25.728
which was a violation
of the laws requiring

1685
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:27.896
full notification
to the legislative branch.

1686
01:40:27.897 --> 01:40:33.736
<i>The bill I worked on with Senator Rounds
offered a common sense solution.</i>

1687
01:40:33.737 --> 01:40:37.531
the Unidentified Anomalous
Phenomena Disclosure Act.

1688
01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:41.952
{\an8}This would be the most aggressive
measure that we've frankly ever seen

1689
01:40:41.953 --> 01:40:45.414
{\an8}in history when it comes to disclosure
about what the government knows

1690
01:40:45.415 --> 01:40:48.375
{\an8}and has. as it relates to UAPs.

1691
01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:51.712
<i>The measure would also give
the federal government control</i>

1692
01:40:51.713 --> 01:40:55.215
<i>over all recovered technologies
of unknown origin</i>

1693
01:40:55.216 --> 01:40:59.303
<i>and biological evidence
of non-human intelligence.</i>

1694
01:40:59.304 --> 01:41:03.640
Eminent domain allows the US government
to take control of anything

1695
01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:05.434
for national security reasons

1696
01:41:05.435 --> 01:41:07.728
or for the betterment
of the American people.

1697
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:11.899
{\an8}A requirement as a transparency measure
for the government to obtain

1698
01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:17.237
{\an8}any recovered UAP material
or biological remains

1699
01:41:17.238 --> 01:41:21.158
{\an8}that may have been provided
to private entities in the past

1700
01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:25.871
and thereby hidden from Congress
and the American people.

1701
01:41:25.872 --> 01:41:30.959
The eminent domain section
was not crafted accidentally.

1702
01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:35.380
It was designed to be put in there
clearly to lay out our expectations.

1703
01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:38.759
Contractors may have information
that they have held.

1704
01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.013
or materials that they have held
over an extended period of time.

1705
01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:46.975
and this is our way of addressing it
and making it clear

1706
01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:50.270
that it should be delivered
in an appropriate fashion.

1707
01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:52.898
and that they need
to be negotiating with us now.

1708
01:41:52.899 --> 01:41:55.442
{\an8}Their bipartisan plan
for more transparency

1709
01:41:55.443 --> 01:41:58.111
{\an8}is getting some major pushback though.

1710
01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:02.533
{\an8}The. um. defense contractors
give money legally

1711
01:42:02.534 --> 01:42:07.663
{\an8}to a lot of my colleagues that provide
a great deal of the pushback on this.

1712
01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:11.333
There's a lot of money coming from
the defense industry to support

1713
01:42:11.334 --> 01:42:13.043
elected officials with their campaigns.

1714
01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:15.879
And then when the time comes for these
elected officials to try to get

1715
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.257
to the bottom of things.
they're compromised.

1716
01:42:18.258 --> 01:42:21.093
Something with the capabilities
of traveling light years.

1717
01:42:21.094 --> 01:42:26.139
not showing a heat signature
and the energy capabilities of that.

1718
01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.559
that would put the Pentagon
out of business.

1719
01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.188
We wouldn't be fighting these
worthless wars overseas over oil

1720
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:35.232
and American boys and girls
wouldn't be dying.

1721
01:42:35.233 --> 01:42:37.235
It would put war pigs out of business.

1722
01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:40.988
<i>Unfortunately.
there was too much resistance</i>

1723
01:42:40.989 --> 01:42:46.286
<i>and the most historic elements of the
proposed legislation did not become law.</i>

1724
01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:48.787
We've got a big mess on our hands.

1725
01:42:48.788 --> 01:42:51.290
We've got 80 years of lies and deception

1726
01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:53.750
that quite frankly ruined
a lot of people's lives.

1727
01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:56.962
and nobody wants
to take responsibility for that.

1728
01:42:56.963 --> 01:43:00.883
This is not an endeavor here
to go out and punish anyone.

1729
01:43:00.884 --> 01:43:03.969
But nonetheless. we would need to know
what they learnt. taxpayers paid for this.

1730
01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:07.306
And I think offering amnesty
is extremely important.

1731
01:43:07.307 --> 01:43:10.475
Let the past stay in the past.
then collectively move forward.

1732
01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:13.228
It's essential we keep
working on our proposal.

1733
01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:18.108
<i>I'd like to just acknowledge
my dear friend. the late Harry Reid.</i>

1734
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:20.819
a mentor who cared
about this issue a great deal.

1735
01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.988
So he's looking down and smiling on us.

1736
01:43:22.989 --> 01:43:26.325
but he's also importuning us
to get the rest of this done.

1737
01:43:26.326 --> 01:43:29.161
which we will do everything
we can to make happen.

1738
01:43:29.162 --> 01:43:33.373
But where there was smoke. there was
a fire. and Congress is now aware of it.

1739
01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:38.922
And so what that allows us to do
is circle the wagons and try again.

1740
01:43:43.718 --> 01:43:46.179
<i>Welcome to today's historic hearing.</i>

1741
01:43:47.305 --> 01:43:50.432
<i>There are certain individuals
who didn't want this hearing to happen</i>

1742
01:43:50.433 --> 01:43:53.478
<i>because they feared
what might be disclosed.</i>

1743
01:43:55.021 --> 01:43:59.232
Do you solemnly swear to affirm that
the testimony that you are about to give

1744
01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:01.026
{\an8}is the truth. the whole truth.

1745
01:44:01.027 --> 01:44:03.862
{\an8}and nothing but the truth.
so help you God?

1746
01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:05.405
{\an8} I do.

1747
01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:09.201
{\an8}Has the government conducted secret
UAP crash retrieval programs? Yes or no?

1748
01:44:09.202 --> 01:44:10.410
{\an8}Yes.

1749
01:44:10.411 --> 01:44:13.830
{\an8}Were they designed to identify and
reverse engineer alien craft. yes or no?

1750
01:44:13.831 --> 01:44:15.666
{\an8}Yes.

1751
01:44:15.667 --> 01:44:18.293
{\an8}Excessive secrecy
has led to grave misdeeds

1752
01:44:18.294 --> 01:44:22.214
{\an8}against loyal civil servants.
military personnel. and the public

1753
01:44:22.215 --> 01:44:26.468
{\an8}all to hide the fact
that we are not alone in the cosmos.

1754
01:44:26.469 --> 01:44:29.012
{\an8}The US is in possession
of UAP technologies.

1755
01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:31.056
{\an8}as are some of our adversaries.

1756
01:44:31.057 --> 01:44:34.518
{\an8}We are in the midst
of a multi-decade secretive arms race.

1757
01:44:34.519 --> 01:44:37.896
{\an8}One funded
by misallocated taxpayer dollars

1758
01:44:37.897 --> 01:44:41.984
{\an8}and hidden from our elected
representatives and oversight bodies.

1759
01:44:41.985 --> 01:44:44.486
{\an8}Now that we know UAP
are interacting with humanity.

1760
01:44:44.487 --> 01:44:46.196
{\an8}we should not turn a blind eye.

1761
01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:49.533
{\an8}but instead boldly face
this new reality and learn from it.

1762
01:44:49.534 --> 01:44:52.619
{\an8}One of the most important actions
that can be taken relative to exposing

1763
01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:56.123
{\an8}the truth of UAP is to combat the stigma.

1764
01:44:56.124 --> 01:45:00.544
{\an8}NASA personnel stepping forward
and participating in such discussions

1765
01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:03.923
{\an8}would make a powerful statement
to the scientific community

1766
01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:07.843
{\an8}that UAP should be taken seriously
and researched accordingly.

1767
01:45:07.844 --> 01:45:09.594
{\an8}To the incoming administration
and Congress.

1768
01:45:09.595 --> 01:45:12.973
{\an8}I say to you. we need
immediate public transparency.

1769
01:45:12.974 --> 01:45:15.600
{\an8}and this hearing
is an important step on that journey.

1770
01:45:15.601 --> 01:45:17.102
{\an8}The truth is out there.

1771
01:45:17.103 --> 01:45:21.232
{\an8}We just need to be bold enough
and brave enough to face it.

1772
01:45:29.115 --> 01:45:31.491
America wants their pizzas
in 30 minutes or less.

1773
01:45:31.492 --> 01:45:33.326
and that's about our attention span.

1774
01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:37.205
And I think the Legacy Program is. um--

1775
01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:41.043
They think that America
will draw its attention somewhere else.

1776
01:45:41.044 --> 01:45:42.919
and I just don't think that's the case.

1777
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.379
I think we've let the fuse.

1778
01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:48.968
I think the American people
are ready to receive the truth.

1779
01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:56.558
<i>Sitting here
in a Senate building</i>

1780
01:45:56.559 --> 01:46:00.187
recognizing what change
has been occurring.

1781
01:46:00.188 --> 01:46:03.607
I never thought I'd see
this day come frankly.

1782
01:46:03.608 --> 01:46:06.026
And now that I see it here.

1783
01:46:06.027 --> 01:46:09.654
I am unbelievably hopeful

1784
01:46:09.655 --> 01:46:13.450
that it's going to filter down
into our society

1785
01:46:13.451 --> 01:46:16.912
to where everyone realizes
that the human species

1786
01:46:16.913 --> 01:46:22.417
is actually in a melting pot
of many species throughout the galaxy.

1787
01:46:22.418 --> 01:46:25.003
What I expect to come out of that is.

1788
01:46:25.004 --> 01:46:28.799
first of all. a greater appreciation
of what it means to be a human.

1789
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:34.096
And to me. that kind of change
on the human character

1790
01:46:34.097 --> 01:46:38.642
is probably more significant
than what we can learn about

1791
01:46:38.643 --> 01:46:41.520
atoms and molecules
and propulsion systems.

1792
01:46:41.521 --> 01:46:43.814
My grandchildren are going to grow up

1793
01:46:43.815 --> 01:46:46.441
taking into account
and thinking about the fact

1794
01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:49.694
that the universe.
uh.  is full of life.

1795
01:46:49.695 --> 01:46:54.324
We're on the threshold
of an entirely different understanding

1796
01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:57.119
of the universe
and our place within it

1797
01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:01.414
and technological opportunities
and possibilities

1798
01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:05.210
that were the stuff of science fiction
just a few years ago.

1799
01:47:05.211 --> 01:47:07.337
The people behind the Legacy Program

1800
01:47:07.338 --> 01:47:10.465
truly believe
that the secret is so intense

1801
01:47:10.466 --> 01:47:13.176
that they can't share it
with the American people.

1802
01:47:13.177 --> 01:47:17.097
There may be aspects of this
that are so intense they can't share it.

1803
01:47:17.098 --> 01:47:20.892
However. I think the basic fact
that we are not alone in the universe.

1804
01:47:20.893 --> 01:47:22.561
we can share that
with the American people.

1805
01:47:22.562 --> 01:47:24.062
We can handle it at this point.

1806
01:47:24.063 --> 01:47:27.732
Hopefully one day. the American people
will learn the bigger story

1807
01:47:27.733 --> 01:47:29.317
and how it impacts us all.

1808
01:47:29.318 --> 01:47:32.612
I want to tell the American people
what I know.

1809
01:47:32.613 --> 01:47:36.533
but I can't because a vast majority
of it remains highly classified.

1810
01:47:36.534 --> 01:47:39.661
I feel tremendous pressure
to share what I can

1811
01:47:39.662 --> 01:47:41.997
because I know there will come a time

1812
01:47:41.998 --> 01:47:44.792
where we all wish
we had done things differently.

1813
01:47:46.127 --> 01:47:50.630
That moment is imminent.
and when that moment comes.

1814
01:47:50.631 --> 01:47:54.677
I know people will say. "I wish
somebody would've told me sooner."

1815
01:47:57.555 --> 01:48:00.640
<i>Remember. as far as we've come.</i>

1816
01:48:00.641 --> 01:48:05.103
<i>we are still only just beginning
the greatest paradigm shift</i>

1817
01:48:05.104 --> 01:48:09.567
<i>in human history.
the age of disclosure.</i>
