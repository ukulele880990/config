00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.456
What do you mean. "safe"?

544
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:20.126
I don't know.

545
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.838
Do you... do you even
like it there?

546
00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:31.679
What difference does it make?

547
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.598
A pretty big one. I think.

548
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.897
I need to sleep.

549
00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:44.275
Oh.

550
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.152
Yeah. me too.

551
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.028
I should. uh...

552
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:57.538
So. uh. I'm off.

553
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.041
Goodbye. Hollander.

554
00:41:13.512 --> 00:41:15.764
(Door closing)

555
00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:30.738
(Elevator beeping)

556
00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:19.203
Fuck.
