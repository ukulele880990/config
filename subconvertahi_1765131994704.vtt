00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.522
At long last.

8
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.192
we can begin.

9
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.846
You and I.

10
00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:31.562
we are going to do
such beautiful things together. William.

11
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.609
Such beautiful things.

12
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.042
Holly.

13
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.211
Holly!

14
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.838
Holly!

15
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.507
I've been calling you.

16
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.674
I'm sorry.

17
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.259
Could you round up the troops?

18
00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.972
Breakfast!

19
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.516
Coming!

20
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.393
{\an8}Nance. come on.

21
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.306
{\an8}Let me in.
or I'm gonna whiz on the floor right here.

22
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.732
{\an8}Sorry. Mrs. Byers.

23
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.109
{\an8}Whiz away.

24
00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:42.944
{\an8}Wow.

25
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.030
{\an8}Shit.

26
00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:48.908
{\an8}Breakfast!

27
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.412
{\an8}Shit. dude. we overslept.

28
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.081
{\an8}-I thought you were setting an alarm.
-I thought you were.

29
00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:04.674
-It's not always Jonathan's fault.
-It's always Jonathan's...

30
00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.843
It wasn't my fault. I told you...

31
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.762
{\an8}Holly. can you pass the bacon?

32
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.348
Holly! Bacon!

33
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.937
-You need to just drop it.
-Whatever you want.

34
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.231
You don't need it. You're crazy. huh?

35
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.777
Karen. do you have any Midol upstairs?

36
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.033
{\an8}Nancy. dishes in the sink.

37
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.412
{\an8}Be back at 5:00 or 6:00. Let me know
if you need me to pick up anything.

38
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.872
{\an8}-Boogie!
-Come on. Hurry up.

39
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.791
{\an8}-I'm coming.
-Holly. your jacket.

40
00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.459
{\an8}-Here. Don't forget it.
-Thank you.

41
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.418
{\an8}Hug.

42
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:41.335
{\an8}-Bye.
-Bye.

43
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.088
I'm sorry. I can't help clean up.
I'm running late.

44
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.799
{\an8}It's okay. Joyce. really. I understand.

45
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.218
{\an8}How much longer?

46
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.723
{\an8}What do you want me to do. Ted. huh?
Kick 'em to the street?

47
00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:55.892
{\an8}Is that an option?

48
00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:03.566
Hey. wait up! Wait up!

49
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.109
Come on. we gotta go!

50
00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.991
The Morning Squawk. Mike.
we're gonna miss it!

51
00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:15.912
<i>Good morning. Hawkins!
This is WSQK The Squawk!</i>

52
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:17.580
That's a new one.

53
00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.749
<i>It's looking like a regular day
in Hawkins.</i>

54
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.001
<i>Fifty-five degrees. low chance of rain.</i>

55
00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:25.713
<i>medium chance of arrest.
high chance of helicopters.</i>

56
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:29.592
But general banality aside.
it's an exciting day for me.

57
00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.261
your friend. entertainer. and DJ.
Robin Buckley...

58
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.223
Nice to meet you! ...AKA Rockin' Robin.

59
00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.558
{\an8}And why is it a big day for me. you ask?

60
00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.228
Well. it's my 500th broadcast.

61
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.648
Yeah. you heard that right. folks.
Five-double-O!

62
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.233
Which means it's been even longer

63
00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.153
since you've heard the sultry voice
of Jimmy "Fast Hands" Lee.

64
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:53.074
But while Jimmy was fleeing Hawkins
even faster than he moves those hands.

65
00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:57.245
yours truly was watching slack-jawed
as the earth split open beneath her feet

66
00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.456
and coughed up that tsunami
of mysterious dandruff.

67
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.502
<i>And now. I'm stuck here with you.
my fellow quarantine compatriots.</i>

68
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:08.506
<i>And if I can be brutally honest.
I couldn't be happier.</i>

69
00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:13.594
<i>Because when you really think about it.
why would you want to live anywhere else?</i>

70
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.264
<i>I mean. what town on Earth can match</i>

71
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:20.059
<i>our very impressive
military-to-civilian ratio?</i>

72
00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.313
And those free.
mandatory medical checkups?

73
00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.815
I mean. very cool.

74
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.193
'Cause after we inhaled
those springtime snowflakes.

75
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.527
who knows what's wrong with us?

76
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.238
{\an8}Maybe we're fine. maybe not.

77
00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:33.739
No one knows for sure.

78
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:39.036
After all. this was a "natural phenomenon
never before seen by man."

79
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.126
<i>A phenomenon now covered up
by a giant metal Band-Aid.</i>

80
00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:48.713
<i>Quite the eyesore.
but hey. great for sledding.</i>

81
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:53.092
<i>Though seriously. kids. stop sledding
on the giant steel Band-Aid.</i>

82
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.637
<i>You are going to kill yourselves.
Also. the men with guns.</i>

83
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.973
-Go. go. go. go. go!
-<i>They don't like it. not one bit.</i>

84
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.893
<i>While we're on the subject
of things not to do.</i>

85
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:06.314
<i>please steer clear
of the Military Access Control Zone.</i>

86
00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:10.568
<i>aka the MAC-Z.
or as I like to call it. the Big Mac.</i>

87
00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:13.362
<i>I have no idea what's going on in there.</i>

88
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.489
<i>but I have a gut feeling</i>

89
00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:19.660
<i>there's a pretty good reason
they'd like you to stay away.</i>

90
00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:23.039
But hey. the rest of Hawkins
is still there for you to enjoy.

91
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.541
Someday soon.
they're gonna let us out of here.

92
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.460
In the meantime.
be thankful this is your home.

93
00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:31.047
study for that test.
enjoy that TV dinner. and go on that date.

94
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.426
Which. by the way. is exactly
what yours truly is doing tonight.

95
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:39.013
That's right. Rockin' Robin has a date.
ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.268
And now. who is this lucky someone?

97
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.646
Well. don't be so nosy. kids.

98
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.065
They know who they are.

99
00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:53.319
That is. if you're listening.
which I hope you are.

100
00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:56.906
Because this next one. it's for you. babe.

101
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.165
What the hell?

102
00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.922
Whoa. What's going on?
What the hell? What the hell?

103
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.051
I told you to stop thumbing your nose
at the military.

104
00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:20.388
I was reiterating their goddamn rules.
encouraging compliance.

105
00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:23.141
-Right. No sarcasm there.
-Said the dingus with the rubber chicken.

106
00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:27.311
-These are very serious people. Robin.
-Shit. shit. shit. shit. shit!

107
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.066
Henderson. you copy? Henderson?

108
00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:33.526
Yeah. I copy.

109
00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:37.029
God. you sound swell.
Let me take a wild guess.

110
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.906
You're not calling
to wish me good morning.

111
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:42.326
It's not exactly a good morning.
We've got a situation at the Squawk.

112
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.495
The signal. it's... it's gone all wonky.

113
00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:46.372
I think Robin finally pissed 'em off.

114
00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:48.624
Doubtful. She was encouraging compliance.

115
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.709
Told you!

116
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.919
The remote radio head's
the more likely culprit.

117
00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.088
<i>-The remote what?</i>
-Just read the manual. Steve.

118
00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:55.840
That thing might as well be in Greek.

119
00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:56.799
<i>Then learn Greek!</i>

120
00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:59.858
I can't always be there
to solve your problems for you. Steve.

121
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.470
Henderson?

122
00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.098
God!

123
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.642
"Learn Greek." You heard that tone.

124
00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.103
You heard that. right?

125
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.822
Watch it.

126
00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:29.832
What'd I tell you about that shirt. freak?

127
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.586
Andy asked you a question. freak.
You deaf or what?

128
00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.633
For his sake. I hope he is.
because I thought I was pretty damn clear

129
00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.677
when I said
I didn't wanna see you in that shirt.

130
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.387
You also told me
to stop screwing your mom.

131
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.031
and that didn't stop me. did it?

132
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.476
-Something funny. Henderson?
-Let go.

133
00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:50.811
Hellfire is over. you hear me?

134
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.605
Let go.

135
00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:54.940
Or what? What are you gonna do?

136
00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.444
Stop! Andy! Stop!

137
00:12:58.527 --> 00:12:59.403
Hey!

138
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:06.744
Well. well.

139
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.996
If it isn't the traitor.

140
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.753
Remember that time
my sister kicked your balls so hard.

141
00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:17.213
you limped for a week?

142
00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:19.983
Yeah. if you touch Dustin again.

143
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.010
I'll kick 'em so hard
they'll pop like water balloons.

144
00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:24.637
I say kick away.

145
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.264
Stop this meathead from reproducing

146
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.420
and further infecting the world
with his unique brand of idiocy.

147
00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:38.359
Hope you brought a change of clothes.
No one wants to see that shit.

148
00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:51.247
You've gotta stop
provoking them. man.

149
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.123
Oh. so this is my fault?

150
00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:56.085
-For what? Wearing a T-shirt?
-You know it's more than a T-shirt.

151
00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.045
I can't be like you
and turn the other cheek

152
00:13:58.128 --> 00:14:00.882
while they spread their bullshit
about Hellfire. about Eddie.

153
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.091
Eddie never gave a rat's ass

154
00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.469
about what those mouth breathers
were saying about him.

155
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.221
What he would care about
is finding and killing Vecna.

156
00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:11.350
Do you seriously think
I don't care about that. Mike? Really?

157
00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.936
I think you're fighting two battles.
You need to be fighting one.

158
00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:16.814
Mike's right. Dustin.
What if you get seriously hurt?

159
00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:18.191
You're drawing attention.

160
00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.777
Remember what Hop said.
We need to keep our heads down.

161
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.614
-Follow the rules. Blend in.
-Stay focused on our next crawl.

162
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.449
Do you even hear yourselves right now?

163
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:30.035
Blend in? Follow the rules?
That's not what we've ever done.

164
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.413
-Jesus Christ.
-We stay true to ourselves.

165
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.457
We're supposed to stay true
to our friends.

166
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.585
We stand up for what's right.
no matter the cost.

167
00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:38.878
You're not listening to us.

168
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.130
No. <i>you're</i> not.

169
00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.590
Dustin!

170
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.939
-Unbelievable.
-Let him go.

171
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:16.832
Come on.

172
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:17.833
Move. move!

173
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.393
You're a fast little shit. huh?

174
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.276
It's not her.

175
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.029
Another goddamn burnout. sir.

176
00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:50.532
Get her out of here.

177
00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:56.246
Shit!

178
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:33.033
Twelve minutes. 33 seconds.

179
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.326
It's a new record.

180
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:40.582
So? How are we feeling?

181
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.542
Okay.

182
00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.043
Okay?

183
00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.963
Come on. that was 12:33!

184
00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:47.423
It's four seconds too slow.

185
00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.717
I lost one second on the climb.
two seconds at the log.

186
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.136
-Hey.
-I can make my bus jump sooner.

187
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:55.305
That'll save me two more seconds.
That gets me under 12:30.

188
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:58.017
El. you have to take it easy on yourself.

189
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.783
-You think Henry's going easy?
-You know what I think?

190
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.815
I think we still have
some more of that waffle mix.

191
00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:09.737
And I think we should celebrate
this record time with a stack of those.

192
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.658
And then maybe we could watch
a <i>Miami Vice</i> marathon.

193
00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.454
I can beat the time. Reset it.

194
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.499
If you're tired.
you're gonna injure yourself.

195
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:22.416
Reset it!

196
00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:42.936
Heads up!

197
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.741
Hey. hey. How you doing?

198
00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:59.787
Austin Millbarge. ID 4528-niner.

199
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.997
That's me.

200
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.100
I swear to God.
this stupid thing does not exist.

201
00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.519
-Can someone try Dustin again?
-He turned off his walkie.

202
00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:25.646
-What's up with him lately?
-Don't get me started.

203
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:26.897
Yeah. please don't.

204
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.148
-Hey!
-Huh?

205
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:30.025
Got it.

206
00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:37.199
Wait. wait. wait. There it is. yeah.

207
00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.700
Remote radio head. yeah.

208
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.039
And. uh. where exactly are we gonna find
this remote thingamajig?

209
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:52.172
I don't see it.

210
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.758
It's up there somewhere.

211
00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:55.926
It's gotta be.

212
00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:01.557
So. I guess somebody's gotta climb
to the tippy top of this bad boy and...

213
00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:06.353
Without a harness or anything.
it seems kind of dangerous.

214
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:10.065
AKA job for good old Steve Harrington.

215
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.984
-No third person. please.
-All right.

216
00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:13.443
I. uh...

217
00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.738
I actually think this might be
a better job for Jonathan Byers.

218
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:21.201
I'm like one quarter monkey. dude.
I got this. Byers. Don't sweat it.

219
00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.205
Uh. voltage!

220
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.915
Unless you wanna fry.

221
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.000
Yeah. I know.

222
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.294
I'm not an idiot.

223
00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.391
Whoa. dude. what are you doing?

224
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.352
I got this. dude. Don't sweat it.

225
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.812
Son of a...

226
00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:03.577
What is it about your presence
that brings out their inner Neanderthal?

227
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.582
I thought grocery delivery
wasn't till tomorrow.

228
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.417
Me too.

229
00:20:13.837 --> 00:20:15.631
Ah. come on. Come on.

230
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:36.777
Shit.

231
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.823
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

232
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.622
Found ya.

233
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:54.461
Never fails.

234
00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.297
-I fixed it!
-I fixed it!

235
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:07.599
All right.

236
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.771
Santa's brought a full sack today.

237
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.404
A fresh telemetry tag.
Scarcer than hen's teeth. these things.

238
00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.243
Enough bullets and shells
for Hop to start a small war.

239
00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:28.537
if he should so choose.

240
00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:31.415
Anyone order a salad?

241
00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:34.126
Grenade salad?

242
00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:37.462
I hid the grenades under the. uh. lettuce.

243
00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.256
Okay.

244
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.467
Gatorade for El's battery.

245
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:43.802
Did someone say Gatorade?

246
00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.263
-Let me get one. Thanks.
-Sure.

247
00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:49.016
But I don't think
it's gonna go too well with...

248
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:51.810
peanut butter!

249
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:54.604
Boppers! God. I missed these things.

250
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.647
Thanks.

251
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.024
Don't worry. Mr. Byers.
I got you a present too.

252
00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:00.402
I know you're allergic to jazz.

253
00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:04.364
but just give it a whirl.
I think you'll find it quite engaging.

254
00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:10.954
And for the station manager.
the reason for my premature delivery.

255
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.171
A burn? Tonight? But that's...

256
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.297
Too soon. I know.

257
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.926
Whatever they're doing in the Upside Down
evidently needs serious resources.

258
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.470
That's a lot of cargo.

259
00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:31.016
I figure a supply drop this big
takes two hours. minimum.

260
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:33.560
Which gives Hopper
plenty of time for a crawl.

261
00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:38.982
Maybe tonight's the night
we finally find that bastard and end this.

262
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.013
Hey there. Jake.

263
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.402
You up for a little field trip?

264
00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:19.272
I'm telling you. he's lost his mind.

265
00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:21.566
He told me
he wanted to start Hellfire again.

266
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.318
What? When did he say that?

267
00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:27.155
This weekend. He was talking
about finding the lost sheep.

268
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.116
And we thought the shirt was bad.

269
00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:31.827
I'm telling you. he's lost his damn mind.

270
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.329
Who's lost his damn mind?

271
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.623
-Uh. the...
-Andy!

272
00:23:36.706 --> 00:23:37.583
-Andy!
-Andy.

273
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.126
-Andy lost his mind.
-Yeah.

274
00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.961
Like when he came at you this morning.

275
00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:42.629
-Yeah. that was...
-Messed up.

276
00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:43.630
Yeah.

277
00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:45.340
It's rude.

278
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.430
<i>Hey there. friends. this is Rockin' Robin.</i>

279
00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:54.224
<i>Sorry about the abrupt departure.
I hope you survived without me.</i>

280
00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:57.352
We had some annoying
technical difficulties.

281
00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:02.107
But to make it up to you.
we have a very special treat

282
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.360
that's sure to turn
your day upside down...

283
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:08.321
-Holy shit.
-Already?

284
00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:09.489
Paper! Give me paper!

285
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:12.993
Come on! Will. hurry up!

286
00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:15.620
<i>♪ You're giving love instinctively ♪</i>

287
00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:19.374
<i>Before you start bumping.
here's a few fun facts about the Boss.</i>

288
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:22.377
She was born Diane
in the North End of Detroit.

289
00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:26.673
<i>Berry Gordy. that's Gordy with a G.
signed her to Motown in 1961.</i>

290
00:24:26.756 --> 00:24:28.675
<i>And one is the key number.</i>

291
00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.677
because between 1964 and '67.

292
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.430
the Supremes had ten songs
hit the top of the charts.

293
00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:34.973
<i>That's right. ten.</i>

294
00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:38.143
Then in '78. she tried to make it big
in the movies with <i>The Wiz.</i>

295
00:24:38.226 --> 00:24:40.353
which was a colossal flop-a-roonie.

296
00:24:40.437 --> 00:24:43.148
But. in my personal opinion.
I still dig it.

297
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:44.983
Michael Jackson as a scarecrow?

298
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.443
<i>Give it a chance.</i>

299
00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:48.445
But make sure you bring
your super-sized popcorn.

300
00:24:48.528 --> 00:24:51.990
because this movie has a run time
of over two hours.

301
00:24:52.073 --> 00:24:53.742
<i>All right. class dismissed.</i>

302
00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:56.703
I hope you were taking notes.
There will be a test later.

303
00:24:56.786 --> 00:24:57.787

318
00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:58.765
So. assuming Murray's intel is correct.

319
00:25:58.848 --> 00:26:02.310
the supply convoy is set
to reach Hawkins at 10:00 sharp.

320
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.729
Meaning I want Hopper in the tunnels

321
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:07.524
and en route to MAC-Z no later than 9:00.

322
00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:09.818
Lucas. we'll take
our usual observation post.

323
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.820
Barring unusual traffic.

324
00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.406
I expect the convoy
to reach MAC-Z at 10:15.

325
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:16.450
Once the burn starts
and there's sufficient cover.

326
00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:18.582
we'll signal Hopper. who'll make his move.

327
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.246
And now the crawl begins.

328
00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:23.623
Hop is now in the Upside Down.

329
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:26.751
traveling at what I hope to be
a gentle 30 miles an hour.

330
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:27.669
which will allow...

331
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.047
...you and Harrington to follow along
in the Rightside Up.

332
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.674
Just remember. try and keep
the telemetry signal within...

333
00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:35.802
Negative 60 and negative 70 dB.
Easy-peasy.

334
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:38.388
I expect the convoy
to take the same route as last month.

335
00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:40.557
Main to Cornwallis. one turn.

336
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.351
But if you guys hit any red lights...

337
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.603
-I'll blow through.
-Only if there's no MPs around.

338
00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:48.732
Remember. if you guys get pulled over.
we lose Hop. we're toast.

339
00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:49.899
I got it.

340
00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:53.111
You're gonna travel up Cornwallis
for about six miles.

341
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.156
And as the convoy reaches
this Shell station here...

342
00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:57.866
We radio Hop to disembark.

343
00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:00.118
Which will drop the old man
at the border of G1.

344
00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:05.540
Where he'll have two whole hours
to search for Vecna. which is ample time.

345
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.876
He's cleared zones much faster.

346
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:12.547
So. all in all.
signs point to another successful crawl.

347
00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:15.884
Is there a problem?

348
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.136
Um...

349
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.057
No. No. I mean. I think it's good.

350
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.018
Yeah. yeah. it's good. It's really good.

351
00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:26.102
It's just. um...

352
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:30.106
Zone G1 is not that exciting or Vecna-y.

353
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.985
What does it have? A Circuit
City. a couple of houses. and a...

354
00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:37.072
Big Buy? What are the chances
Vecna's shopping for Lucky Charms?

355
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.907
It doesn't matter. We stick to the plan.

356
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.785
We break into the Upside Down
the only way we can.

357
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:44.121
through the MAC-Z gate.
under the cover of a burn.

358
00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:47.082
Once inside. we search
one zone at a time. methodically.

359
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.214
until we figure out
where he's been hiding.

360
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.669
Unless...

361
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.088
he's already dead.

362
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:55.490
Again. your plan is great. It's just...

363
00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:58.343
This is crawl what? Are we in the 30s now?

364
00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:00.036
And not a single baddie in sight?

365
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.138
El can't find him in her bath.

366
00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:04.808
and Will hasn't had his goosies
since the shake 'n' quake.

367
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:06.643
-Goosies?
-And last we saw Vecna.

368
00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:08.854
he was roasting like a turkey
and pumped full of lead.

369
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:10.606
That was before he fell three stories.

370
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.982
So you ever think
we're scouring a battlefield

371
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:15.735
that we already. like. won?

372
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.863
Have you forgotten what he showed Nancy?
Hawkins on fire.

373
00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:21.199
-Karen. Holly. everyone dead.
-Yeah. man.

374
00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:24.453
He also showed Max her brother
walking around with a hole in his chest.

375
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.039
That's what he does. He gets in your head
and tries to scare you.

376
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:30.792
He did a good job because I am scared.
And you should be scared too.

377
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:34.046
Because if he's still out there.
he's planning to end our world. so...

378
00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:37.674
We don't stop looking.
Even if it takes 100 more crawls. 1.000.

379
00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:39.634
We don't stop until we're goddamn sure

380
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:44.681
that wrinkled. nose less. rotting bastard
is dead and gone and never coming back.

381
00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:47.183
Everyone in?

382
00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.402
I want to see Vecna's heart on a platter.

383
00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.748
Just wish I could do it myself.

384
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:01.906
For Eddie.

385
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.199
-For Eddie.
-For Eddie.

386
00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:06.494
On three. "kill Vecna." One. two. three.

387
00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.579
Kill Vecna!

388
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.124
Oh no!

389
00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:16.296
-Military man.
-Wanted to see if you had my back.

390
00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:19.466
Yeah. I have your back.

391
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:55.960
-Will!
-Will!

392
00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:57.045
Will!

393
00:29:57.545 --> 00:29:59.964
-Hey. are you okay?
-Yeah. it's okay. I'm fine.

394
00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:01.800
Was it him? Was it Vecna?

395
00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:04.052
I don't know.
I just had this crazy feeling.

396
00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.346
and then the sky was spinning. and...

397
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.058
I don't know.
I guess maybe it's nothing. right?

398
00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:12.685
I don't know.

399
00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:16.314
Maybe I just get nervous sometimes
before crawls.

400
00:30:16.397 --> 00:30:18.191
Yeah. I... I get nervous too.

401
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:20.902
But the sky doesn't spin for me.

402
00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.779
It ever spin for you?

403
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:24.906
Maybe he's close.

404
00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.663
Okay. Squawk. six o'clock.
not a second later. right?

405
00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:32.831
-Six o'clock.
-Are you okay?

406
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:33.832
-Yeah.
-You sure?

407
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:35.792
-Take it slow.
-Okay. yeah.

408
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.594
I'm just trying to get it started.
Ready? Here we go. Come on.

409
00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:51.349
I just gotta get this going.
and then we're gonna have lots of fun.

410
00:30:51.432 --> 00:30:53.059
Blast off!

411
00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:54.686
Derek. stop! Come on! Get off!

412
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:56.605
-Derek. stop!
-Hold on tight!

413
00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.148
-Go away! Derek!
-Try not to puke!

414
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:00.316
Stop!

415
00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:03.319
-Jerk face!
-Bite me.

416
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.737
You okay? Come here.

417
00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:06.614
Let's get you off.

418
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.575
Oh my... Careful. careful!

419
00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:10.034
You okay?

420
00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:12.871
All right. my dears. playtime's over.

421
00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:14.998
Come on.

422
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:17.917
What is with that grumpy face?

423
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:23.965
Come on. we have books to read.
art to create. wisdom to unlock.

424
00:31:27.343 --> 00:31:28.344
Holly?

425
00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:32.932
Hi.

426
00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:36.853
And she can tell Derek
to go away too.

427
00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:38.980
He <i>is</i> a jerk face.

428
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.983
Oh yeah. Miss Harris gave me...

429
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:48.392
But she also said
it wasn't really my fault.

430
00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:23.399
Are you just
going to stand there. Sergeant Ramirez.

431
00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:25.902
or did you have something to report?

432
00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:27.236
Sorry. Dr. Kay.

433
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.614
Yes. Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan.

434
00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:31.783
he tracked down
that lead we spoke about. and...

435
00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:34.327
It was a tremendous success.

436
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.079
No. unfortunately.

437
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:39.624
I see
they don't teach sarcasm in the ROTC.

438
00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:46.130
If it was good news.
Sullivan would be here himself.

439
00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:49.467
with trumpets and confetti.
I have no doubt.

440
00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:53.429
Don't worry. It doesn't bite.

441
00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:56.265
It does. on occasion. strangle.

442
00:32:58.351 --> 00:32:59.727
Was there anything else?

443
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:03.564
A new lead. perhaps.
to offer more false hope?

444
00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:04.941
Not yet. Doctor.

445
00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:09.779
Sergeant.

446
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:16.077
Please tell your commander
that I am running into a wall here.

447
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.038
People are dying. innocent people.

448
00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:22.667
I need the girl.

449
00:33:49.402 --> 00:33:50.987
The last run. what was my time?

450
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:55.283
I'm not sure. I didn't see.
I was distracted by Diana Ross.

451
00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.993
I saved four seconds.

452
00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:58.453
Highly doubt that.

453
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.246
No. no. it was very fast.

454
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:03.124
One second on the climb.
one with the log. two on the bus.

455
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.335
Great. You did that today.
You can do it again tomorrow.

456
00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:09.213
The crawl is tonight. Hop.
If I'm under 12:30. I can come with you.

457
00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:12.759
-That is what you promised.
-Yeah. I promised that. I promised it.

458
00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:14.635
But I didn't see it.

459
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.764
So blame Diana.

460
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.447
You didn't think
I could make the time. did you?

461
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.617
I think you can. but no. not today.
I don't think you made that time.

462
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.202
Are you saying that I lie?

463
00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:41.037
No. I'm saying you're mistaken.

464
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.622
I'm not mistaken.

465
00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:45.374
Okay. so you're on
your sixth run.

466
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.794
you're totally drained.

467
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:52.548
and you just happen to break
your second record of the day.

468
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.217
right before a crawl.

469
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.426
I don't think so. kid.

470
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.514
You saw the time. I saw you look down.
You have to let me go with you.

471
00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:01.516
You want to find Henry so bad. don't you?

472
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.517
So bad.

473
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.560
Do it. Do it from the tub.

474
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.437
Do it remotely.

475
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.857
You're not coming with me. Not today.

476
00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:11.651
End of story.

477
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.457
Why are you being so hard on her?

478
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.584
I'm not being hard on her.

479
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.171
She's just trying to help.

480
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:33.715
It'd be great if Will could help.

481
00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:36.259
but you keep that kid
wrapped in bubble wrap.

482
00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.302
Come on. That's different.

483
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:39.762
I mean. El...

484
00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:43.057
Look at her. She's... She's ready.

485
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.852
Thirty-seven crawls.

486
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:49.188
The only thing I found
down in that damn place are soldiers.

487
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:50.189
lots of them.

488
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:52.608
And they're all looking
for one person. El.

489
00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:56.321
So there's no reason to put her life
on the line and bring her down there.

490
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:59.407
especially not for some recon mission.

491
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.661
Well. if it's just some recon mission.
then what's with all the guns?

492
00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.955
It's in case I run into trouble.

493
00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:08.166
-Yeah. or in case you run into him.
-No.

494
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.170
I run into that psychic freak.
I'm tucking tail and running.

495
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:17.049
I'm nuts. I'm nuts. But I'm not that nuts.

496
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:26.434
I'm gonna need El.
I know that. I know that.

497
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:30.938
Which is precisely why
there's no point in risking her life

498
00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:34.192
over some stupid recon crap.

499
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:41.282
I want her primed. but I want her safe.
Safe until the very last minute. okay?

500
00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.535
Yeah. okay.

501
00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:49.290
But her time on that last run.

502
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.791
did she make it?

503
00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:54.128
With a second to spare.

504
00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.712
See what Donna was wearing?

505
00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:38.673
She's gone up like two sizes
since last year.

506
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.883
-Yeah. right.
-Jesus Christ!

507
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.010
Oh my God.

508
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.515
It's just a corn snake. dude.
Guys. it's just a corn snake.

509
00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.559
You're a pussy. dude.

510
00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:53.667
-Did you piss your pants?
-It's just a snake.

511
00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.056
Hey. Andy. is that your new pet?

512
00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:58.077
Don't scare him.

513
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.462
Holly!

514
00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:20.881
Holly!

515
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:30.850
Holly.

516
00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:34.562
What are you doing?
Come on. I have to get going.

517
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.022
Sorry.

518
00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.066
They told me to wait.

519
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:55.916
Is this about your mystery friend again?

520
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.543
Mr. Whatsit?

521
00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.881
He's only trying to help.

522
00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:04.342
Help? How?

523
00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.510
By protecting me.

524
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:10.931
He says that there are
monsters in Hawkins.

525
00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.977
and... they like to eat kids like me.

526
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.688
Monsters aren't real. Holly.

527
00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.358
I don't believe you.

528
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.606
I know you're scared
because of everything that's happened.

529
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.034
With the crazy stories people tell.
I mean. I get scared sometimes too.

530
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:31.160
No. you don't.

531
00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:32.370
Are you kidding?

532
00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:34.455
Everyone in Hawkins is scared shitless.

533
00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.291
Anyone who says they aren't
are full of it.

534
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:39.585
Like that mouth breather in your class...
What's his name again?

535
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:41.587
-Derek?
-Yeah. Derek.

536
00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:44.173
He probably wets his bed every night.

537
00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:49.053
Know who I turn to when I get scared?

538
00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.730
Mike the Brave.

539
00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:02.608
He goes on adventures
called dungeon crawls.

540
00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:04.276
What's a dungeon crawl?

541
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.904
Basically. he explores
these underground worlds.

542
00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:10.699
where he fights monsters.
evil wizards. sorcerers and stuff.

543
00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:13.327
But Mike the Brave is never scared.

544
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:17.373
So whenever I'm feeling
frightened or nervous.

545
00:40:17.456 --> 00:40:19.333
I just imagine that he's at my side.

546
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:20.418
and I feel better.

547
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:25.047
So maybe the next time you get scared.
you don't need this Mr. Whatsit.

548
00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:28.801
Maybe you just need Holly the Heroic.

549
00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:31.262
Holly the Heroic?

550
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.826
I was gonna to wait a
few more years. but...

551
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:47.778
She's a cleric.
which means she has divine powers.

552
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.365
She can cast spells of protection
to ward against evil spirits.

553
00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:53.742
and even cooler.
she can cast a dimension door.

554
00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:56.167
which can teleport you
to anywhere you visualize.

555
00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:58.706
I mean. come on.

556
00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.041
Can this lame-o Mr. Whatsit
do any of this?

557
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.043
No.

558
00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:07.965
She'll keep you safe. I promise.

559
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.680
<i>It was this weird feeling.</i>

560
00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:18.350
<i>Like something
I really haven't felt before.</i>

561
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.979
Mike thinks it could mean
that maybe Vecna's close.

562
00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:24.857
that he's finally re-emerged.

563
00:41:25.357 --> 00:41:29.028
And if he has.
maybe we'll find him tonight.

564
00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:33.616
What do you think. Lucas?

565
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:38.913
Yeah. I think
we'll find him this time for sure.

566
00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:43.292
You wanna play the tape?

567
00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:45.878
I'm gonna go grab a Coke
or something caffeinated.

568
00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:48.130
because it's gonna be a long night.

569
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:49.381
You want one?

570
00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:51.800
No. I'm good. Thanks.

571
00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:34.426
Robin!

572
00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:37.012
Rockin' Robin!

573
00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:44.478
Okay. So I have good news.
and I have bad news.

574
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:45.771
What are you doing here?

575
00:42:45.854 --> 00:42:48.357
A good friend once said.
"Bad news first. always."

576
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.818
So I have to cancel our date tonight.

577
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:52.653
Of course.

578
00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:56.365
But the good news is
I made us a reservation.

579
00:42:56.448 --> 00:42:59.368
8:00 p.m. tomorrow night at Enzo's.

580
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.332
Enzo's? Okay. how exactly
are we gonna be able to afford that?

581
00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:07.543
You mean how am <i>I</i> going to afford it?

582
00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:09.772
Because you. my dear.
are paying for nothing.

583
00:43:10.379 --> 00:43:11.380
Double how. then?

584
00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:13.841
I stole money off the dead guy
they just wheeled out.

585
00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.676
That's not funny.
His name was Mr. Pentergast.

586
00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:16.719
and he was very nice.

587
00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:18.053
And very rich.

588
00:43:18.137 --> 00:43:21.849
-Robin...
-Look. dinner's on me. okay?

589
00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:26.645
But. uh. maybe for dessert.
I could... I could see you in this hat.

590
00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:29.023
and. like. only this hat.

591
00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:32.484
I hate you. I...

592
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:43.162
Was that on purpose?

593
00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:45.581
-Totally.
-That's so sexy.

594
00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:50.419
So. there any chance
I could get you to wear this outfit?

595
00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:51.462
But that's...

596
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:03.265
Who is that?

597
00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:04.725
Shit.

598
00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:33.212
Don't worry. Eddie.
Eventually they'll get bored.

599
00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.794
You should really keep a better eye
on your pets. Henderson.

600
00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:17.756
It's dangerous out there.
They shouldn't be left alone like that.

601
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.551
Hey there. freak. Long time no see.

602
00:45:20.634 --> 00:45:21.635
Hiya.

603
00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:31.520
Something funny. Henderson?

604
00:45:31.603 --> 00:45:34.064
No. I... I was just thinking.

605
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.233
In Eddie's last campaign.

606
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.988
I defeated Vecna's lead acolyte
by casting Prismatic Spray.

607
00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:44.158
One D8 turned up a 7.

608
00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:45.784
Violet.

609
00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:49.197
Is that supposed to be English. freak?

610
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:53.959
Well. violet Prismatic Spray
is the deadliest. You know why?

611
00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.463
It causes blindness.

612
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.091
Hey!

613
00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:31.369
Hellfire dies with you. Henderson.

614
00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.040
And it dies tonight.

615
00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:50.390
<i>Dustin. this is Lucas.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

616
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:53.060
<i>Dustin. do you copy? Over.</i>

617
00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:57.397
Dustin. you're an hour late. man.
You're making us nervous.

618
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.191
We need you here at the Squawk.

619
00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:02.444
Dustin. if you can hear us.
please respond. Over.

620
00:47:02.528 --> 00:47:04.864
I got off the phone with his mom.
She hasn't heard from him.

621
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:07.616
-Christ. Henderson.
-He'll show. He always shows.

622
00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:08.617
Try him again.

623
00:47:09.117 --> 00:47:11.745
Come in. Dustin. Are you there?
Earth to Dustin.

624
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:13.998
This is serious. man. Quit playing.
We can't wait around.

625
00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:19.336
Get your ass to the Squawk.

626
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:21.547
We can't wait around.
We need you here now.

627
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.298
This is not funny. Are you there?

628
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.176
Dustin. is everything okay?

629
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:29.680
-<i>Do you think Dustin is okay?</i>
-Dustin!

630
00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:31.598
I hope so.

631
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.476
He was acting weird today.

632
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:37.145
Weird how?

633
00:47:37.729 --> 00:47:42.150
Just angry. scared. reckless. Not himself.

634
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.820
Hopper's the same.

635
00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.697
Not himself.

636
00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:52.619
Maybe it's just getting to us. you know?

637
00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:56.832
Being... Being stuck in here.
not knowing where Vecna is.

638
00:47:56.915 --> 00:47:58.041
no end in sight.

639
00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.836
I mean. we're really starting to lose it.

640
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:03.797
I mean. we really need to catch a break.

641
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.135
And maybe we will.
Because earlier. Will had a feeling.

642
00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.388
-If Will has a feeling...
-Then it means something.

643
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:13.640
So... So. maybe tonight's our break.

644
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:15.142
Maybe even our last crawl.

645
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.854
We find Vecna.
and we end this once and for all.

646
00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.901
And then what happens?

647
00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:26.904
You mean after you totally demolish Vecna?

648
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:32.284
In my campaigns. if the party wins.
then they all live happily ever after.

649
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.953
Happily how?

650
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:40.792
Well. usually what happens is the party
doesn't return to their local village.

651
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:42.753
because too much has happened.

652
00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:44.880
They've seen too much.

653
00:48:44.963 --> 00:48:48.216
So they travel to a faraway land.
a... a peaceful land.

654
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.137
somewhere beautiful.
with like three waterfalls or something.

655
00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:55.557
and they all start again. together.

656
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.188
Do you think that could be real for us?

657
00:49:01.813 --> 00:49:03.690
Yeah. of course.

658
00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:09.821
I mean. not the three waterfalls part.
But the other stuff. yeah. of course.

659
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:14.451
If Vecna's gone. then what's stopping us?

660
00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:19.373
Hey. lovebirds! Chief's almost ready.

661
00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:21.625
Let's do this. Come on.

662
00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:36.515
Thank you.

663
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.644
Here.

664
00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:41.728
Good luck.

665
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.440
-Tag's active.
-Copy.

666
00:49:47.734 --> 00:49:50.124
Harrington. you getting any signal?
Tag is active.

667
00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.698
Yeah. just give me a second.

668
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:04.542
Hey. anybody know
how Henderson's wheelie thing works?

669
00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:05.919
Uh. any ideas?

670
00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:08.839
There's a safety lock.
Look for a small switch under the wheel.

671
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:11.717
<i>There should be
a safety lock under the wheel.</i>

672
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.261
Safety lock. real necessary.

673
00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.313
Okay.

674
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.986
Okay. getting a signal.

675
00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:33.238
It's pretty quiet. though.

676
00:50:42.914 --> 00:50:45.500
Okay. signal's holding a steady 90 dB.

677
00:50:45.584 --> 00:50:49.171
But how am I supposed to monitor this
and drive without Henderson?

678
00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.090
Uh. hear anything from Inspector Gadget?

679
00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:53.175
Nothing.

680
00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.469
I can do it. I... I can monitor.

681
00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:56.845
No. You're staying here.

682
00:50:56.928 --> 00:50:59.598
Mom. I helped Dustin set up the antenna.
I know how to work it.

683
00:50:59.681 --> 00:51:02.184
Out of the question.
It... It's just a wheel.

684
00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:03.393
It's not just a wheel.

685
00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:05.428
Jonathan. you... you can work it. right?

686
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.983
Yeah. yeah. I mean. I think so.

687
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.277
You better not think. You better know.

688
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.409
You lose me out there.
I'm not coming home.

689
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.989
I can handle it.

690
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.388
You comfortable back there. Byers?

691
00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.299
Or you want me to get you a pillow?

692
00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:39.721
Just focus on driving.

693
00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:07.833
Try to get back to me in one piece. okay?

694
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.256
What?

695
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.424
Sorry. I'm just looking at you.

696
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.552
You get more beautiful every day.

697
00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:22.681
How is that fair?

698
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.183
You didn't answer my question.

699
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:26.476
I know.

700
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.728
You didn't answer mine.

701
00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:10.729
Look. she was standing
at the fence. talking into thin air.

702
00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:12.481
She probably was talking to herself.

703
00:53:12.564 --> 00:53:14.233
...standing
there talking to nobody.

704
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:18.278
Well. she's hardly the first child
to have an imaginary friend. Karen.

705
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.656
I wouldn't be so worried
if she was five years old.

706
00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:22.199
but she's not five anymore. is she?

707
00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:25.285
In fact. do you even know
how old your daughter is?

708
00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.663
-Oh. you don't even know how old she is!
-You're ridiculous.

709
00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:29.790
I'm not talking to you
when you're like this.

710
00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.125
First one tonight.
or already onto number two?

711
00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:33.585
Does it matter?

712
00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:56.584
Squawk to Crow's Nest. anything? Over.

713
00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:58.545
Negative. not a peep.

714
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:06.542
Do you have to chew so loud?

715
00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:08.388
Snipers chew gum.

716
00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.806
You're not a sniper.

717
00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:15.645
Package incoming.
Four trucks. outer east gate on Main.

718
00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:20.025
We got action.
Four trucks. outer east gate on Main.

719
00:55:27.073 --> 00:55:28.366
The hole! Clear the hole.

720
00:55:30.118 --> 00:55:32.120
Burners. prepare to deploy.

721
00:55:32.203 --> 00:55:35.623
On my mark! Move. move. move.

722
00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:37.512
Burners heading for the gate.

723
00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:43.757
Burn commencing in five. four.

724
00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:47.177
<i>three. two.</i>

725
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.220
and boom!

726
00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:07.030
Trucks moving in.

727
00:56:07.113 --> 00:56:08.573
Trucks moving in.

728
00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:28.426
Am I clear?

729
00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:33.348
-Clear to the east.
-East is clear.

730
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.100
And to the west?

731
00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:40.188
Hold. We got a straggler.

732
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.815
Come on.

733
00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:43.483
Get the hell out of there.

734
00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:44.567
Come on.

735
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.323
Clear.

736
00:57:01.835 --> 00:57:02.752
He's in.

737
00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:04.170
He's in.

738
00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.184
Open sesame.

739
00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:40.039
He's flipped.

740
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.133
Jonathan. signal?

741
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:58.308
Snagged it.

742
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.020
-Should I move?
-No.

743
00:58:02.604 --> 00:58:03.521
Hold.

744
00:58:04.689 --> 00:58:06.941
Hold. Hold.

745
00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:09.861
Hold.

746
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.279
Go!

747
00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:20.038
Van is on the move.

748
00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:30.715
Hopper. can you hear us okay?

749
00:58:30.798 --> 00:58:32.592
Yeah. yeah. loud and clear.

750
00:58:33.259 --> 00:58:35.595
Good. good. Okay. hard part's over.

751
00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:39.098
I mean. speak for yourself.
I still gotta jump out of this thing.

752
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:42.310
And is it me.
or are we moving faster than normal?

753
00:58:42.393 --> 00:58:43.436
A little faster.

754
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.231
Just aim for the grass.

755
00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:49.631
I was gonna go for the asphalt.
but now that you mention the grass...

756
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.743
What's going on? Hopper?

757
00:58:59.452 --> 00:59:00.871
-We're losing him!
-Wait. what?

758
00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:02.372
Wait! Stop! Stop!

759
00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:14.509
We got him.

760
00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:19.097
{\an8}Hopper. do you copy?

761
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:20.598
Hopper!

762
00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:23.059
<i>Yeah. I copy.</i>

763
00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:24.727
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

764
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:27.605
I don't know. We just slammed to a stop.

765
00:59:27.689 --> 00:59:29.732
Wh... Why would they stop?

766
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.526
The soldiers...

767
00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:34.195
they know he's there.

768
00:59:35.488 --> 00:59:36.781
We don't know that.

769
00:59:43.663 --> 00:59:45.623
What's going on over there?

770
00:59:49.961 --> 00:59:51.087
There are too many.

771
00:59:51.796 --> 00:59:53.214
He can't take them.

772
01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.693
Whoa!

773
01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.925
-The hell's happening?
-I don't know.

774
01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:27.809
Will! No!

775
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:28.851
Honey!

776
01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:32.522
Will! Will! Will!

777
01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:13.771
Squawk. do you copy?

778
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.607
Joyce? Anyone?

779
01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:39.630
Will. Will. come back!
Come on. honey.

780
01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:42.216
Will. come back. Come back.

781
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.468
Will. come on.

782
01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:45.553
Will! Will! Wake up!

783
01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.739
Come back! Come back!

784
01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.241
Will. sweetie. It's okay.

785
01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.785
Mom!

786
01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.078
It's okay. It's okay.

787
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.998
I'm here. I'm here.

788
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:16.626
It's okay. Just breathe. Just breathe.

789
01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:18.920
What happened?

790
01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:23.341
I saw it.

791
01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.760
What? What did you see?

792
01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:27.386
The Demogorgon.

793
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.682
It's coming. It's coming for them.

794
01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:34.602
For who? Who's them?

795
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.445
Robin. stay here.

796
01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.198
Contact Hopper. the boys.
Tell everyone what's going on.

797
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:48.241
Right. Right.

798
01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.535
-Think you can get the power back on?
-I can try.

799
01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:53.871
You do. you call my house
and tell everyone to get the hell out.

800
01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:54.789
Okay.

801
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.085
Mom!

802
01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:26.464
