-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

2
00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.540
Bullshit.

3
00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:23.750
It is this friggin' wide.

4
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.252
And it's periodic.

5
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.629
Bull. Shit.

6
00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:28.714
Show me.

7
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.014
Something terrestrial. gotta be.

8
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.349
Bouncing off the moon.

9
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.685
Gee. I never thought to check that.

10
00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.104
Look at that slope. man.

11
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:46.023
You could ski down that thing.

12
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.399
It is drifting.

13
00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.235
Look here. Zoom in. Zoom in.

14
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.570
See that variation?

15
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.490
And look. This gap here?
This is where it stops. then starts over.

16
00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:58.118
- It repeats?
- Every 78 seconds.

17
00:01:58.202 --> 00:01:59.494
The whole entire thing.

18
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.831
Three hours straight. and no end in sight.

19
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:08.169
It can't be.

20
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.809
It's gotta be something
bouncing off the… off the…

21
00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:24.978
It's not bouncing off the moon. Dave.

22
00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:28.065
Well. maybe it's those Chatty Cathys
at the Forest Service.

23
00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.443
I hate those guys. Always on their radios.
talking about trees.

24
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:33.529
Dave. it's not Smokey Bear
we're picking up.

25
00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:34.613
Look at that signal.

26
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.198
It's drifting.

27
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.492
What is it. then?

28
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.210
Looks like simple pulse-width modulation.
Old-school. like Morse code.

29
00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:53.173
Maybe somehow.
it's the time signal out of Fort Collins.

30
00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:56.009
- They use pulse-width modulation.
- It's not the atomic clock.

31
00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:58.512
The atomic clock changes every minute
because it's a clock.

32
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.431
This is the same exact data
repeated every 78 seconds.

33
00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:06.645
Plus. this is coming
from 600 light-years away.

34
00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.150
This Morse code of yours
seems to be split four ways.

35
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.406
The pulses are of equal duration.

36
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.242
but they're positioned
across four different frequencies.

37
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.579
- Looks like a player piano.
- So not binary but base four.

38
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.080
Quaternary.

39
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:28.333
This won't be easy to crack.

40
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.718
No. no. If you look at this. Look at…

41
00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:41.430
What do you think it says?

42
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:45.017
Maybe just.
"Hello. Hey. hey. We're out here."

43
00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.687
What did we put on Voyagers 1 and 2?
Chuck Berry?

44
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.899
Maybe this is just
their version of "Johnny B. Goode."

45
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.069
Imagine the power it took to send it.

46
00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:57.905
Megawatts?

47
00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.823
Gigawatts?

48
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.826
And that's if it's pointed only at us.

49
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.620
Antenna the size of Africa.

50
00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.704
Bigger.

51
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.167
You go to all that trouble
to send a message.

52
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.878
it's gotta be more than just "hello."

53
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.839
And why make it hard to understand?

54
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.466
Quaternary?

55
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.553
That's like encryption.
Why would you bother to…

56
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.105
It's not quaternary.

57
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.070
I think I know what it is.

58
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.949
The twin moons hung low and full.

59
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.785
Two wine-green eyes
peering over the horizon

60
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.204
as if to steal a glimpse
into Lucasia's soul.

61
00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.124
She paced the blood-soaked decks
of the Mercator.

62
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:36.003
looking for something. anything.
that might take her mind off Raban.

63
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:40.841
Ascending the forecastle. her gaze
lingered over a bare-chested young sailor.

64
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.302
On hands and knees he scrubbed.

65
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:47.723
his sinewy forearms stretched taut as he
washed away all trace of the day's fight.

66
00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:50.142
With a languid nod…

67
00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:54.479
Lucasia bade him follow to her cabin.

68
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.358
Little did this callow deckhand know
that serving at his captain's pleasure

69
00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:00.194
might take on such sweet meaning.

70
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:05.449
Or. regrettably.
that it would last but a single night.

71
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:12.789
Later. at four bells.
Lucasia stood by the mizzenmast.

72
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.959
Once again. she was alone.

73
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.795
She pulled her topcoat tighter.

74
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.924
fingering its coarse wool
as her thoughts flashed back to Raban.

75
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.260
It had been he who first wrapped
the coat around her.

76
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.137
whispering in her ear.

77
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:31.600
"May this keep you warm
in my absence. ma chérie."

78
00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:37.064
With that. Raban. proud. haughty Raban.

79
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.192
mounted the plank and leaped from sight.

80
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:43.278
The amaranthine slipsand closed over him.

81
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.906
leaving nary a ripple.

82
00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:02.214
Attention. lovers of speculative
historical romance literature.

83
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:05.926
best-selling author Carol Sturka
will now sign her new novel.

84
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.511
"Bloodsong of Wycaro."

85
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.763
the fourth book in her
"Winds of Wycaro" trilogy.

86
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:12.724
"Why-car-oh." please!
It's "Winds of Why-car-oh!"

87
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.061
And Bloodsong is the best yet.

88
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.813
God. are you in for a treat.

89
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.691
Let's go sign books!

90
00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.904
Raban is alive. right?

91
00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:27.865
Maureen. You could read it.

92
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.283
Well. I will. Tonight.

93
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.410
I've already unplugged the phone.

94
00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.078
Just…

95
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.622
- Raban's not on the cover.
- No. he's not.

96
00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:39.042
And he's never not been
on the cover. Carol.

97
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.295
If Raban doesn't come back…

98
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:43.422
I'm done.

99
00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:45.174
Come here.

100
00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:48.051
Page 218.

101
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:53.765
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Bye.

102
00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:54.933
Thanks. Maureen.

103
00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:57.686
- Okay. this is Olga.
- Hi. Hi. Olga.

104
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.441
Hi. Yvette!

105
00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:05.319
Hi!

106
00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:06.987
Love it.

107
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.158
- Happy reading.
- This is Nicky. with a pillow.

108
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.285
- Nicky with a… Oh. my gosh!
- I made it myself.

109
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.120
- Look at that. You made this?
- Yes.

110
00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:16.205
This is Christine.

111
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:18.373
This is Paulina and support person.

112
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:19.541
- This is Carlotta.
- Hi.

113
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.251
Say. "Raban".

114
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.003
Raban.

115
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.422
When Raban and Eldgammel
fell in the cargo hold.

116
00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:27.382
do you remember what it was loaded with?

117
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.675
Mandovian spicefruit.

118
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.844
Which Lucasia is…

119
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.804
Deathly allergic to!

120
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.265
- You guys run a fan club?
- Of course!

121
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.479
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you.

122
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.563
- Hi. Tanya.
- Hi!

123
00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:42.773
- Are you excited?
- Yes.

124
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.066
- Hi. Yvonne.
- Hi.

125
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.984
I got two books. one for the tub.

126
00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:49.029
This is a authentic cutlass
just like Raban's.

127
00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.781
- Okay.
- Careful. it's really sharp.

128
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.366
Okay. so three things.

129
00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:55.661
A: When finally are they
gonna make a "Wycaro" movie?

130
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.664
And please tell me it'll be in actual
theaters. not on the Lifetime Network.

131
00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.999
B: You gotta get ILM to do the slipsand.

132
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:03.544
otherwise it's just gonna look like merde.
pardon my French.

133
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:07.214
And C: A small but very crucial point.

134
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:12.052
as a two-masted schooner. the Mercator
would not possess a mizzenmast. So…

135
00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.888
Craig. I'm gonna need you
to put this back in the bag

136
00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:16.473
before the store manager sees it.

137
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.433
Right.

138
00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.852
- Your humble servant.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:22.771
That's the one.

140
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.023
Thank you so much.

141
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:27.693
- We'll see you at the next one.
- Happy reading.

142
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.570
All right. All right.

143
00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:37.244
Hi. ladies. I have us
going to the Hyatt Regency Dallas.

144
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.580
Hi. Yeah. Thanks. perfect.

145
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:43.834
That was quite a send-off.
I'm sorry. should I know who you are?

146
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.171
Depends. You a big fan of mindless crap?

147
00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.331
Morning. Doc.

148
00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:24.458
Well. it certainly is.

149
00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:27.127
- Hey. Mel.
- Hey.

150
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.254
Where'd those come from?

151
00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:30.839
Yours truly.

152
00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:33.675
Help yourself.
I think they're mostly glazed.

153
00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:36.762
but one box ought to be sprinkled.
powdered and all that.

154
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.555
What did we do to deserve this?

155
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.934
My 14-year-old's selling 'em
for marching band.

156
00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.603
Well. aren't you a good dad.

157
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.897
- What does she play?
- Trombone.

158
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.361
- Doctor D!
- Good evening. Morning. Whatever.

159
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:54.655
- Look what Mel brought.
- For us?

160
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:55.906
Yeah. please.

161
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.699
They got you two working late.

162
00:10:57.783 --> 00:11:00.118
Yeah. I gotta gas a bunch of rats.

163
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.829
So. how goes the big project?

164
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:04.540
What have you heard?

165
00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:07.125
I don't know. Things.

166
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:09.169
Well…

167
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.421
Our team's fairly certain
we've got a sequence

168
00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.006
that encodes for a lysogenic virus.

169
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.925
But after eight whole months
of animal testing…

170
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.844
Macaques. rabbits. mice…

171
00:11:16.927 --> 00:11:19.471
- Guinea pigs.
- Guinea pigs. Now rats.

172
00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:22.057
No clinical signs whatsoever.

173
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.769
Put another way…

174
00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.604
we got bubkes.

175
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.523
We got bubkes.

176
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.748
Okay. how do you wanna do this?

177
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:50.586
I can put 'em to sleep
if you wanna do the cardiac sticks.

178
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.672
I hate the cardiac sticks.

179
00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.924
Well. you're more than welcome
to gas them.

180
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.010
I hate gassing them.

181
00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.887
Might be in the wrong career.

182
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.472
All right. cardiac sticks it is.

183
00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:04.725
Let's get it over with.

184
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:10.606
Check it out.

185
00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:12.399
Damn.

186
00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.235
What do you figure happened there?

187
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:22.367
I don't know.

188
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.600
He's looking pretty dead to me.

189
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.103
You got a heartbeat?

190
00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:52.022
I can't feel jack shit in these gloves.

191
00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:02.783
Huh. what?

192
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.577
He's absolutely got a heartbeat.

193
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:07.704
A strong one. Just bam. bam. bam.

194
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.456
It's weird.
If I didn't know any better. I'd…

195
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.000
God. Oh. shit. Oh. no.

196
00:13:12.084 --> 00:13:13.710
You've got to be kidding me.

197
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.005
- Shit.
- Did he break the skin?

198
00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:19.925
Yeah. I don't…
Yeah. it's through the glove.

199
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.135
Shit. Soak it quick.

200
00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:23.220
Keep it submerged.

201
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.681
If it's bleeding.
make sure to squeeze it out good.

202
00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.642
I'm gonna call this in
as soon as I catch him. okay?

203
00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.743
Right there.

204
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.960
Let's mark 3:36 and…

205
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.173
Jenn?

206
00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.969
Talk to me. Jenn. Jenn!

207
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.929
Jenn! Jenn! Jenn!

208
00:14:06.972 --> 00:14:08.307
We are getting out right now.

209
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:12.060
I got you. Okay. come on.

210
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:13.979
I got you.

211
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.028
Hang on.

212
00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.865
Jenn. can you hear me? It's gonna be fine.

213
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:25.949
You're gonna be all right.

214
00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.288
Come on. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right. you hear me?

215
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.249
Come on. come on. come on.
Talk to me. Come on. Jenn. come on.

216
00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:36.210
Jenn! You all right?

217
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:38.462
Jenn?

218
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.047
Just say something.

219
00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:42.424
Jenn. I got you.

220
00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:43.509
I got you.

221
00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:45.219
Jenn?

222
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.348
Hey. hey. hey. Jenn. Can you hear me?

223
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:51.767
Jenn. say something.

224
00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:03.195
Damn it.

225
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.280
Kidding me?

226
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.461
Really?

227
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.012
Damn.

228
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.393
Can you believe this thing?

229
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:39.523
You've got skinny arms.
Do you think you could maybe…

230
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:43.902
Hey.

231
00:16:25.903 --> 00:16:26.904
Yes?

232
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:28.627
I'm gonna get some gum.

233
00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:11.837
Seriously?

234
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.299
I had one Tito's in Salt Lake.
That was. like. two hours ago.

235
00:20:39.156 --> 00:20:40.282
Rye Manhattan…

236
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:44.077
and a Diet Pepsi.

237
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:45.162
Thanks.

238
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.750
We could take a cab home.

239
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.753
Don't tell me you don't need a drink.
'cause you need a drink.

240
00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:55.047
- I don't need a drink.
- You need a drink.

241
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.256
I don't need a drink.

242
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.966
I call bullshit on that.

243
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.093
I need sleep. that's what I need.

244
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:02.971
Hey. cheers. to the best tour yet.

245
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.850
- You gonna leave me hanging here?
- I do not clink glasses

246
00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:08.519
with fucking Diet Pepsi.

247
00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:11.146
Best book tour? What is that?

248
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.773
Is that like best stomach cancer?

249
00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:14.900
You endure it. you do not toast it.

250
00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.946
How I hate all those paying customers
showering me with love and respect.

251
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.781
And why do I have to make so much money?

252
00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.492
How do you bear it?

253
00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:33.919
Bunch of dummies.

254
00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:38.006
Wow. It's a ship that sails on… sand?

255
00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:41.301
Purple sand? That is…That's brilliant.

256
00:21:41.385 --> 00:21:42.469
The world needed that.

257
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.222
And the world needed
yet another female character

258
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:49.518
who spends all her time mooning over
some fucking proud and haughty pirate.

259
00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:51.770
He's a corsair. not a pirate.

260
00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:55.065
"Mandovian spicefruit."

261
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:57.943
Jesus. That… I…

262
00:21:58.026 --> 00:21:59.945
It's like a bad episode of Star Trek.

263
00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:01.697
So how about
you throw everybody a changeup?

264
00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:03.949
Green sand instead of purple?

265
00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:06.994
Maybe it's time for your serious book.

266
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:11.915
Why not? You've been plugging away
at it for five years.

267
00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:14.585
- Four and a half. Barely.
- Pardon me.

268
00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:15.752
So put it out already.

269
00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:17.045
I can't just… It…

270
00:22:18.547 --> 00:22:19.756
It needs polishing.

271
00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:22.759
Obviously. I mean it does. right?

272
00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:25.053
Okay. take the next few months and polish.

273
00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:26.138
I'll work it out.

274
00:22:26.221 --> 00:22:28.432
I'll buy you some more time
before your next Wycaro.

275
00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.853
You really think
Bitter Chrysalis is that good?

276
00:22:35.147 --> 00:22:36.773
I think people will love it.

277
00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:44.823
You ever read Finnegans Wake?

278
00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:45.908
No.

279
00:22:46.617 --> 00:22:48.911
I tried to. In grad school.

280
00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:54.166
It's probably great. I don't know.

281
00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:58.712
All I know is it made me miserable
trying to get through it.

282
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:02.966
I figure…

283
00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:07.095
you make even one person happy.
maybe that's not art.

284
00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:10.557
But it's something.

285
00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:18.649
To Raban.

286
00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:21.985
Proud. haughty Raban.

287
00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.245
Did you bring your cigarettes?

288
00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:33.288
Since when do you smoke?

289
00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.165
Since now.

290
00:23:56.186 --> 00:23:59.147
Are you trying to start a forest fire?
Stop wasting my butane.

291
00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:02.734
Stop telling me how to smoke.

292
00:24:02.818 --> 00:24:03.944
I used to smoke in middle school.

293
00:24:04.027 --> 00:24:06.405
You're supposed to light the other
person's cigarette first. by the way.

294
00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:07.990
- That's etiquette.
- Yeah? On a plane.

295
00:24:08.073 --> 00:24:10.075
do you put your own oxygen mask on first?

296
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.624
Do you wanna hear what HoustonMom78
says about Bloodsong?

297
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.460
"Best Wycaro ever!" All caps.

298
00:24:20.544 --> 00:24:21.545
And…

299
00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:26.508
- 16. 17 exclamation points.
- Wow.

300
00:24:26.592 --> 00:24:27.843
- Is that a new record?
- It's gotta be.

301
00:24:27.926 --> 00:24:31.430
"Spoiler alert. Raban is back
and yummier that ever."

302
00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:33.599
Yummier than ever. I think she means.

303
00:24:34.474 --> 00:24:37.895
"You better belief
he's got my permission to come aboard.

304
00:24:37.978 --> 00:24:39.396
I'd walk his plank any time."

305
00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:40.898
I'm sensing a nautical motif.

306
00:24:40.981 --> 00:24:43.233
A little bit. Think HoustonMom's
off her meds again?

307
00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:45.861
I think HoustonMom would spread her legs
for a grilled cheese sandwich.

308
00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:52.492
Look at that.

309
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.162
What?

310
00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:56.872
What do you think they're doing?

311
00:24:57.664 --> 00:25:00.792
- What's what doing?
- The planes. Up. Look.

312
00:25:03.378 --> 00:25:05.631
I don't know. What. is that weird?

313
00:25:05.714 --> 00:25:07.132
Yeah. it's weird. Isn't it?

314
00:25:07.216 --> 00:25:09.593
All of them kinda parallel like that.

315
00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:24.316
Anybody else weigh in?

316
00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.861
It's all the usual suspects.
plus a few new ones.

317
00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:29.488
Everybody loves it.

318
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.668
You wanna answer a few questions for them?

319
00:25:43.794 --> 00:25:45.629
- What. now? No. No. no.
- Do one quick one.

320
00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:47.589
Let 'em know you're paying attention.

321
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.426
"Carol. my husband says
Raban can be my hall pass.

322
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.263
which I don't think is fair
since Raban's not a real-life person.

323
00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:55.806
although I wish he was.

324
00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:59.726
In real-life. was there an actual man
you were thinking of

325
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.520
when you came up with Raban?"

326
00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:02.896
That's hilarious.

327
00:26:05.983 --> 00:26:07.192
You wanna tell her the truth?

328
00:26:09.778 --> 00:26:10.988
What do you have to lose?

329
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:15.200
Put down George Clooney.

330
00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:17.077
- What?
- Nothing.

331
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.871
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing. Just…

332
00:26:18.954 --> 00:26:21.081
I mean. how about
a hot Brazilian soccer player?

333
00:26:21.164 --> 00:26:22.749
Someone with dreadlocks. Hip it up.

334
00:26:24.084 --> 00:26:25.085
Just…

335
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.296
put George Clooney.

336
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.131
It's safer.

337
00:26:34.344 --> 00:26:35.721
Shit.

338
00:26:57.075 --> 00:26:59.244
Buddy. you… You okay. buddy?

339
00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:06.919
Jesus.

340
00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:19.640
Helen. should we call someone?

341
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:23.435
Helen?

342
00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:25.270
Helen. stop looking at the goddamn…

343
00:27:37.908 --> 00:27:38.909
Helen?

344
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:44.289
Oh. my God. Helen!

345
00:27:45.082 --> 00:27:46.083
Helen?

346
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.168
Helen?

347
00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:52.798
Help!

348
00:27:52.881 --> 00:27:54.716
Somebody help us!

349
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.009
Help!

350
00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:58.846
Just hang in there. Hang in there.

351
00:27:59.388 --> 00:28:00.639
Just hang in there.

352
00:28:07.813 --> 00:28:09.147
Call 911…

353
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:19.366
Oh. God.

354
00:29:22.554 --> 00:29:24.139
Come on. please.

355
00:29:24.223 --> 00:29:25.307
Please. please.

356
00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:29.686
- You've reached the Albuquerque Police…
- Yes. Hi. I…

357
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.021
- …emergency number.
- Shit!

358
00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:32.564
- Please remain on the line.
- Fuck!

359
00:29:32.648 --> 00:29:34.775
- An operator will be with you shortly.
- Fuck!

360
00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:37.486
You've reached the Albuquerque Police…

361
00:30:20.904 --> 00:30:24.366
Come on. come on. come on.

362
00:30:24.449 --> 00:30:26.410
Come on. come on. come on.

363
00:30:27.995 --> 00:30:29.246
Come on. come on. come on!

364
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:35.127
Fuck you.

365
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:38.422
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

366
00:30:42.676 --> 00:30:43.677
Fuck you!

367
00:30:52.227 --> 00:30:55.898
Hey. you gotta get out.
Come on. get out. Get out! Oh. God.

368
00:30:59.776 --> 00:31:01.445
No! Fuck!

369
00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:05.532
Fucking go!

370
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:33.912
Thank God.

371
00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:37.541
Thank God.

372
00:33:57.538 --> 00:33:59.206
Hey. Hey.

373
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:02.292
Wake up.

374
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:08.257
Dr. Nguyen. I need you to wake up.

375
00:34:09.257 --> 00:34:10.801
Please wake up.

376
00:34:10.884 --> 00:34:11.885
Doctor.

377
00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.637
Dr. Nguyen. wake up.

378
00:34:14.221 --> 00:34:15.222
Wake up.

379
00:34:15.806 --> 00:34:16.849
Please wake up.

380
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.560
Dr. Nguyen. wake up!

381
00:34:23.563 --> 00:34:24.565
Okay.

382
00:34:55.053 --> 00:34:56.388
I'm so sorry! Fuck.

383
00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:02.186
Okay.

384
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:22.456
Okay. Here we go.

385
00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:26.752
Helen?

386
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:29.004
Helen? Helen?

387
00:35:32.007 --> 00:35:33.759
Helen. Helen.

388
00:35:38.013 --> 00:35:39.014
Hi.

389
00:35:40.224 --> 00:35:41.433
Baby.

390
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.608
Hi. baby.

391
00:35:56.198 --> 00:35:57.366
No. no. no.

392
00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:25.519
Goddamn it.

393
00:36:26.645 --> 00:36:27.646
Okay.

394
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.235
Come on.

395
00:36:36.697 --> 00:36:39.199
Somebody please help me.

396
00:36:39.283 --> 00:36:41.910
No. no. no. God. no. Don't…

397
00:36:41.994 --> 00:36:44.496
Please. Please.

398
00:38:17.047 --> 00:38:18.048
Hey.

399
00:38:21.176 --> 00:38:22.261
Hey.

400
00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:32.771
What is happening?

401
00:38:49.288 --> 00:38:50.998
Hey! Hey! Don't you touch her!

402
00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:53.417
You put her down. Put her down.

403
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.294
Get out! Go away!

404
00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:02.301
What the hell is wrong with you people?

405
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.345
We just wanna help. Carol.

406
00:40:14.748 --> 00:40:17.125
What the fuck?

407
00:42:29.383 --> 00:42:30.509
Christ. no.

408
00:42:48.235 --> 00:42:49.570
Come on. come on. come on.

409
00:42:49.653 --> 00:42:51.446
Come on. come on. please.

410
00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:07.838
There's a spare key.

411
00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:11.508
We can show you.

412
00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:15.095
No. No. stop. Don't come any closer.

413
00:43:15.179 --> 00:43:17.097
We don't mean to scare you. Carol.

414
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:18.557
You're in no danger.

415
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.434
We really do want to help.

416
00:43:20.934 --> 00:43:23.478
Remember? April 2016.

417
00:43:23.562 --> 00:43:25.355
The last time you got locked out.

418
00:43:26.023 --> 00:43:28.025
You put a spare key under the flower pot.

419
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:30.235
The one on the right.

420
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:32.070
Back there.

421
00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:39.870
There you go.

422
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.170
Leave me alone.

423
00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:50.797
- Please.
- Sure. Carol.

424
00:43:50.881 --> 00:43:53.258
Just give us a couple of minutes
to clear out.

425
00:44:31.213 --> 00:44:33.340
We're very sorry for your loss.

426
00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:04.908
Fuck yeah!

427
00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:07.286
God bless America.

428
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.513
Hi. Carol. Thank you for calling.

429
00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:55.143
Yep.

430
00:48:55.644 --> 00:48:57.938
This must be so bewildering for you.

431
00:48:58.021 --> 00:48:59.106
So terrible.

432
00:48:59.189 --> 00:49:01.775
All the death and destruction
you witnessed tonight.

433
00:49:02.401 --> 00:49:06.572
Especially Helen's passing.
Please know none of that was intentional.

434
00:49:06.655 --> 00:49:08.824
You have our deepest condolences.

435
00:49:09.324 --> 00:49:11.785
And to say it again. you are in no danger.

436
00:49:11.869 --> 00:49:13.620
You are perfectly safe.

437
00:49:14.663 --> 00:49:16.707
- Okay.
- Your life is your own.

438
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:18.917
Please know that.

439
00:49:19.001 --> 00:49:21.712
Your well-being
is of utmost importance to us.

440
00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:23.338
Okay.

441
00:49:24.214 --> 00:49:25.549
Completely up to you. of course.

442
00:49:25.632 --> 00:49:28.802
but you might want to stick close to home
for the next few days.

443
00:49:28.886 --> 00:49:32.764
We've a lot to clean up.
and it may be distressing for you to see.

444
00:49:32.848 --> 00:49:35.601
But we will put things right.

445
00:49:35.684 --> 00:49:39.479
To that end. if we may be of assistance
with Helen's remains…

446
00:49:39.563 --> 00:49:40.939
- Nope.
- Okay.

447
00:49:41.607 --> 00:49:43.984
If we can help you in any way
please let us know.

448
00:49:44.067 --> 00:49:48.405
We can deliver food. medicine.
whatever you need.

449
00:49:48.488 --> 00:49:50.407
Just dial zero. day or night.

450
00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.828
You will want to call from a landline
as all the cellular networks are down.

451
00:49:54.912 --> 00:49:56.872
But we are here for you.

452
00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:03.962
We feel like we're doing
all the talking here.

453
00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:07.591
Are there any questions
you might have for us. Carol?

454
00:50:07.674 --> 00:50:08.800
Anything at all.

455
00:50:14.306 --> 00:50:16.475
Yeah. Yeah. sure.

456
00:50:17.893 --> 00:50:19.520
I guess to start with.

457
00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:23.815
what the fuck is happening?

458
00:50:23.899 --> 00:50:25.275
Well. basically…

459
00:50:25.359 --> 00:50:26.777
It's an alien invasion. right?

460
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.695
I mean. obviously it's an alien invasion.

461
00:50:28.779 --> 00:50:30.155
Actually. no. It is not.

462
00:50:30.239 --> 00:50:33.033
What the fuck it isn't. You know my name.

463
00:50:33.116 --> 00:50:35.577
You know Helen's name.

464
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:39.248
You are talking to me from my TV!

465
00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:43.168
And what the fuck is with everybody's…

466
00:50:43.252 --> 00:50:44.545
Shit like this…

467
00:50:44.628 --> 00:50:48.298
And those two weird…
the weird neighbor kids next door.

468
00:50:48.382 --> 00:50:49.842
They know where some goddamn key…

469
00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:53.679
How would they know that. huh?

470
00:50:53.762 --> 00:50:57.182
- Are you reading my mind?
- No. Absolutely not.

471
00:50:57.266 --> 00:50:58.934
We couldn't do that if we wanted to.

472
00:50:59.017 --> 00:51:01.562
Who is "we?"
Why is everybody suddenly "we?"

473
00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:04.523
You know. we could continue this
after you've had a good night's sleep.

474
00:51:04.606 --> 00:51:06.692
Who is "we?"

475
00:51:06.775 --> 00:51:08.986
"We" is us. Just us.

476
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:10.070
Who the fuck is "us?"

477
00:51:10.153 --> 00:51:12.948
Us. There are no aliens.

478
00:51:13.615 --> 00:51:15.075
Not on this planet.

479
00:51:15.158 --> 00:51:20.414
We are. however. beneficiaries
of extraterrestrial technology.

480
00:51:20.497 --> 00:51:23.292
Fourteen months ago.
astronomers discovered a radio signal

481
00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:25.669
from 600 light-years away.

482
00:51:26.253 --> 00:51:27.880
There's no telling
how long it's been repeating.

483
00:51:27.963 --> 00:51:30.591
Maybe throughout all of human existence.

484
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.303
This signal. it's made up of four tones

485
00:51:34.386 --> 00:51:39.349
representing guanine. uracil.
adenine and cytosine.

486
00:51:40.058 --> 00:51:43.437
It's a recipe. it turns out.
for a nucleotide sequence.

487
00:51:44.021 --> 00:51:45.147
RNA.

488
00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:48.859
Scientists have created
this sequence in a lab.

489
00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:53.864
It is not a living thing. per se.
It is more akin to a virus.

490
00:51:53.947 --> 00:51:55.824
Though it's not that exactly either.

491
00:51:56.909 --> 00:52:01.246
It's kind of a psychic glue
capable of binding us all together.

492
00:52:03.165 --> 00:52:04.166
Okay.

493
00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:06.877
So. if you're not aliens…

494
00:52:08.837 --> 00:52:10.464
Who am I talking to right now?
Who are you?

495
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.258
This particular individual?

496
00:52:13.342 --> 00:52:14.968
This is Davis Taffler.

497
00:52:15.052 --> 00:52:19.389
Under Secretary of Agriculture
for Farm Production and Conservation.

498
00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:23.936
But you are currently
talking to every person on Earth.

499
00:52:24.019 --> 00:52:25.771
including Davis Taffler.

500
00:52:26.396 --> 00:52:27.397
We're all one.

501
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:29.274
How does that work?

502
00:52:30.025 --> 00:52:32.653
We don't know exactly. It just does.

503
00:52:34.571 --> 00:52:35.948
Can I talk to the President?

504
00:52:36.031 --> 00:52:39.034
That individual passed away this evening.
unfortunately.

505
00:52:39.117 --> 00:52:43.330
Along with quite a few senior members
of the United States government.

506
00:52:43.413 --> 00:52:48.335
Davis Taffler happened to be
nearby and intact.

507
00:52:48.418 --> 00:52:49.962
And he was wearing a suit. So…

508
00:52:50.045 --> 00:52:52.631
So. you're in charge now?

509
00:52:52.714 --> 00:52:54.466
- The Under Secretary of…
- No.

510
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.511
Nobody's in charge.
Or everybody's in charge.

511
00:52:58.095 --> 00:52:59.888
Really. there's no such thing anymore.

512
00:52:59.972 --> 00:53:02.891
But there's got to be others like me.

513
00:53:02.975 --> 00:53:05.310
Your situation is a rare one.

514
00:53:05.394 --> 00:53:08.647
There appear to be
11 other individuals like yourself.

515
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.107
In Albuquerque?

516
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:12.317
No. In the world.

517
00:53:12.818 --> 00:53:14.236
We have reached out to them.

518
00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:17.948
Like you. they are disoriented.
Understandably.

519
00:53:19.825 --> 00:53:21.368
Rest assured. Carol.

520
00:53:21.451 --> 00:53:24.162
We will figure out
what makes you different.

521
00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:26.123
Figure it out why?

522
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.041
So we can fix it.

523
00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:30.669
So you can join us.

524
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:34.131
Oh. God.

525
00:53:37.718 --> 00:53:40.304
Carol. you still there?

526
00:53:42.556 --> 00:53:43.557
You…

527
00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:46.476
You said my life was my own.

528
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.354
It is. One hundred percent.

529
00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:53.275
So. what happens when I say no?

530
00:53:54.568 --> 00:54:00.032
Carol. once you understand
how wonderful this is…

531
00:54:01.742 --> 00:54:02.743
Carol?

532
00:54:20.302 --> 00:54:24.598
Hi! You've reached 505-796-6933.

533
00:54:24.681 --> 00:54:27.309
We're on the French Riviera
drinking champagne.
