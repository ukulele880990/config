00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:12.219
You can't keep
punishing yourself. Boyd.

3
00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:13.603
She wouldn't have wanted that.

4
00:00:13.752 --> 00:00:16.125
And I wish you had
the luxury of grief.

5
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.539
but you don't.
These people need you.

6
00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:21.829
I knew all about the divorce
and how this whole trip

7
00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:22.875
was just one last hurrah

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.380
before you sat us down
to break the news.

9
00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:27.467
Thomas is dead!
You have two other kids!

10
00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.522
Why aren't we enough for you?

11
00:00:33.397 --> 00:00:36.270
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

12
00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:44.551
Seriously. man. I don't know why
you keep staring at that thing.

13
00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:47.056
Yeah. there's two pages
stuck together here.

14
00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:50.441
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

15
00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:56.364
Holy shit.

16
00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.840
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

17
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.796
She showed me this.

18
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.044
Something was
watching me that day.

19
00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.450
the same thing that told Sara...

20
00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:06.326
And you think this thing
is trying to help us?

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.224
Whatever it is. it's a part
of the fabric of this place.

22
00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:11.167
They're in the house!
They're inside!

23
00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:18.991
Follow protocol!

24
00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:20.742
Find your buddy.
get into the van!

25
00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:22.508
Ellis! We have to
get back in the house!

26
00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:24.834
We have to get inside!
I have an idea. Come on!

27
00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:29.750
Please. please. please. please!

28
00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:30.708
We have to go.

29
00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:33.373
Go where?
Where are we going?

30
00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:34.628
You go first.

31
00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:36.323
I'll follow you down.

32
00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:38.673
We need to get to town.

33
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.390
No. We have to go to the trees.

34
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.880
You're crazy.

35
00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:43.467
You have to get inside.

36
00:01:43.623 --> 00:01:45.349
- The tree? No! No!
- You'll be safe!

37
00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.701
- What?
- I promise.

38
00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:48.372
Find your brother.
You have to tell him.

39
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.053
I'll be right behind you!

40
00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:58.607
No!
No. come here!

41
00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.614
Stay with me.

43
00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:25.232
Hey. Sheriff?

44
00:02:25.327 --> 00:02:26.894
Yep.

45
00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:30.100
In a sec.

46
00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.242
I got. uh...

47
00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:40.085
I got most of the Colony House
residents squared away.

48
00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.476
Most people in town aren't
really using their basements.

49
00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:44.913
so each house is
gonna take two or three.

50
00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:46.935
Some are at the clinic and. uh.

51
00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:49.732
the last three are gonna
stay with me and my mom...

52
00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.193
and Jade. I guess.

53
00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:54.475
Okay.

54
00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:57.452
Feels like things are starting
to get tense out there.

55
00:02:57.537 --> 00:02:59.572
People are already
boarding up their windows.

56
00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.116
and with Colony House and
the town living together now.

57
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.846
I think maybe we should get
everyone gathered together

58
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.063
and. I don't know.
say something?

59
00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:09.900
It's a good idea.

60
00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:12.027
You should do that.

61
00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.230
I think it would mean
a lot more coming from you.

62
00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:18.251
Right.

63
00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:20.847
Right.

64
00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:24.039
Are you okay?

65
00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.538
He saved my life.
You know that?

66
00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:31.046
Father Khatri.
the night we got into town.

67
00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.571
he risked his own life
to make sure that...

68
00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:38.569
- Give everyone my regards.
- Wait. Where are you going?

69
00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:39.914
I got something to do.
It's important.

70
00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:41.825
More important than this?

71
00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:44.756
Sheriff. the people
need you right now.

72
00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:46.453
- They need to hear that...
- What?

73
00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:48.271
They need to hear what?

74
00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.343
Everything's gonna be okay?
That God's got a plan.

75
00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:53.211
Look. if you're gonna be
the sheriff when I'm gone.

76
00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.476
you're gonna need to start
figuring out how to say things

77
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.160
like that for yourself
and sound halfway convincing.

78
00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.661
You'll do fine.

79
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.482

00:06:43.873 --> 00:06:45.465

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:47.721
- Listen to those lyrics.

108
00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:50.028
Listen to how
peaceful that sounds.

109
00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:53.988
The man is riding
a pony on an ocean.

110
00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:57.951
You know why?
'Cause he has a boat.

111
00:06:58.076 --> 00:07:00.212
Doesn't matter how many times
you listen to the song.

112
00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:01.943
still can't afford
to buy a boat.

113
00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.951
Yeah. look. all I'm saying is
if we manage the payments...

114
00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:06.936
Oh. we're gonna
manage the payments?

115
00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:08.748
- Yeah!
- Right.

116
00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.983
So. is not paying the payments
one of the management options?

117
00:07:12.068 --> 00:07:14.139
Because that's
the option we'd be taking.

118
00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:16.406
Yeah. I'm pretty sure most
lenders frown on that option.

119
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.230
Yeah. yeah. Listen.
nobody's talking to you.

120
00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:21.101
All right? Nobody.

121
00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.238
You know what they used
to call e in the army. right?

122
00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:24.714
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

123
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:26.542
That's right!
That's right! That's right!

124
00:07:26.673 --> 00:07:28.199
They'd send me to
any base to set it up.

125
00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:30.808
and no matter what they gave me.
no matter what the resources.

126
00:07:30.938 --> 00:07:32.682
I would make it work.
Yes. sir. that's right.

127
00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:34.033
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

128
00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:35.336
...Loaves.

129
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.727
Yeah. but. you know. didn't
they call mom Iron Abby?

130
00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:40.311
They certainly did.
And don't you forget it.

131
00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:42.471
Yeah. yeah.
I hear you.

132
00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:45.592
The problem with iron is...
rigid.

133
00:07:46.014 --> 00:07:49.398
So. sometimes. you know.
it doesn't know when to bend.

134
00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:50.397
Uh-huh.

135
00:07:50.482 --> 00:07:53.726
Babe... Babe...
all I'm saying.

136
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:55.769
all I'm saying is. a boat.

137
00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:59.873
you know. wouldn't be
a bad retirement gift.

138
00:08:00.287 --> 00:08:01.647
In case you
needed some ideas

139
00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:04.725
on how to help me. you know.
smooth my transition

140
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.943
from a long and decorated
military career to. you know.

141
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:12.396
this strange and mysterious
civilian life.

142
00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:14.552
And a boat... Babe. what are...
What are you looking for?

143
00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:17.037
My-my Chapstick. I can't
find anything in this bag.

144
00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:19.071
Can you hold this for me?

145
00:08:19.156 --> 00:08:21.462
Sure.
What is... Is...

146
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.632
This...
This looks like a boat key.

147
00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:26.576
- What?
- What?

148
00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:29.318
Yeah. why am I holding
a-a boat key?

149
00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:31.494
Wait. did you buy the boat?

150
00:08:31.624 --> 00:08:33.278
Oh. shit.

151
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.628
Of course we
bought you a boat!

152
00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:37.674
- Oh. snap!
- If I had to listen to that man

153
00:08:37.804 --> 00:08:39.676
sing about Tonto and
his pony one more time.

154
00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.547
I'd throw myself into traffic.

155
00:08:41.678 --> 00:08:43.201
- Oh. snap!
- Happy retirement. Dad!

156
00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:45.116
You bought me a boat. baby!

157
00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:46.422
- Thank you!
- Dad!

158
00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:48.424
Oh!

159
00:08:57.607 --> 00:08:58.695
Oh. God.

160
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.312
Please.

161
00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:09.706
can you just tell me
where we're going?

162
00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:11.490
Where's Father Khatri?

163
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.408
They used to shriek.
Did you know that?

164
00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:20.847
All night long. they'd shriek.
Drove people crazy.

165
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.242
That all stopped
once we got the talismans.

166
00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:25.548
Then they started to whisper.

167
00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:27.854
I always wondered about that.

168
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:30.379
Your voices tell you
anything about that?

169
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:33.164
No.

170
00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:36.080
'Course not. God forbid
they tell you anything useful.

171
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:39.300
Keep walking.

172
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:42.086
Not until you
tell me what's going on.

173
00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.653
You think you're
gonna stand there

174
00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:45.263
and make demands
after what you did?

175
00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:46.525
Where is Father Khatri?

176
00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:48.563
He's dead!

177
00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:50.094
What?

178
00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:51.704
Those things got
into Colony House.

179
00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:55.273
Father Khatri tried to help.
Now he's dead.

180
00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:57.754
along with a lot
of other people.

181
00:09:57.884 --> 00:09:59.886
Is Ellis okay?

182
00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:05.675
He's fine.
He's scraped up.

183
00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:08.591
He's back at the clinic
with the others.

184
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.681
Oh. now you wanna cry.

185
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.597
You cry like that
for Bing Qian?

186
00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:16.816
You think I'm a monster.

187
00:10:16.947 --> 00:10:18.949
I don't give
two shits what you are.

188
00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:21.647
The only reason you're alive
is because Father Khatri

189
00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:23.301
thought you could
help us all get home.

190
00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:24.868
The second you prove him wrong.

191
00:10:24.998 --> 00:10:27.827
I'm gonna put
a bullet in you myself.

192
00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.916
Now. keep walking.

193
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.551
- Where are we going?
- I said keep walking!

194
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:46.061
So. I'll make up some beds
for you in the basement.

195
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.761
Uh. bathroom's in the back and
feel free to use the kitchen.

196
00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:50.807
but you've gotta
respect the rations.

197
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:52.812
It won't be the most
comfortable thing in the world.

198
00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.379
but we should have Colony House
back up

199
00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:55.812
and running pretty soon. so...

200
00:10:55.942 --> 00:10:58.031
What the fuck is this?

201
00:10:58.162 --> 00:11:00.730
Uh. we're gonna have a few more
house guests for a little while.

202
00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:04.538
And how little
is a little while?

203
00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:07.392
Aren't you the guy that thought
this was a giant escape room?

204
00:11:07.476 --> 00:11:09.260
How'd that work out for you?

205
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.653
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

206
00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:12.481
All right.
this is bullshit. okay?

207
00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:14.224
They chose the flower.
They don't belong here.

208
00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:15.440
Dude. why don't
you just...

209
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.705
All right.
any of you guys know Victor?

210
00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:19.749
All right. where's he squatting?
I need to find him.

211
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.707
I saw him running
towards the woods

212
00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:23.404
with the Matthews
girl last night.

213
00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:25.755
Fantastic.
See what a little inter community

214
00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.540
cooperation can do?
Kumbay-fucking-ya!

215
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.717
Let's get inside.

216
00:11:31.848 --> 00:11:33.937
That guy's
the fuckin' worst.

217
00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:37.070
I don't...
I don't even understand.

218
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:39.725
It was like one second everyone
was having such a good time...

219
00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:41.771
How... How did you
get out of the house?

220
00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:45.339
I was... I was up in
Victor's room and we...

221
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.559
No. It...

222
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.782
- It wasn't like that. We were...
- Julie...

223
00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.824
No. he was stacking
all of these.

224
00:11:51.955 --> 00:11:53.829
and it looked like he was
getting ready to leave.

225
00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.915
And then.
when the screaming started.

226
00:11:56.046 --> 00:11:58.483
we climbed out his window.

227
00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:00.354
and he said we had
to go to the forest.

228
00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:03.053
And then. we ran to this tree
and then he pushed me inside...

229
00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:04.881
- Hey.
- And I...

230
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:06.709
He said it was starting.

231
00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:08.652
What was starting?

232
00:12:08.737 --> 00:12:10.827
I don't know. He...

233
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:15.892
All I know is. one second.
I was in a tree.

234
00:12:16.022 --> 00:12:18.764
and the next. I was in a
giant cabinet in a root cellar.

235
00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:19.939
How is that possible?

236
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.681
You went through a Farway Tree!

237
00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:24.814
Huh?

238
00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:28.034
Victor said you can
go all sorts of places.

239
00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:31.821
And sometimes people
go to different places.

240
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.910
So. maybe he went
somewhere else.

241
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.868
We have to find him!

242
00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:38.741
One step at a time.
Hey. Julie...

243
00:12:41.047 --> 00:12:42.701
Jules...
Hey. Jules.

244
00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:46.270
Julie...

245
00:12:47.924 --> 00:12:50.796
What's happening to us?
What...?

246
00:12:50.927 --> 00:12:52.755
- Honey...
- What is going on?

247
00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:53.885
What's happening?

248
00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:55.932
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

249
00:12:56.062 --> 00:12:58.412
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

250
00:12:58.543 --> 00:13:00.676
Hey. hey. No.

251
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.679
Jules. we're gonna be fine.
Breathe.

252
00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:06.464
I know.
Everything's gonna be okay.

253
00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:08.205
- Yes.
- No! How can you say that?

254
00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:10.468
What part of this is okay?

255
00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.862
Honey. oh my God.
Just...

256
00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:15.865
Ah. Good. you're here.
Have you seen Victor?

257
00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.606
- Hey!
- One of the squatters

258
00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:19.785
at my house said you ran off to
the woods with him last night!

259
00:13:19.869 --> 00:13:20.783
Ow! Ow!

260
00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:21.958
Hey!
I need to talk to her!

261
00:13:22.043 --> 00:13:24.376
What is wrong with you?!

262
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:26.963
Do you have any idea
what she has been through?

263
00:13:27.093 --> 00:13:28.968
Look. believe me. I get it.
Times are tough all around.

264
00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:31.315
But I found
something last night!

265
00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:35.798
There is this symbol that
I've been... I've been seeing.

266
00:13:35.928 --> 00:13:37.495
The same symbol is in this book.

267
00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:38.975
And last night. okay.
last night.

268
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:40.629
I found this photo!

269
00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:42.111
I don't give a shit
about your questions

270
00:13:42.195 --> 00:13:44.067
and your symbol and your books.

271
00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:46.460
Just stay the fuck away
from my daughter.

272
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:48.724
You understand me?

273
00:13:50.813 --> 00:13:54.991
Okay. you're doing the whole
protective dad thing.

274
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.862
I respect that.

275
00:13:56.993 --> 00:13:59.952
You dragged me out
into the woods.

276
00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:02.955
have me climb a fuckin' tree
for some stupid idea.

277
00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:04.957
and then you
run off like a psycho

278
00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:06.540
before we even have
a chance to try it.

279
00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:10.018
Yeah. uh.
I'm sorry about that...

280
00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:11.834
It worked.

281
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.055
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

282
00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:19.798
All I got was some static.
but it worked.

283
00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.847
I think if we get it
up over the tree line.

284
00:14:24.977 --> 00:14:26.109
and we get it enough power.

285
00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:27.893
I think we could
get a signal out.

286
00:14:28.024 --> 00:14:29.155
Wait. wait. wait.

287
00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:31.680
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

288
00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.727
We start by going
to the high ground.

289
00:14:48.174 --> 00:14:50.394
Jesus. That's grim.

290
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:58.881
Where are
all the people?

291
00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:00.491
I mean...

292
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:03.015
Wait!

293
00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:05.061
- Whoa. Boyd!
- Jesus!

294
00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:07.846
Hey!
Hey. hey. back up!

295
00:15:08.978 --> 00:15:10.153
Back up!

296
00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:12.677
You tryin' to get
yourself killed?

297
00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:14.331
I need you to
listen to me. please.

298
00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.463
Okay?
There isn't much time.

299
00:15:16.594 --> 00:15:20.163
Now. this is gonna
sound very. very strange.

300
00:15:20.293 --> 00:15:21.947
and you're not
gonna believe me.

301
00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:23.993
and I wouldn't
believe me either. Okay?

302
00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.763
And I wish there was
more time to explain.

303
00:15:25.864 --> 00:15:27.390
But if you don't come
with me right now.

304
00:15:27.474 --> 00:15:29.955
you're all going to die.

305
00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:32.436
- Oh...
- Okay. whoa. whoa. whoa. Mom.

306
00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:34.481
Mom. what the hell
are you doing?

307
00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:36.570
Okay. you have a gun.
That is good.

308
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:39.748
And you're welcome to keep it
pointed at me the entire time.

309
00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:43.664
But I am begging you.
please come with me.

310
00:15:43.795 --> 00:15:46.624
Go on.
Drive away. Drive away.

311
00:15:46.755 --> 00:15:48.234
No. no. no. no. Please.

312
00:15:51.194 --> 00:15:54.110
What the hell was that?

313
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.155
That was death.

314
00:15:56.286 --> 00:15:58.767
and it's coming...
right now.

315
00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:03.075
Please.

316
00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:15.479
Let's go.

317
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:29.841
You can put that thing away now.

318
00:16:29.972 --> 00:16:31.890
The only things that are
gonna hurt you are out there.

319
00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:34.153
and that thing's not gonna
make a damn bit of difference

320
00:16:34.237 --> 00:16:35.499
if they find us.

321
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:41.461
Look. I know you
all have questions.

322
00:16:42.288 --> 00:16:46.292
And. I promise. we will talk
when the sun comes up.

323
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:04.528
- Okay.
- Ah...

324
00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:05.750
- Here we go. all right?
- Okay.

325
00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:07.052
- Nice and slow.
- Okay.

326
00:17:07.183 --> 00:17:08.274
It's gonna hurt a bit.
Just breathe.

327
00:17:08.358 --> 00:17:10.447
- Yeah.
- Good. good. good.

328
00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:11.187
There we go.

329
00:17:11.317 --> 00:17:12.536
Breathe.

330
00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.146
Good.
Breathe. breathe. breathe.

331
00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.124
Relax. Down. Good.

332
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:17.601
Okay. see?
Good as new.

333
00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:18.402
Yeah.

334
00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.109
- All right.
- Yeah.

335
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.766
Just gonna put a sling on here.

336
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:22.981
Can I help with anything?

337
00:17:23.112 --> 00:17:25.679
Make sure
he doesn't get out of bed. Okay?

338
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.116
I don't want you going anywhere

339
00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.814
until I can give you
a solid once-over.

340
00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.210
- Yeah.
- All right?

341
00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:34.036
Here we go. You good?

342
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.039
Be back in
a second. okay?

343
00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:39.041
Thank you.

344
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:41.434
Hey.

345
00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:43.262
Busy day for you.

346
00:17:43.393 --> 00:17:45.047
Uh. yeah. we're
a little short-handed.

347
00:17:45.177 --> 00:17:46.657
What can I do?

348
00:17:46.787 --> 00:17:48.093
Well. I could use some help

349
00:17:48.224 --> 00:17:49.664
getting this place
a bit more secure.

350
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.796
It's gonna be a full house
tonight. given what happened.

351
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.446
- So...
- Yeah. of course.

352
00:17:53.577 --> 00:17:55.796
Oh. I. um...

353
00:17:55.927 --> 00:17:59.191
I. uh...
I finished Chapter 6. It's...

354
00:17:59.322 --> 00:18:01.150
Things are starting
to get interesting.

355
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.151
Yeah. I don't think
it's gonna be

356
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:04.109
much of a reading
night tonight. but. uh.

357
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.719
yeah. I'll try to check it out.

358
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.025
Cool.

359
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.378
Thanks. Deputy.

360
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:27.393
Donna.

361
00:18:37.403 --> 00:18:40.232
You got a minute?

362
00:18:40.363 --> 00:18:42.495
How's Julie?

363
00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:45.063
She's okay.

364
00:18:45.194 --> 00:18:46.630
She's. uh...

365
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.154
But that...
That's not why I'm here.

366
00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:51.243
We came because
we need your help.

367
00:18:51.374 --> 00:18:52.288
With what?

368
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.422
We wanna build a tower

369
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.076
and we wanna
put it on the roof.

370
00:18:58.207 --> 00:18:59.207
What?

371
00:18:59.295 --> 00:19:00.647
We think if we can
get it high enough.

372
00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:03.908
we could
broadcast a signal

373
00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:06.171
that anyone else
in the area could hear.

374
00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:08.826
And what area
is that exactly?

375
00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:12.351
Look. whatever
this place is.

376
00:19:12.482 --> 00:19:16.268
wherever this place is.

377
00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:19.315
radio signals work
in ways that we can't.

378
00:19:19.445 --> 00:19:22.144
And we already got a strong
indication that this could work.

379
00:19:24.102 --> 00:19:26.322
Well...
We got a little static.

380
00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:29.281
C... Colony House

381
00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:32.284
is the highest point
on the highest hill.

382
00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:34.504
And if we build a tower
and we put it up there.

383
00:19:34.634 --> 00:19:36.941
we could broadcast out a signal
that could get up over

384
00:19:37.072 --> 00:19:40.684
any interference
from the forest canopy.

385
00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:45.471
Sure.

386
00:19:47.952 --> 00:19:49.998
You're okay with this?

387
00:19:50.128 --> 00:19:53.131
You know how many people
died here last night?

388
00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:56.004
Fourteen.

389
00:19:57.522 --> 00:19:59.843
Those things killed
14 of my people.

390
00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:03.932
There are pieces of them
lying all over this hill.

391
00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:08.146
And I don't think the others
are coming back any time soon.

392
00:20:11.454 --> 00:20:13.760
So. we might as well use
the house for something.

393
00:20:17.193 --> 00:20:18.847
Keep going.

394
00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:23.761
Wait right there.

395
00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:34.738
Let's go.

396
00:20:43.355 --> 00:20:44.922
You're gonna sit tight here.

397
00:20:45.053 --> 00:20:47.620
I'll be back before dark.

398
00:20:47.751 --> 00:20:52.234
I've got a few things in town
to wrap up before we head out.

399
00:20:52.364 --> 00:20:53.583
Head out where?

400
00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:56.281
Find our way home.

401
00:20:56.412 --> 00:20:59.284
You won't need those.

402
00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:02.418
I'm not going anywhere.

403
00:21:02.548 --> 00:21:05.160
I wanna help.

404
00:21:06.147 --> 00:21:09.150
All I've ever
wanted to do is help.

405
00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:11.383
There's nothing to
chain you to here anyway.

406
00:21:11.514 --> 00:21:13.255
If you run...

407
00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:15.083
I understand.

408
00:21:19.522 --> 00:21:20.784
I'll be back.

409
00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:02.869
My God.

410
00:22:06.046 --> 00:22:08.484
Boyd.

411
00:22:08.614 --> 00:22:10.834
Here. Come on.

412
00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:30.332
Welcome to your
worst nightmare.

413
00:22:30.462 --> 00:22:31.985
Look.

414
00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:36.729
it's a...
It's a lot to unpack.

415
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.342
Just take it slow.

416
00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:42.365
I'll explain more
at the diner.

417
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:45.024
At the what?

418
00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:47.684
The diner.
It's. uh...

419
00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:49.923
Meet me over there.

420
00:22:54.138 --> 00:22:56.923
Hey.
You okay?

421
00:22:59.172 --> 00:23:01.958
No. not really.

422
00:23:02.268 --> 00:23:04.531
That's what you people
do every night here?

423
00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:08.544
Here?
You hide and pray?

424
00:23:08.674 --> 00:23:12.722
Well. there's really
not much else we can do.

425
00:23:12.852 --> 00:23:16.099
And you don't know
anything else about this place?

426
00:23:16.184 --> 00:23:18.142
Who built it?
How long's it been here?

427
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:23.211
Look. what we know
is what you see.

428
00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:26.112
And the people here.

429
00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:31.104
they just... they're just tryin'
to live through the night.

430
00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:34.222
Doesn't give us much time
for anything else.

431
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.487
You gotta start
working together.

432
00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.837
That's a little
easier said than done.

433
00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:42.099
Yeah. Right.

434
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.058
So. you start small. right?

435
00:23:45.189 --> 00:23:47.060
Gather your resources.

436
00:23:47.191 --> 00:23:50.412
create a system. making sure
everybody's covered at night.

437
00:23:50.542 --> 00:23:52.501
Nobody hides
in the same place twice.

438
00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.633
You gotta get
these people to start

439
00:23:54.764 --> 00:23:56.884
looking out for each other.
taking care of each other.

440
00:23:56.983 --> 00:24:00.291
and then. you build from there.

441
00:24:03.512 --> 00:24:04.512
Okay.

442
00:24:05.992 --> 00:24:09.257
But where do we start?

443
00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:13.173
All right.

444
00:24:13.304 --> 00:24:15.380
Once we have
everything inventoried.

445
00:24:15.465 --> 00:24:17.815
we're gonna start
rationing it out.

446
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.618
Donna here is
in charge of resupply.

447
00:24:20.703 --> 00:24:22.922
So. you need anything.
you go see her.

448
00:24:23.053 --> 00:24:25.185
Abby is gonna be
drawing up a system

449
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.663
for where we spend
the nights.

450
00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:28.580
We're gonna start
digging up some new spots.

451
00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:30.756
make sure we are
constantly rotating.

452
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:32.932
Let's not make it easy
for these things.

453
00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:35.544
Come on.
What do you got?

454
00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.415
All right.

455
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:52.778
Hey.

456
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.434
What are you doing?

457
00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:01.396
Are you hungry?

458
00:25:03.004 --> 00:25:05.224
No. Not really.

459
00:25:13.277 --> 00:25:15.453
Have you eaten anything?

460
00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:20.806
I don't know. No.

461
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.290
I'm gonna make you some food.

462
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:28.510
Are you and Dad still
getting a divorce?

463
00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:32.368
I. uh...

464
00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:35.706
I really don't have an answer
for you right now.

465
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:37.706
It's a simple question.

466
00:25:40.735 --> 00:25:42.694
It's not
that simple. honey.

467
00:25:48.712 --> 00:25:50.757
Hey. Hey.

468
00:25:52.882 --> 00:25:55.058
You said you loved each other.

469
00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.541
We do.

470
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.458
Then why?

471
00:26:03.588 --> 00:26:04.937
- Is it me?
- No.

472
00:26:05.068 --> 00:26:06.548
Did I do something wrong?

473
00:26:06.678 --> 00:26:08.724
Oh. God. no.
No. no. no. No.

474
00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:11.596
No. honey. you didn't
do anything wrong. Don't...

475
00:26:11.727 --> 00:26:13.163
No.

476
00:26:17.689 --> 00:26:19.082
Listen.

477
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.609
There are things that
you'll only understand

478
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.220
when you become a parent.

479
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:30.833
One of those things...

480
00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:33.096
is that you live
for your children.

481
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:41.496
Your only job is... is
to love them and protect them.

482
00:26:46.892 --> 00:26:49.504
So when Thomas died...

483
00:26:51.767 --> 00:26:53.595
something inside of me broke.

484
00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:00.906
And I have
no idea how to fix it.

485
00:27:07.783 --> 00:27:09.915
I keep reliving that day.

486
00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:14.157
It was just
such a normal day.

487
00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:18.995
You and Ethan were
in the next room.

488
00:27:19.563 --> 00:27:20.999
Your Dad and I
were in the kitchen.

489
00:27:21.084 --> 00:27:24.218
and Thomas was in his changing
table right between us.

490
00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:38.269
Then the phone rang.

491
00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:42.143
I reached for the diaper

492
00:27:42.273 --> 00:27:44.319
and your father reached
for the phone and...

493
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:51.500
we just turned for one second...

494
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.024
just one fucking second...

495
00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:57.158
and he rolled off the table.

496
00:28:05.514 --> 00:28:08.647
Your father
is the love of my life.

497
00:28:12.695 --> 00:28:14.914
But sometimes I see him and...

498
00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:21.530
I hear
that fucking phone ring.

499
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.316
Why didn't you tell me that?

500
00:28:28.972 --> 00:28:32.454
Because no matter
how grown up you are.

501
00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:35.196
you're always
gonna be my little girl.

502
00:28:39.156 --> 00:28:41.245
So we pretended...

503
00:28:44.553 --> 00:28:46.337
yeah. that everything was fine.

504
00:28:48.992 --> 00:28:51.212
I think that just made
everything worse.

505
00:28:55.477 --> 00:28:57.218
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:01.526
I'm sorry. too.

507
00:29:09.839 --> 00:29:11.449
Let us in!

508
00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:18.543
There's gonna be trouble if you
don't move outta the way!

509
00:29:18.674 --> 00:29:20.157
- Let us in!
- Hey. hey. hey. hey!

510
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:21.590
What the hell's going on?!

511
00:29:23.287 --> 00:29:24.465
Tom. Eli.
what the hell are you doing?

512
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:26.638
We got people from Colony House
in our houses.

513
00:29:26.769 --> 00:29:28.379
using our supplies!

514
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.859
If I gotta choose between me

515
00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:31.864
and some asshole from
Colony House raiding this place.

516
00:29:31.948 --> 00:29:34.516
- then it's gonna be me!
- Nobody's raiding anything!

517
00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:36.173
Well. those things weren't
supposed to be able

518
00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:38.911
to get into Colony House either.
and look how that turned out!

519
00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:40.612
- Exactly.
- Alright. So then. you guys...

520
00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:42.524
You just wanna
throw it all away?

521
00:29:42.654 --> 00:29:44.534
Start acting like animals
and make it all worse?

522
00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:46.615
Look. we're gonna
figure this out.

523
00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:50.096
Just... just go home.

524
00:29:50.227 --> 00:29:52.969
Just go home. please.

525
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.415
They... scared.

526
00:30:04.546 --> 00:30:05.982
Yeah.

527
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.909
Those things come out at night.

528
00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:24.043
They walking around in
the forest during the daytime?

529
00:30:24.174 --> 00:30:27.090
Not as far as we can tell.

530
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.875
There might be
resources out there.

531
00:30:30.006 --> 00:30:32.225
We go scavenging
during the daytime.

532
00:30:32.356 --> 00:30:35.098
never know what
we might find.

533
00:30:35.228 --> 00:30:38.057
Yeah.
Good luck findin' volunteers.

534
00:30:38.188 --> 00:30:42.192
Right.
We'll work on that part.

535
00:30:42.323 --> 00:30:43.976
How long were you
in the military?

536
00:30:44.415 --> 00:30:47.037
Uh. almost 30 years.

537
00:30:47.253 --> 00:30:48.662
Hm.

538
00:30:48.841 --> 00:30:50.599
Set up operations
in some of the biggest.

539
00:30:50.684 --> 00:30:53.556
baddest cluster fucks
on the planet.

540
00:30:54.158 --> 00:30:56.682
And your wife?

541
00:30:56.946 --> 00:30:59.078
Abby was a Marine.

542
00:30:59.209 --> 00:31:01.787
She's the bad ass
in the family.

543
00:31:01.872 --> 00:31:03.048
Yeah.

544
00:31:15.488 --> 00:31:18.535
Mom. you okay?

545
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.365
Yeah.

546
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.583
Yeah. I'm fine. I...

547
00:31:23.974 --> 00:31:26.294
I was just thinking
about this dream I had

548
00:31:26.379 --> 00:31:28.076
when I was a little girl.

549
00:31:28.543 --> 00:31:30.371
I was...

550
00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:35.537
Never mind.
We should go help your dad.

551
00:31:35.622 --> 00:31:37.363
Lots to do.

552
00:31:43.806 --> 00:31:45.678
Can't go. not now.

553
00:31:45.763 --> 00:31:47.974
Damn near had
a riot at the diner.

554
00:31:48.255 --> 00:31:50.529
But this is exactly
why you said you had to go.

555
00:31:50.646 --> 00:31:52.381
Things are coming apart.
It's already starting to happen.

556
00:31:52.465 --> 00:31:54.240
We lost over a dozen people
last night.

557
00:31:54.325 --> 00:31:57.802
And we'll lose more if...
if they start to panic.

558
00:31:57.887 --> 00:31:59.541
- At least if you...
- Kenny. enough.

559
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.410
I'll stay until
things settle down.

560
00:32:01.495 --> 00:32:03.584
And what if they don't?

561
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.451
What if they don't?

562
00:32:05.637 --> 00:32:06.981
Am I interrupting?

563
00:32:07.317 --> 00:32:08.449
No. come on in.

564
00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:09.626
Sheriff. please...

565
00:32:09.714 --> 00:32:13.065
Kenny. we're done. Okay?

566
00:32:13.196 --> 00:32:15.130
We're not done.

567
00:32:16.986 --> 00:32:19.163
I said. we're not done.

568
00:32:20.918 --> 00:32:22.746
You told me you had to go.

569
00:32:23.392 --> 00:32:25.645
You told me
that I had to step up

570
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.560
and be strong
while you were gone.

571
00:32:27.733 --> 00:32:29.430
You told me we were
running out of time.

572
00:32:29.515 --> 00:32:31.953
and what part
of that's changed? Huh?

573
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:34.553
We've all been sitting
around the last few months.

574
00:32:34.637 --> 00:32:36.357
acting like those
talismans were a solution.

575
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:39.005
Like they made us safe?

576
00:32:39.227 --> 00:32:42.491
Well. guess what.
We were never safe.

577
00:32:42.777 --> 00:32:45.084
Those talismans were a Band-Aid.

578
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:47.606
a... a temporary reprieve.

579
00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:51.148
Things were never okay here.

580
00:32:51.332 --> 00:32:55.005
and things are never
going to be okay here.

581
00:32:57.495 --> 00:33:02.587
We need to find a way home

582
00:33:03.413 --> 00:33:05.521
or else every
single person here

583
00:33:05.606 --> 00:33:07.434
is gonna end up
exactly like Father Khatri.

584
00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:12.709
There are answers out there.

585
00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:15.728
and you're going to find them.

586
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:17.891
And in the meantime.

587
00:33:18.241 --> 00:33:20.765
you need to get over
what happened last night.

588
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.410
You need to get
your shit together

589
00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:24.427
and be the scary hard-ass
that you've always been

590
00:33:24.512 --> 00:33:27.428
because that's who people
need you to be right now.

591
00:33:27.849 --> 00:33:30.201
And if we're not gonna fight
like hell to go home.

592
00:33:30.768 --> 00:33:33.248
then we might as well swallow
a fucking bullet right now.

593
00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:37.841
Is that what you want?

594
00:33:51.208 --> 00:33:53.862
I didn't know the little
bastard had that in him.

595
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.263
Now. how about you explain

596
00:33:57.348 --> 00:33:59.480
what the fuck
he was talking about?

597
00:33:59.565 --> 00:34:01.436
Where exactly are you going?

598
00:34:02.017 --> 00:34:05.368
Let's take a walk.
I'll explain on the way.

599
00:34:06.704 --> 00:34:08.792
Come on. man!
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

600
00:34:09.426 --> 00:34:12.021
Come on!
Help me out a little bit here.

601
00:34:12.445 --> 00:34:13.534
Hey!

602
00:34:14.253 --> 00:34:15.820
Look what I found!

603
00:34:15.905 --> 00:34:18.255
Okay. what? Where...
Where did you...?

604
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.213
I... He was about half
a mile out. eating some grass.

605
00:34:21.298 --> 00:34:23.076
There are chickens
out there too.

606
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:24.740
Tomorrow.
I'm gonna set up some traps.

607
00:34:24.825 --> 00:34:26.100
There's chickens in the forest?

608
00:34:26.185 --> 00:34:27.230
Yep.

609
00:34:27.338 --> 00:34:28.779
Hey. you know what?
Grab some people.

610
00:34:28.864 --> 00:34:31.380
We need to start rebuilding
that. uh. pen outside the barn.

611
00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:33.271
Okay? Hey! Hey!

612
00:34:33.466 --> 00:34:33.896
Hey.

613
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:35.504
- I found a goat.
- He got a goat.

614
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:36.938
Yeah. that's great.

615
00:34:37.192 --> 00:34:39.411
Hey. uh. look.
I need to talk to you.

616
00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:41.591
All right. Hey. could you
take him off my hands?

617
00:34:41.676 --> 00:34:42.138
No.

618
00:34:42.223 --> 00:34:43.654
Yeah. no. you got it.
Yeah. yeah.

619
00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.222
He's not exactly what
I'd call cooperative.

620
00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:45.998
but just hold the rope.

621
00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:46.954
- Yeah.
- You got it.

622
00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:49.044
- I. uh...
- You believe that?

623
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:51.578
I knew I was gonna find
something out in those woods.

624
00:34:51.663 --> 00:34:53.780
I ain't think it was gonna be
livestock. but I'll take it.

625
00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:54.869
Who knows what else might be...

626
00:34:54.953 --> 00:34:56.389
You need to stop
going out there.

627
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.022
What?

628
00:34:58.107 --> 00:35:00.414
It's Mom.
She's not doing well. Okay?

629
00:35:00.535 --> 00:35:02.419
I mean. you've been going out
there for weeks now.

630
00:35:02.503 --> 00:35:03.780
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

631
00:35:03.864 --> 00:35:06.171
I think this place is. like.
starting to get to her.

632
00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.623
Okay.

633
00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:12.169
Look. I know you're scared. man.

634
00:35:12.254 --> 00:35:16.954
I'm fricking terrified.
But do me a favor. Look around.

635
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.513
The things we are doing
are working.

636
00:35:20.602 --> 00:35:23.039
There are things out
in those woods that can help us.

637
00:35:23.124 --> 00:35:26.780
things that might even...
All I know. all I know is that

638
00:35:27.073 --> 00:35:30.349
the second we stop looking for
answers. that's when we lose.

639
00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:32.135
Okay. so. then why don't
we just get someone else

640
00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:34.685
to go and look for a while?
Dad. we need you here.

641
00:35:35.023 --> 00:35:36.981
Mom needs you here!

642
00:35:37.974 --> 00:35:40.513
Okay. look. she... she's not...

643
00:35:41.012 --> 00:35:44.084
You know. sometimes.
I-I see her just standing.

644
00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:46.061
staring off in the middle
of the road. like she's...

645
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:49.505
Your mom... Your mom is
as tough as they come.

646
00:35:49.642 --> 00:35:51.774
Iron Abby. remember?

647
00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:55.677
Now. I know this is hard.
but this is what we have to do.

648
00:35:56.115 --> 00:35:56.935
at least for now.

649
00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.980
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying to you!

650
00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:02.807
Look. look. okay. okay.
Look. look. Look. look.

651
00:36:02.892 --> 00:36:05.764
We got about four hours
of daylight left. right?

652
00:36:05.849 --> 00:36:08.634
Help your mom get everybody
secured. tucked away.

653
00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:11.623
And when I get home
tonight. we will talk.

654
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:13.362
I promise.

655
00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.412
Dad. please...

656
00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:19.006
just stay.

657
00:36:19.268 --> 00:36:22.097
We will talk tonight.

658
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.745
Okay?

659
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:27.249
Go help your mom.

660
00:36:51.388 --> 00:36:53.173
What are you doin' out here?

661
00:36:56.852 --> 00:36:58.654
Well. you belong to someone.

662
00:37:01.032 --> 00:37:02.927
Someone out here maybe?

663
00:37:07.403 --> 00:37:10.014
You live out here
with someone. buddy?

664
00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:11.666
It's okay.

665
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:14.014
It's okay.

666
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:18.404
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

667
00:37:18.515 --> 00:37:20.517
I just wanna get
a closer look.

668
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.019
Hey! Hey! Hey!

669
00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:35.082
Hey!

670
00:37:38.712 --> 00:37:41.406
What the...

671
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:48.367
No.

672
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:50.446
No. no.

673
00:38:04.788 --> 00:38:08.095
Fuck!

674
00:38:28.747 --> 00:38:30.401
What?

675
00:38:54.135 --> 00:38:55.711
What the...

676
00:40:21.432 --> 00:40:23.521
Luck. not skill.

677
00:40:27.742 --> 00:40:30.127
Sheriff Stevens.

678
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.956
Heard you had a rough go of it
last night.

679
00:40:34.692 --> 00:40:37.172
Sorry about Father Khatri.

680
00:40:37.717 --> 00:40:39.719
Oh. I appreciate that.

681
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.957
I. uh...

682
00:40:43.843 --> 00:40:47.629
Not sure if you heard.
but I'm setting off today.

683
00:40:47.792 --> 00:40:49.750
Gonna find us a way
outta this place.

684
00:40:50.169 --> 00:40:52.492
So. in other words. you're about
to go off into the woods

685
00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:55.039
with no idea
what you're looking for.

686
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:57.563
Because that worked
so well last time.

687
00:40:57.648 --> 00:40:58.562
Hey.

688
00:40:58.647 --> 00:41:00.170
Right?

689
00:41:00.255 --> 00:41:02.172
Fatima. would you
give us a second?

690
00:41:02.257 --> 00:41:04.085
Yeah. of course.

691
00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:05.800
Thank you.

692
00:41:13.821 --> 00:41:16.476
You wanna be angry with me.

693
00:41:16.863 --> 00:41:19.344
you wanna hate me. that's fine.

694
00:41:20.922 --> 00:41:23.091
But I'm gonna say
a couple things and. uh.

695
00:41:23.222 --> 00:41:27.269
and you're gonna listen.
whether you want to or not.

696
00:41:29.402 --> 00:41:31.534
Go ahead.

697
00:41:31.665 --> 00:41:33.104
If something happens
to me out there.

698
00:41:33.188 --> 00:41:37.192
if I don't... make it back.

699
00:41:37.323 --> 00:41:40.891
I never want you to regret
what you didn't say.

700
00:41:43.111 --> 00:41:45.809
I never want you to feel...

701
00:41:48.203 --> 00:41:51.554
I won't be here to
tell you that it's okay.

702
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.430
So. I'm telling you now.

703
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.434
Man. it's okay.

704
00:42:01.564 --> 00:42:05.612
And that you are my son.

705
00:42:05.742 --> 00:42:07.266
Mine.

706
00:42:08.832 --> 00:42:11.574
I love you.

707
00:42:11.705 --> 00:42:15.274
and I am proud of the man
that you have become.

708
00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:21.062
And not a single day goes by
when that hasn't been true.

709
00:42:24.195 --> 00:42:25.849
Okay?

710
00:42:29.766 --> 00:42:31.725
Yeah.

711
00:42:31.855 --> 00:42:34.423
Yeah. it's okay.

712
00:42:34.554 --> 00:42:36.295
Okay.

713
00:42:42.213 --> 00:42:43.867
Okay.

714
00:42:54.617 --> 00:42:57.054
How'd that go?

715
00:42:57.185 --> 00:42:59.492
About as well
as could be expected.

716
00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:02.016
He'll come 'round.

717
00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:05.769
You really going?

718
00:43:07.587 --> 00:43:09.023
Looks like.

719
00:43:11.504 --> 00:43:15.029
You and me. we've had our
differences. but I just. uh...

720
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.120
Thank you...

721
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.079
for looking after him.

722
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.516
You've done
something I couldn't.

723
00:43:23.646 --> 00:43:25.561
You did enough. Boyd.

724
00:43:25.692 --> 00:43:29.826
You did more than anyone
should ever have to.

725
00:43:29.957 --> 00:43:32.307
So. you come back. okay?

726
00:43:32.438 --> 00:43:34.918
Who the hell else
am I gonna argue with?

727
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.878
Sure you'll find someone.

728
00:43:38.008 --> 00:43:39.053
Fuck off.

729
00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.924
- What?
- Come on.

730
00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.227
Now. get the fuck outta here

731
00:43:45.312 --> 00:43:47.664
before people start
thinking we're friends.

732
00:43:47.888 --> 00:43:49.019
Yes. ma'am.

733
00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:02.000
I'm gonna say something to you
that might make you hate me.

734
00:44:02.192 --> 00:44:04.455
and if it does. that's okay.

735
00:44:06.472 --> 00:44:09.649
What happened
wasn't your Dad's fault.

736
00:44:09.779 --> 00:44:12.826
and it wasn't yours.
It was this place.

737
00:44:12.956 --> 00:44:17.308
I wasn't here. I may not have
seen it. but I know your Dad.

738
00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:19.746
I know that if
there was anything.

739
00:44:19.876 --> 00:44:22.444
anything else he could've done.
he would've done it.

740
00:44:24.751 --> 00:44:28.407
What happened was so awful...

741
00:44:28.537 --> 00:44:32.628
it's almost inconceivable.
and it fills you with rage.

742
00:44:32.759 --> 00:44:34.413
rage that you needed
to put somewhere.

743
00:44:34.543 --> 00:44:37.154
And this whole time.
your dad let you put it on him

744
00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:40.419
because that's what parents do.

745
00:44:40.806 --> 00:44:43.548
But did you. for a second.
stop to consider

746
00:44:43.633 --> 00:44:46.310
what that day was like for him.

747
00:44:46.425 --> 00:44:50.994
what he's carried every
second of every day since?

748
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:00.439
If you don't get up
and go after him right now.

749
00:45:00.524 --> 00:45:03.832
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

750
00:45:37.388 --> 00:45:38.564
What's...

751
00:45:40.612 --> 00:45:41.918
Babe?

752
00:45:43.743 --> 00:45:45.266
Ab?

753
00:45:48.748 --> 00:45:50.532
What's happening. Abs?

754
00:45:51.473 --> 00:45:53.278
What's going on. Abs?

755
00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:59.321
Abs?

756
00:45:59.406 --> 00:46:00.842

Ab...

759
00:46:06.498 --> 00:46:09.544
Please.
Please. why are you doing this?

760
00:46:09.907 --> 00:46:11.292
It's okay.

761
00:46:11.681 --> 00:46:14.817
It's not real.
It's a nightmare.

762
00:46:14.948 --> 00:46:18.299
The only way for us to go home
is to wake everyone up.

763
00:46:19.884 --> 00:46:21.737
It's okay.
You can't die in dreams.

764
00:46:21.868 --> 00:46:23.217
Everything's gonna be okay.

765
00:46:23.548 --> 00:46:25.654

Abby. stop! Stop!

766
00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:27.264

I found something.

769
00:46:33.401 --> 00:46:34.800
s-something I think
is gonna help us.

770
00:46:34.884 --> 00:46:36.840
You didn't come back
before it got dark.

771
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.808
There's no way you could
have survived out there.

772
00:46:38.892 --> 00:46:40.800
not if it was real.

773
00:46:41.419 --> 00:46:42.986
Yeah.

774
00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:47.330
It's time to wake up.
It's time to wake everybody up.

Ellis. what are

784
00:48:04.569 --> 00:48:06.789
Um...

785
00:48:07.581 --> 00:48:10.003
I've been following you
since you left town.

786
00:48:10.183 --> 00:48:12.708
I've been. um...

787
00:48:12.838 --> 00:48:15.495
I've been trying to find the
courage to say something to you.

788
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.105
Look. last night. when. uh.

789
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.860
those things got inside
of Colony House.

790
00:48:22.945 --> 00:48:26.775
Fatima and I.
we would've died.

791
00:48:28.003 --> 00:48:30.745
I mean. there was no way
that we could've survived that.

792
00:48:33.031 --> 00:48:36.159
But the one thing that saved us.

793
00:48:37.659 --> 00:48:39.704
that saved her...

794
00:48:41.449 --> 00:48:43.408
was the talisman on the door.

795
00:48:50.076 --> 00:48:54.698
I've just been so angry
for a really long time...

796
00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.504
...and I. uh...

797
00:49:02.794 --> 00:49:04.597
I didn't know how to...

798
00:49:07.099 --> 00:49:10.145
But. you know. if you
didn't do what you did.

799
00:49:11.527 --> 00:49:14.835
if you didn't bring
those talismans back...

800
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.288
It wasn't your fault. Dad.

801
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.370
What Mom did.
it wasn't...

802
00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:31.724
It wasn't your fault.

803
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.925
Look. I'm sorry.
Yeah. I'm so sorry. Dad.

804
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.077
I'm so sorry.

805
00:49:40.162 --> 00:49:42.991
No. no. no. hey.
Hey. no.

806
00:49:44.017 --> 00:49:46.495
It's okay. It's all right.

807
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.862
I just... I just didn't
want you to leave

808
00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:50.165
without saying goodbye.

809
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.904
This is not goodbye.

810
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.822
Okay? You hear me? Huh?

811
00:49:55.136 --> 00:49:57.225
This is not goodbye.

812
00:49:57.355 --> 00:49:58.226
Okay.

813
00:49:58.356 --> 00:49:59.923
All right.

814
00:50:05.189 --> 00:50:06.190
Hey.

815
00:50:08.402 --> 00:50:09.707
What is she doing here?

816
00:50:09.846 --> 00:50:12.370
Look. I need
to take her with me. Okay?

817
00:50:12.501 --> 00:50:14.035
Wait. no. you know
what she tried to do!

818
00:50:14.119 --> 00:50:15.941
No. no. no! Hey. look. look.
I need to take her with me

819
00:50:16.025 --> 00:50:18.137
'cause she might be helpful
for us to find out

820
00:50:18.222 --> 00:50:20.394
what we're looking
for out there. okay?

821
00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:23.238
I will explain everything
to you when I get back.

822
00:50:23.323 --> 00:50:24.933
We'll have a long conversation.

823
00:50:25.018 --> 00:50:26.948
hopefully on our way
outta this place.

824
00:50:27.033 --> 00:50:30.950
But for now. right now. I just
need you to trust me. okay?

825
00:50:31.035 --> 00:50:33.211
Okay. no one can
know she's with me.

826
00:50:33.578 --> 00:50:35.014
Can you do that for me?

827
00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:37.884
Can you trust me?

828
00:50:41.966 --> 00:50:43.707
Just come back.

829
00:50:44.009 --> 00:50:45.554
Yes. sir.

830
00:50:45.936 --> 00:50:47.501
All right.

831
00:50:48.155 --> 00:50:49.988
Go on. Go.

832
00:50:51.194 --> 00:50:52.500
I love you.

833
00:50:54.786 --> 00:50:56.092
I love you. too.

834
00:50:56.216 --> 00:50:58.436
Okay.

835
00:51:03.214 --> 00:51:04.912
Yeah.

836
00:51:11.732 --> 00:51:13.729
Look. we're in a tight spot.

837
00:51:14.555 --> 00:51:16.905
No one's gonna
pretend otherwise.

838
00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:20.438
But Sheriff Boyd
is risking everything for us

839
00:51:20.523 --> 00:51:22.351
out there in the forest.

840
00:51:22.436 --> 00:51:24.143
The least we can do is...

841
00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:26.843
keep ourselves
together while he does.

842
00:51:27.576 --> 00:51:29.516
So that means that we're gonna
do things a little differently

843
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.775
going forwards.

844
00:51:31.203 --> 00:51:33.639
No more Colony House.
no more town.

845
00:51:33.999 --> 00:51:37.258
We're a community. so...

846
00:51:37.586 --> 00:51:40.502
we do this together.

847
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.542
All you Colony House folk.

848
00:51:42.627 --> 00:51:44.846
I don't want any of you
being shitty houseguests.

849
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:48.684
Now. we're gonna get
the house put back together.

850
00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:50.359
but first of all.

851
00:51:50.444 --> 00:51:53.341
Jim here has an idea about
a way we might be able to get

852
00:51:53.471 --> 00:51:55.386
a signal to folks
back in the world.

853
00:51:55.523 --> 00:51:58.062
So we can either
put our energy towards

854
00:51:58.147 --> 00:52:00.320
boarding up a bunch
of broken windows.

855
00:52:00.405 --> 00:52:02.937
or we can help build
something that gets us all

856
00:52:03.022 --> 00:52:05.134
out of this shithole.

857
00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:06.792
Jim?

858
00:52:10.424 --> 00:52:14.276
Well. we're gonna need supplies.

859
00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:16.577
anything we can get
our hands on.

860
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:20.237
We're gonna need batteries.
anything with a charge.

861
00:52:20.368 --> 00:52:23.501
But most of all.
we're gonna need people.

862
00:52:23.632 --> 00:52:26.330
The sooner we get this built.

863
00:52:26.461 --> 00:52:28.332
the sooner we can all go home.
