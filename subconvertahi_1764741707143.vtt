Blood. black bile. yellow bile.

219
00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:15.208
[father] Average male heart. Weight?

220

Eight to ten ounces.

Why do you suppose that is?

224
00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:29.750
Difference in mass in female heart?

225
00:13:30.416 --> 00:13:31.666
Depth of emotion?

You understand?

The main function of the tricuspid valve

238
00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:16.916
is to prevent the reflux of blood
into the vena cava.

239

No. not your hands. Not anymore.

as immodestly as gods.

364
00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:05.625
we must. at the very least.
deliver miracles.

365
00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:07.250
Wouldn't you say?

366
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.351
- Ignite a divine spark...
- [battery crackles]

367
00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:12.434
...in these young students' minds.

368
00:22:12.458 --> 00:22:15.684
Teach them defiance rather than obedience.

369
00:22:15.708 --> 00:22:21.434
Show that man may pursue nature
to her hiding places and stop death.

370
00:22:21.458 --> 00:22:24.434
Not slow it down. but stop it entirely!

371
00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:26.541
[men applauding and murmuring]

372
00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:33.351
Silence. Silence!

373
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.958
[chatter and applause stop]

374
00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:42.333
How exactly do you propose
to teach what is impossible?

375
00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:46.559
[men exclaiming]

376
00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:48.142
[Victor] Composite subject. the body.

377
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:51.375
That of a shopkeeper.
delivered mere moments after expiration.

378
00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:53.517
The brain laid bare but functional.

379
00:22:53.541 --> 00:22:56.166
the spinal branches
and vagal nerves intact.

380
00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:59.017
You may observe the hair-thin scars.

381
00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:01.726
No coarse stitching needed
by my own technique.

382
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.976
The arm. you see.

383
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.601
comes from another specimen.
that of a carpenter.

384
00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:08.833
The muscles. ligaments.
nerves. all connected now.

385
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:10.958
[batteries thrumming]

386
00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:27.559
[gasping hoarsely]

387
00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:29.083
[men exclaiming]

388
00:23:30.083 --> 00:23:32.017
Now. the spasmodic movement of the body

389
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:34.601
caused from the electric current.
this is not new.

390
00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:37.684
It's not new. However.
the flow of energy through the body

391
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:39.351
follows a different notion entirely.

392
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:41.809
- An Eastern notion called qi.
- [continues gasping]

393
00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:45.101
Now. it considers the vital flow of energy
both within and without.

394
00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:46.851
I'm utilizing needles in six--

395
00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:48.767
- [gavel rapping]
- Quiet!

396
00:23:48.791 --> 00:23:51.041
Sit down!

397
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.017
This is a hearing. Doctor.
not a carnival act.

398
00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:58.059
You're not helping your cause. Victor.

399
00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:00.726
This galvanic trickery will simply not do.

400
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.833
Trickery.

401
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:04.750
Trickery?

402
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:08.166
Are you sure?

403
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.750
[men exclaiming]

404
00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:15.726
- That is not trickery. That is a decision.
- [scattered applause]

405
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:20.142
Motor coordination between the eye
of one dead man and the arm of another.

406
00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:23.767
infused with a new will
and the rudiments of understanding.

407
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:27.500
Understanding in a brain
that already died?

408
00:24:28.541 --> 00:24:29.666
Release now.

409
00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:31.875
- [knocks]
- Please.

410
00:24:33.458 --> 00:24:35.418
- "Please" always helps.
- [applause and laughter]

411
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.142
Turn that off at once.
At once. you charlatan.

412
00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:42.101
This is the future. This is possible.

413
00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:44.267
Why not study it? Why not quantify it?

414
00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:46.934
This is unholy.

415
00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:49.017
An abomination.

416
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:50.267
An obscenity!

417
00:24:50.291 --> 00:24:51.226
[men booing]

418
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.892
God gives life. and God takes it. Victor.

419
00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:58.476
Perhaps God is inept!

420
00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.809
[men cheering]

421
00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:02.309
And it is we that must amend his mistakes!

422
00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:04.934
Do not let these old fools
extinguish your voice!

423
00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:08.392
The answers only come
when coaxed by disobedience.

424
00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:11.416
free of fear and cowardly dogma!

425
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:16.375
- [gasping deeply]
- [instrument clatters]

426
00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:20.875
[wheezing]

427
00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:23.458
[stops breathing]

428
00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:27.142
Professor Krempe.

429
00:25:27.166 --> 00:25:30.333
- [men cheering]
- [uplifting classical music playing]

430
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.125
[noisy chatter]

431
00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.666
[pigs squealing]

432
00:26:02.041 --> 00:26:05.851
Baron Frankenstein.
my name is Heinrich Harlander.

433
00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:08.684
and I carry with me
a letter of introduction

434
00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:10.142
from your brother. William.

435
00:26:10.166 --> 00:26:11.184
From my brother?

436
00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:13.642
I asked for the privilege
of your acquaintance.

437
00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:15.601
It won't take but a minute of your time.

438
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:16.875
- Please.
- Very well.

439
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:19.476
[flies buzzing]

440
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.708
[Victor] So William is coming
to see me. is that it?

441
00:26:22.458 --> 00:26:24.166
Yeah. in a matter of days.

442
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:29.125
He wants to introduce you to his fiancée.
My niece. as it happens.

443
00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:36.184
Elizabeth Harlander.
a very nice young lady.

444
00:26:36.208 --> 00:26:37.541
fresh from convent life.

445
00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:39.416
The photographs are mine.

446
00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:43.017
William has become
quite successful in the world of finance.

447
00:26:43.041 --> 00:26:44.809
He's making a name for himself.

448
00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:47.000
Ha! A name? For himself?

449
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.541
Well. I'm afraid we both share that name.
whether we like it or not.

450
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:54.833
I read your article in <i>The Lancet.</i>

451
00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:57.166
You really believe you can do it?

452
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.375
Assemble a man?

453
00:27:00.583 --> 00:27:03.458
A full new body? And give it life?

454
00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:06.184
You saw it today. didn't you?

455
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:08.601
What I saw was a crucifixion. really.

456
00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:11.309
You were done for
before you uttered a word.

457
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.750
I still showed them.

458
00:27:13.875 --> 00:27:14.684
What?

459
00:27:14.708 --> 00:27:15.708
The truth.

460
00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:18.083
They will forget by suppertime.

461
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.583
Yes. yes. yes.
But what did you think? Hmm?

462
00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:25.625
I thought it was brilliant.

463
00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:28.142
It was. I know.

464
00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:31.017
But you are like a child. so excited.

465
00:27:31.041 --> 00:27:34.208
clutching your new pet so tightly
that you're strangling it.

466
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.458
That is why I worry about you.

467
00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:41.142
Can you contain your fire. Prometheus?

468
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:44.125
Or are you going to
burn your hands before delivering it?

469
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:47.541
Quite.

470
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:51.851
Please do not think me rude.
but my day has proven long enough.

471
00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:55.101
and I believe myself totally unfit
for the company of strangers.

472
00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:56.601
So if there's nothing more--

473
00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:58.625
Oh. but there is. Much more.

474
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:03.642
- [sighs]
- I've taken quarters in Edinburgh.

475
00:28:03.666 --> 00:28:07.142
Three days from now.
we are to meet with William and Elizabeth.

476
00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:10.375
And that evening.
I will change your destiny.

477
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:14.000
I will show you something extraordinary.

478
00:28:15.583 --> 00:28:16.684
[church bell tolling]

479
00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:17.916
[people chattering]

480
00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.309
[fingers snapping]

481
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:35.166
The peach. The peach.
Turn the peach. Turn it.

482
00:28:36.708 --> 00:28:38.333
You bit it again.

483
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:40.833
You're eating the peaches.

484
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.333
This is a memento mori.

485
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:49.392
The peach. symbol of life and youth.
and you bite into it?

486
00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:51.684
- I was hungry. Kiki.
- Don't call me Kiki.

487
00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:53.833
[servant] Baron Victor Frankenstein. sir.

488
00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:57.000
[Harlander] You can leave.

489
00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:58.750
Forgive me.

490
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:01.142
Welcome.

491
00:29:01.166 --> 00:29:02.250
[Victor] Herr Harlander.

492
00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.851
A young art. photography.

493
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.142
[model] Goodbye. Kiki.

494
00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:09.166
Already a passion of mine.

495
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.083
Did you bring the papers?

496
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:13.583
Oh. thank you.

497
00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:19.408
- [chuckles] You're extraordinary.
- [Victor] Thank you.

498
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:21.583
[Harlander] Hmm.

499
00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:27.625
You're using the nervous system
to deliver the surge of energy.

500
00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:29.642
Are you not?

501
00:29:29.666 --> 00:29:30.892
Correct.

502
00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:34.976
And thus the sustainability
of the life force you command

503
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.375
is very brief. wanes. evaporates.

504
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
How so?

505
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.625
At the lecture.
you ended your demonstration out of pride.

506
00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:53.642
But really.
because the galvanic life force

507
00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:55.392
was already fading. was it not?

508
00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:57.101
Are you yourself a surgeon. sir?

509
00:29:57.125 --> 00:30:00.017
Yeah. once upon a time. An army surgeon.

510
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:02.684
Not a particularly skilled one. either.

511
00:30:02.708 --> 00:30:05.934
But it allowed me
to secure the rudiments of my fortune.

512
00:30:05.958 --> 00:30:07.934
I own a few ammunition factories.

513
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:10.875
- An arms merchant.
- A realist.

514
00:30:11.458 --> 00:30:13.309
Are you familiar with the Evelyn Tables?

515
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:15.934
Of course. Acquired by Sir John Evelyn.

516
00:30:15.958 --> 00:30:17.976
there are four planks.
meticulous dissection.

517
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.101
some of the oldest in Europe.
presenting the nerves.

518
00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:22.059
veins and arteries of cadavers. What?

519
00:30:22.083 --> 00:30:24.000
Yes. But there's a fifth one.

520
00:30:24.916 --> 00:30:26.291
The most compelling one.

521
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:33.000
Exquisite. is it not?

522
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.708
- Flesh rendered onto wood.
- [knocks on wood]

523
00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:41.559
The cadaver lies on the plank.
is peeled away layer by layer.

524
00:30:41.583 --> 00:30:45.351
and the remaining tissue is lacquered
with resin onto the wood.

525
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:48.559
- It showcases the lymphatic system.
- Yes.

526
00:30:48.583 --> 00:30:52.601
Muslim medics called it
the secret circulatory system.

527
00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:58.184
It moves a mere three liters of fluid.
but it's a vast network.

528
00:30:58.208 --> 00:31:00.000
- Oh. it's remarkable.
- Yes.

529
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:05.166
Now for us. for you.
the important variation is here.

530
00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:10.267
The ninth configuration. A very delicate.

531
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:13.726
almost ethereal structure
surrounding the heart.

532
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.125
It can distribute. but also store energy.

533
00:31:20.791 --> 00:31:23.226
Yes. if you can access that
without destroying

534
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.017
- the surrounding tissue--
- No. Not through the front.

535
00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:29.250
The back. spinal column.
thoracic curvature.

536
00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:30.809
Of course.

537
00:31:30.833 --> 00:31:36.309
Flow of energy. scarring and regeneration
beyond anyone's imagination.

538
00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:37.708
Life eternal.

539
00:31:39.708 --> 00:31:43.041
I will endow your pursuit
with unlimited resources.

540
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:47.250
And in exchange?

541
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.208
No need to become indelicate.

542
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.750
We're searchers for truth
and transcendence. kindred spirits.

543
00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:58.351
I may in time
ask you for a favor in return.

544
00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:02.434
but it's mostly the privilege to record
your process for posterity.

545
00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:03.666
I work alone.

546
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.142
I'm very quiet.

547
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:09.250
[servant] William Frankenstein
and your niece. Herr Harlander.

548
00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:14.208
I shall consider it.

549
00:32:15.541 --> 00:32:16.625
I'll consider it.

550
00:32:17.958 --> 00:32:18.958
[Harlander] Baron.

551
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:23.208
Don't pretend to be reasonable now.
It would be such a shame.

552
00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:26.041
[huffs softly]

553
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:34.767
[chuckles] Victor.

554
00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:36.142
William!

555
00:32:36.166 --> 00:32:38.684
- Victor.
- Look at you.

556
00:32:38.708 --> 00:32:41.601
[chuckles] My. you've grown.

557
00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:43.208
Through no merit of my own.

558
00:32:44.041 --> 00:32:46.041
May I introduce the woman I'm to marry.

559
00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:48.250
Lady Elizabeth Harlander.

560
00:32:49.666 --> 00:32:52.083
[ethereal classical music playing]

561
00:33:07.916 --> 00:33:09.000
[huffs softly]

562
00:33:09.708 --> 00:33:11.458
Absolutely delighted.

563
00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:19.809
Can't say I was shocked
when you were expelled.

564
00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:22.434
but the manner and virulence
of your expulsion.

565
00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:23.684
uncalled for. I'm sure.

566
00:33:23.708 --> 00:33:25.708
No. it was called for. I earned it.

567
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.142
I made it a point to earn it.
wouldn't you say. Herr Harlander?

568
00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:30.666
It was quite an exit. I assure you.

569
00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:33.392
[William] Why provoke them?

570
00:33:33.416 --> 00:33:37.416
Why not just carry on without calling
attention to yourself in such a manner?

571
00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:41.125
How safe. even by your standards. William.

572
00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:43.250
You almost sound like Father.

573
00:33:44.666 --> 00:33:47.101
He was a most tactful man. our father.

574
00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:50.809
He was precise. discreet. measured.

575
00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:55.351
I. on the other hand. fail to see
why modesty is considered a virtue at all.

576
00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:57.750
Victor's always been
one to harvest attention.

577
00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:01.601
Even as children.
I mitigated his voice by staying silent.

578
00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:04.559
Perhaps too much and far too many times.
wouldn't you say. Victor?

579
00:34:04.583 --> 00:34:06.416
If life can be regenerated.

580
00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:08.184
not as a mere simulation.

581
00:34:08.208 --> 00:34:11.142
but as a divine act by physical.
chemical means.

582
00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:13.000
- why whisper it?
- [Elizabeth chuckles]

583
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
You laugh?

584
00:34:17.375 --> 00:34:19.684
- You're amused?
- I must be. yes.

585
00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.101
Are my ideas not clear?

586
00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:23.642
You certainly expressed them
loudly enough.

587
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.059
[Victor] Are they not worthwhile?

588
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:27.833
Ideas are not worthwhile by themselves.
I don't believe.

589
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.666
Enlighten me. please.

590
00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:34.351
Take the war. for example.

591
00:34:34.375 --> 00:34:37.083
William. cigar and brandy in my study?

592
00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:41.208
Surely you've heard my niece
expound on the matter before.

593
00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:43.458
You'll excuse us.

594
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.333
[Victor] Pray. carry on. Ideas.

595
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:57.333
Well... honor. country. valor.

00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:01.684
These surely are worthwhile.

597
00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:02.750
wouldn't you agree?

598
00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:06.375
- Mm-hmm.
- And nevertheless. men are dying for them.

599
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:08.934
In a decidedly un-elevated way.

600
00:35:08.958 --> 00:35:11.892
face down in the mud. choking on blood.

601
00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:13.208
screaming in pain.

602
00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:17.351
Men that were fathers.
brothers or sons to someone out there.

603
00:35:17.375 --> 00:35:19.351
Men that were fed. cleaned and nursed

604
00:35:19.375 --> 00:35:21.333
and schooled into this world
by their mothers.

605
00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.851
only to fall on a battlefield far away.

606
00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:26.166
far from those that provoke
these tragedies.

607
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:31.291
Those men remain at home.
untouched by blood or bayonet.

608
00:35:32.416 --> 00:35:35.458
their skin unpierced.
their blankets warm and clean.

609
00:35:38.125 --> 00:35:40.851
That is what happens
when ideas are pursued by fools.

610
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:42.708
And you think me a fool?

611
00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:44.541
Hmm?

612
00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:47.916
Run to your brandy and cigars.

613
00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:49.892
The boys are waiting.

614
00:35:49.916 --> 00:35:51.000

he's met an angel or a devil.</i>

<i>only to find it is all an illusion.</i>

617
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.041
The game of chess we play... [coughs]

618
00:36:10.916 --> 00:36:12.726

[coughing]

620
00:36:15.083 --> 00:36:16.166
[in Danish] Help him.

621
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.750
Help him!

622
00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:20.476
[in English] Here you go. Drink some.

623

[door slams open]

627
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:45.368
- [Larsen] You better come with me.
- [sighs in relief]

628
00:36:45.875 --> 00:36:47.309
[Anderson] Nothing.

629
00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:48.916
[Larsen] Sir. the watchman saw him.

630
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:51.434
Circling the ship. In the mist.

631
00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:53.184
We all saw him drown.

632
00:36:53.208 --> 00:36:54.392
Sir.

633
00:36:54.416 --> 00:36:56.017
The men are terrified.

634
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.434
They think that man should be
surrendered to the ice

635
00:36:58.458 --> 00:36:59.708
and be done with this.

636
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:04.416
He is under my protection...

637
00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:08.375

<i>to a lake near Vaduz across the channel.</i>

642
00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:30.934
The tower was built as a water
filtration plant to irrigate the fields.

643

Public works. so construction
was abandoned at the start of the war.

644

Not this war. the one before.

645
00:37:37.541 --> 00:37:39.666

The structure's basically intact.

service for the duration of the project.

661

[Victor] I'll need a holding cell.

662

- And an ice chamber close to the lab.
- [Harlander] William.

663

There are two pump reservoirs
at the base of the tower.

664
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:53.976
We'll repurpose those.

665
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.267
[Victor] We shall need to recondition
the steam engines.

666
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:58.166
We'll need enough fuel
to make sure they run.

667

00:41:59.291 --> 00:42:00.976
Rather uncharitable. wouldn't you say?

715
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.517
Respectfully. Father.
you do not know this man.

716
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:07.059
He tries to control and manipulate
everything and everyone around him.

717
00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:09.767
Like every tyrant.
he delights in playing the victim.

718
00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:11.267
His only advantage. I would say.

719
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:14.000
is he's far cruder
than he believes himself to be.

720
00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:15.934
Cruder?

721
00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:18.309
Uh. pray explain yourself. my child.

722
00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:21.083
For one. he's easy to spot.

723
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.291
You can see him...
even on a busy street on market day.

724
00:42:27.916 --> 00:42:30.291
[whimsical classical music playing]

725
00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:34.017
[Victor] Tell me.
how soon did you spot me?

726
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:36.976
[Elizabeth] I saw you well before
you saw me. I can say that much.

727
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.226
[Victor] Have you had supper?

728
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.059
I'm not that hungry. Baron.
Thank you.

729
00:42:40.083 --> 00:42:41.791
[Victor] Well. I for one am famished.

730
00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:46.517
- Thank you. my good man.
- Thank you. sir.

731
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:48.916
What books did you buy. hmm? May I?

732
00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:51.125
Guess.

733
00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:53.392
- Guess?
- Mm-hmm. I'd rather that you did.

734
00:42:53.416 --> 00:42:54.416
Very well.

735
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.809
A romance... [sniffs]

736
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:04.142

and silk and the skirmishes of love.

737

- Insulting. but unsurprising.
- [chuckles]

738

Really?

739
00:43:15.041 --> 00:43:16.166
- Insects?
- Mm.

740
00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:20.541
My interest in science
leans towards the smallest things.

741
00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:23.958
Moving with nature.
perhaps the rhythms of God.

742
00:43:25.208 --> 00:43:29.416
I've always searched for something
more pure. marvelous.

743
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.208
Is that what you were seeking
in the convent?

744
00:43:37.916 --> 00:43:38.958
In a way.

745
00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:42.125
Was it worth it?

746
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.351
- Is anything?

[softly] This hardly seems appropriate.

[Victor] <i>And for the very first time.</i>

757
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.625
<i>I became more interested in life</i>

758

<i>and somewhat less interested in death.</i>

759
00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:34.541
[classical waltz music continues]

760
00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:55.291
[silversmith] The main rod
has a fast bolting system.

761
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.333
Did you use an alloy?

762
00:44:58.333 --> 00:44:59.851
Copper and zinc.

763
00:44:59.875 --> 00:45:02.750
This is... This simply will not do.
Start over.

764
00:45:03.458 --> 00:45:05.208
Pure silver is a perfect conductor.

765
00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:09.101
William. you must stay behind. Please.

766
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:11.101
I trust you above anyone else.

767
00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:12.416
Only for a few more days.

768

You're not going to catch her. [chuckles]

[Elizabeth laughs]

770
00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:30.476
Beautiful. Beautiful.

771
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.833
- Should we trap her or let her go?
- Mm...

772
00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:34.750
- Trap her.
- [both chuckle]

773
00:45:36.375 --> 00:45:38.083
[Victor] Now we have something in common.

774
00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:40.791
A prisoner.

[Victor] <i>As promised. William took dutiful
charge of the laboratory build and needs.</i>

776

[William] Can you fix that
over there. please?

777
00:45:50.416 --> 00:45:51.500
Go. help.

- [William] It's all pure silver now.
- [metal clangs]

781
00:46:09.625 --> 00:46:13.125
Conduction points
corresponding to the lymphatic system.

782
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.226
which was quite complex.

783
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.226
- But I managed. [chuckles]

Herr Harlander. thank you.
The party's delightful.

792
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.125
I hope we're not distracting you
from your research

to tend to me and Elizabeth.

794
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:12.517
Not at all.

She's young.
She can count on us to guard her.

796
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.434
I shall leave you your privacy.

Ah. yeah. that.

802
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.142
It's been so long.

[finishes urinating]

806
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:47.142
And my funding will end with it.

You said your funds were unlimited.

808

My patience is not.

809
00:47:52.041 --> 00:47:55.750
I have it on good authority that a battle
is to take place within a week.

810
00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:00.934
The tide of war
will deliver its bounty to our shore.

811
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:03.184
A battlefield? The bodies will be mangled.

812
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:04.208
One week.

813
00:48:05.125 --> 00:48:07.958
- One week?
- After that. history will pass us by.

814
00:48:10.666 --> 00:48:12.958

815
00:48:15.583 --> 00:48:19.184

how to deliver the current.</i>

- [knocking continues]

Oh.

00:48:32.458 --> 00:48:33.875
I believe she missed you.

823
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:36.642
[Victor] I must warn you.
Elizabeth.

824
00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:39.041
- I've been working on a dissection.
- It's beautiful.

825
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:42.916
[Victor] Does it shock you?

826
00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:46.250
[Elizabeth] Reminds me
of martyrdom paintings.

- Pain is gone.
- [soft classical music playing]

828

Elizabeth.

830
00:49:00.791 --> 00:49:02.583
I must confess something to you.

831
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.583
I have a belief in the marvelous
and so do you.

832
00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:12.017
There is a bond between us.
Can you feel it?

833
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:15.750
An almost physical one.
I truly believe it to be something else.

[Victor huffs softly]

835
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:26.958

00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:31.583
Then why are you here?

Set that one over there.

892
00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:29.916
Bring the others.

A storm is coming!

[Harlander] My cane.

920

My cane!

921

Mercury.

923
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:29.625
- Are you ill?
- [Harlander] Thank you.

924
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:42.583
Is it... syphilis?

925
00:56:45.375 --> 00:56:46.541
[Harlander] Yeah. I'm dying.

926
00:56:48.708 --> 00:56:51.684
One night with Venus.
a lifetime with Mercury.

927
00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:52.916
Isn't that the phrase?

928
00:56:53.666 --> 00:56:54.684
What stage?

929
00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:55.601
Secondary?

930
00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:58.226
We both know the precise schedule.

931
00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:00.601
It starts to eat away my bones.

932
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:06.309
orbital. cheek. teeth. jaw. skull.
exposing my brain.

933
00:57:06.333 --> 00:57:10.166
Tumors. madness. excruciating pain.

934
00:57:10.958 --> 00:57:12.851
[chuckles] One fine morning.

935
00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:15.833
I will start to scream
and I will never stop.

936
00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:19.750
- I cannot face such a vulgar demise.
- [thunderclap]

937
00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:23.142
Which brings me to my one condition.

938
00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:27.184
Our deal. As agreed. in exchange

939
00:57:27.208 --> 00:57:30.375
for my generous intervention
on your behalf.

940
00:57:31.458 --> 00:57:34.791
And as we give life to our new Adam.

941
00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:37.833
I want to be placed
in this new perfect body.

942
00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:41.500
No.

943
00:57:43.416 --> 00:57:44.934
- No. no.
- Yes.

944
00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:46.892
Not now. Not now!

945
00:57:46.916 --> 00:57:49.892
- Precisely now.
- We'll talk about this after. not now.

946
00:57:49.916 --> 00:57:51.041
There is no after!

947
00:57:52.833 --> 00:57:54.208

I give you everything you ask for.

953
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:45.625
Name it. it's yours.

954
00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:48.000
Even Elizabeth.

955
00:58:50.041 --> 00:58:51.041
Please.

956
00:58:52.208 --> 00:58:53.625
"Please" always helps.

957
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:57.434
The disease has spread all inside of you.

958
00:58:57.458 --> 00:58:59.642
It's systemic. and you know it.

959
00:58:59.666 --> 00:59:01.642
Every organ in you is polluted.

960
00:59:01.666 --> 00:59:03.851
Your brain. your blood. it's all polluted.

961
00:59:03.875 --> 00:59:05.476
But my money's not. is that it?

962
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.583
It's impossible.

963
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:12.250
Now. all you need to say
is one simple word.

964
00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:14.517
"Yes." no more and no less.

965
00:59:14.541 --> 00:59:16.458
No! Do you understand? No!

966
00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:21.291
[thunderclaps continue]

967
00:59:28.208 --> 00:59:29.333

Stop!

969
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.476
Stop.

970
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.934
If we lose that. we have nothing.
We both lose.

971
00:59:34.958 --> 00:59:37.726
I will be the eagle
that feasts on your liver!

972
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:38.916
Please. stop!

973
00:59:39.416 --> 00:59:41.142

This way. like this.

1062

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.208
Key.

1075
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:27.750
[slowly] Victor.

1076
01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:32.184
This will keep you nice and warm.

1077
01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:34.434
Nice blanket to keep you warm.

1078
01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.791
- [slowly] Victor.
- All right.

1079
01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:39.541
You stay.

1080
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:41.916
You stay here now.

1081
01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.291
- [moans softly]
- Stay here now.

1082
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.458
I'll be back. All right. Stay there.

1083
01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:53.351
- Victor.
- [chains rattling]

1084
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:56.416
No. no. no. no. no. It's all right.

1085
01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.083
I'll come back.

1086
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.392
- Victor.
- [sentimental classical music playing]

1087
01:07:07.416 --> 01:07:08.500
Victor.

1088
01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.500
[Victor] <i>Everything was new to him.</i>

1089
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.750
<i>Warmth. cold. light. darkness.</i>

1090
01:07:17.541 --> 01:07:19.541
<i>And I was there to mold him.</i>

1091
01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:23.625
<i>I never considered
what would come after creation.</i>

1092
01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.958
<i>And having reached the edge of the earth.</i>

1093
01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:30.375
<i>there was no horizon left.</i>

1094
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:35.875
<i>The achievement felt unnatural.</i>

1095
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:41.958
<i>Void of meaning.</i>

1096
01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:46.375
<i>And this troubled me so.</i>

1097
01:07:47.666 --> 01:07:49.892
Your men. they wish to go back.

1098
01:07:49.916 --> 01:07:51.351
Yes?

1099
01:07:51.375 --> 01:07:52.666
Probably.

1100
01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:57.059
But the moment we're free.
we're setting sails forwards.

1101
01:07:57.083 --> 01:07:58.434
No matter the cost.

1102
01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:00.041
You share my madness.

1103
01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:02.809
[chuckles hollowly]

1104
01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:06.142
Perhaps there is a finer point
in me telling you my story.

1105
01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.291
Whether there is or isn't. Baron...

1106
01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:12.458
I'd like to hear it.

1107
01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.267
[Victor] <i>Weeks passed.</i>

1108
01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:20.083
<i>and as his strength increased rapidly.
mine waned.</i>

1109
01:08:20.708 --> 01:08:24.166
<i>Alas. no further language
or development occurred.</i>

1110
01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:26.833
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1111
01:08:27.833 --> 01:08:30.083
Down. down. down. down.

1112
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:31.625
Yes. there we are.

1113
01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.833
There we are. Stay there. Stay.

1114
01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:37.101
[Victor sighs]

1115
01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:38.208
Yes. that's you.

1116
01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:40.583
That's you. All right?

1117
01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:48.666
Oh. yes. this is healing rather nicely.

1118
01:08:50.666 --> 01:08:51.750
I'm tired.

1119
01:08:53.875 --> 01:08:55.333
I have not slept.

1120
01:08:56.833 --> 01:09:00.958
Not a winky-dinky-doo of sleep for me.

1121
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.958
Tending to you.

1122
01:09:03.916 --> 01:09:05.309
I've finished shaving you.

1123
01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:07.166
[moaning softly]

1124
01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:12.476
No. no. stop. stop.

1125
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.892
- Let go. No. no. no. no. no. no. Open.
- [blood trickling]

1126
01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:17.083
Open your hand. Open. Open it.

1127
01:09:18.916 --> 01:09:19.916
[sighs]

1128
01:09:21.125 --> 01:09:22.333
What are you doing?

1129
01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.642
Look. Look what you've done.

1130
01:09:24.666 --> 01:09:27.791
You have to listen to me.
You have to listen. I said drop it.

1131
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.291
Stupidity! No. Stop.

1132
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.059
Come here.

1133
01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:35.559
- Victor.
- No. don't touch me!

1134
01:09:35.583 --> 01:09:37.083
Don't ever touch me!

1135
01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:45.125
Come here.

1136
01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:47.833
I didn't do this. You did this.

1137
01:09:49.416 --> 01:09:51.125
[inhales sharply]

1138
01:09:53.208 --> 01:09:54.291
The wound.

1139
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:56.541
It's closed.

1140
01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:58.476
But how?

1141
01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.791
[subject grunts]

1142
01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:02.791
- [growling softly]
- All right.

1143
01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:07.291
- [continues growling]
- No. no. no.

1144
01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:09.666
No.

1145
01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:12.791
No.

1146
01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:16.833
- All right. All right.
- [stops growling]

1147
01:10:18.791 --> 01:10:19.791
[horse whinnies]

1148
01:10:23.666 --> 01:10:25.291
I'm sure everything's all right.

1149
01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:29.559
We'll be there soon enough.

1150
01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:30.666
[cuff clangs]

1151
01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:33.767
I know you have thoughts. I know.

1152
01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:35.017
I know you do.

1153
01:10:35.041 --> 01:10:37.726
Somewhere in there.
Somewhere in there you have thoughts.

1154
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.791
Hmm? Don't you?

1155
01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:41.767
Something you might want to say?

1156
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:43.875
However jumbled. however confused?

1157
01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:45.625
Hmm? Something?

1158
01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:47.517
Am I presuming too much?

1159
01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:48.642
Victor.

1160
01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:51.767
Yes. yes. yes. yes. yes!

1161
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:53.726
This much we have established.

1162
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.017
That is my name. My name is Victor.

1163
01:10:56.041 --> 01:10:59.208
Is there anything else that you can say?
Anything at all? Hmm?

1164
01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:01.976
Anything? Anything?

1165
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.958
Um. sun. hmm?

1166
01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:08.892
Cold. Rain. Blood. Anything.

1167
01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:10.875
Boot. Can you say "boot"?

1168
01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:12.559
Victor.

1169
01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:14.142
[Victor laughs in frustration]

1170
01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:17.142
No. yes. no. yes! How about...

1171
01:11:17.166 --> 01:11:18.934
How about "hand"? Can you say "hand"?

1172
01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:21.750
- Hand. Hand.
- [growls]

1173
01:11:24.666 --> 01:11:27.333
Oh. Oh. oh. You are afraid of me?

1174
01:11:28.625 --> 01:11:30.226
You're afraid of me?

1175
01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:32.559
Why? Why would you be afraid of me?

1176
01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:34.041
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:36.416
I'm not going to hurt you. I made you.

1178
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.267
I'm your maker! Stop it!

1179
01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:40.458
- [whimpering]
- [muffled banging on door]

1180
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:49.666
[breathing heavily]

1181
01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:55.208
Oh.

1182
01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:58.291
You're here. You're really here.

1183
01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:00.875
Come on. then. Come. come.

1184
01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:04.892
I have to tell you.
I have so much to show you. Elizabeth.

1185
01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:06.892
You won't believe it.
It's absolutely marvelous.

1186
01:12:06.916 --> 01:12:08.601
Come. come.
I'll show you my notes first.

1187
01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.208
Is my uncle here?

1188
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
What?

1189
01:12:12.666 --> 01:12:13.851
My uncle. is he here?

1190
01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:14.875
No. no.

1191
01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:17.059
No. I'm alone. He's not here.

1192
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:19.934
- He's... He'll be back in a few days.
- You don't look very well. Victor.

1193
01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:22.833
Oh. I've never felt better!
I've never had a clearer mind! Come. come!

1194
01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:24.541
Are you running a fever?

1195
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.517
I am just very excited
to see you. [chuckles]

1196
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:29.976
I'm exalted.
The spirits have lifted me so much.

1197
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.250
Absolutely marvelous...

1198
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:34.416
[in distance] Victor...

1199
01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:39.458
[William] Victor. Victor.
[continues indistinctly]

1200
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.583
- [gentle ethereal music playing]
- [chain rattling]

1201
01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:37.958
[gentle ethereal music continues]

1202
01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:56.583
- [Elizabeth breathing shakily]
- [grunting softly]

1203
01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:22.125
[chuckles softly]

1204
01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:37.291
[Elizabeth gasping softly]

1205
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.875
Who hurt you?

1206
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.500
I have to show you this. William.

1207
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:00.017
Let me organize it for you.

1208
01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:02.333
And I have something to show to you.

1209
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.000
I've spoken to the Royal Medical Society.

1210
01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:09.166
- They're interested in seeing you.
- No. no. no. not yet.

1211
01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:11.083
I'm not quite ready yet.

1212
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:14.392
[William] I thought
that's what you always wanted.

1213
01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:16.208
[Elizabeth panting]

1214
01:15:18.416 --> 01:15:19.541
The man.

1215
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.208
- The man downstairs.
- You saw him?

1216
01:15:22.916 --> 01:15:25.166
Is he a patient? A victim?

1217
01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:29.184
His wounds. You wounded him like that.

1218
01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:31.976
No. no. no. It was the world
that hurt him. Elizabeth.

1219
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.791
I... I gave him life.

1220
01:15:35.416 --> 01:15:37.291
I gave him life.

1221
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.041
Up. up. up.

1222
01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:41.875
Come on.

1223
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.226
There. there. there...

1224
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.541
He's still getting
used to his surroundings.

1225
01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:50.416
- [low growl]
- [Victor shushes]

1226
01:15:51.125 --> 01:15:53.142
It is strong. William.

1227
01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:55.125
- You did it.
- [Victor] It's so strong.

1228
01:15:55.791 --> 01:15:56.791
You did it.

1229
01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:59.101
All its systems are functional.

1230
01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.333
- All healing.
- [neck cracks]

1231
01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:04.583
And the healing is erratic. yes.

1232
01:16:05.083 --> 01:16:06.916
- But exceptional.
- [groans softly]

1233
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.125
[chain clangs]

1234
01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:16.101
Why is he chained here?

1235
01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.851
For his own safety and for mine.

1236
01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:21.601
and it's easy to clean
and. uh. maintain it.

1237
01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.291
And it doesn't know any better.

1238
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.500
But you do.

1239
01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:29.916
Does Harlander know?

1240
01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:34.976
We have to prepare everything
for the moment he returns.

1241
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.875
- [Victor] Of course.
- And have everything presentable.

1242
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.500
Is it intelligent?

1243
01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:48.125
Victor. is it intelligent?

1244
01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:01.333
[thunder rumbling]

1245
01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:05.250
[William] I can't fathom
how exactly you did what you did.

1246
01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:07.750
but its dimension does not escape me.

1247
01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:14.000
Victor. did you ever ask yourself.

1248
01:17:15.041 --> 01:17:16.916
of all the parts that make that man.

1249
01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.500
which one holds the soul?

1250
01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:27.958
No. I didn't.

1251
01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:32.541
[William] There's something so disquieting
about that creature down there.

1252
01:17:33.208 --> 01:17:36.500
Askew. like a figure peeking around
a funhouse mirror.

1253
01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:38.458
But animated.

1254
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.434
Animated by what?

1255
01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:43.375
- [gentle classical music playing]
- [chain rattling]

1256
01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:29.541
[grunts softly]

1257
01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:34.250
[gentle classical music continues]

1258
01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:38.375
[chain clanks]

1259
01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:43.476
[thunder rumbles]

1260
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.226
[groans softly]

1261
01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.375
Does it hurt?

1262
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:55.500
A leaf?

1263
01:18:55.958 --> 01:18:56.958
For me?

1264
01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:58.958
Thank you.

1265
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:04.375
Isn't it beautiful?

1266
01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:06.875
This is for me?

1267
01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:09.958
I'm Elizabeth.

1268
01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:13.583
Can you say "Elizabeth"?

1269
01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:15.291
Elizabeth.

1270
01:19:16.625 --> 01:19:19.166
My throat makes sounds.

1271
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:20.833
Elizabeth.

1272
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:38.916
I'm going to go now.

1273
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:56.958
Eliza... beth.

1274
01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:00.583
[Victor] You should not go near it.

1275
01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:03.666
"It"?

1276
01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:07.666
It. Yes.

1277
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.851
I believe there is life in it.

1278
01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:13.434
but not the spark of intelligence
that I had intended.

1279
01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:15.142
Perhaps not as you understand it.

1280
01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:16.851
Something went wrong.

1281
01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:19.351
A blockage. a suture. a connection.

1282
01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:21.934
You. the great Victor Frankenstein.
you made a mistake?

1283
01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:24.226
The Creature knows but one word.
and one word alone.

1284
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:26.267
"Victor. Victor. Victor. Victor."

1285
01:20:26.291 --> 01:20:28.851
It just parrots it
without rhyme or reason.

1286
01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:31.934
Perhaps for the time being
that word means everything to him.

1287
01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:35.351
What if in being anew.
the spirit that animates him is simpler.

1288
01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:36.601
- purer--
- [scoffs] Purer?

1289
01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:39.291
- Purer than that of the common man?
- [laughing]

1290
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:44.892
What if. unrestrained by sin.

1291
01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:47.851
our creator's breath came
into its wounded flesh directly?

1292
01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:50.083
Good God. Elizabeth.

1293
01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:54.017
If I could force myself to believe it.

1294
01:20:54.041 --> 01:20:58.142
it would be my inclination to see
attraction in you for that thing.

1295
01:20:58.166 --> 01:20:59.625
Understanding.

1296
01:21:00.625 --> 01:21:01.892
In those eyes I saw pain.

1297
01:21:01.916 --> 01:21:04.017
and what is pain
if not evidence of intelligence?

1298
01:21:04.041 --> 01:21:05.809
What about my pain?

1299
01:21:05.833 --> 01:21:07.458
What about what you have denied me?

1300
01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:10.500
What my heart wants...

1301
01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:13.625
Your heart? [chuckling quietly]

1302
01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:17.642
Of all the human anatomy.

1303
01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:20.333
that is the organ
furthest from your understanding.

1304
01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.708
Only monsters play God. Baron.

1305
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.142
[metal clatters]

1306
01:21:29.166 --> 01:21:32.000
[Victor] Purer than the common man. hmm?

1307
01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:34.083
[Victor chuckles]

1308
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.500
And I. somehow. the villain. Mm-hmm.

1309
01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.625
Your heart is pure?

1310
01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:44.916
I assure you it isn't.

1311
01:21:45.416 --> 01:21:47.125
I should know. I put it there.

1312
01:21:47.625 --> 01:21:48.625
Up.

1313
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:00.958
Let us try again.

1314
01:22:04.208 --> 01:22:05.291
Now give me your leg.

1315
01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:07.166
Leg!

1316
01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:09.416
- [gasps]
- Give me your leg!

1317
01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:12.750
Pain is evidence of intelligence.
is it not?

1318
01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:15.517
- Well. let's test the theory.
- [grunts]

1319
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.458
Give me your leg!

1320
01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:19.208
Leg!

1321
01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:20.976
Leg!

1322
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.851
- Come on!
- [gasps]

1323
01:22:22.875 --> 01:22:24.166
Give it to me. you beast!

1324
01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:28.041
- [whimpering softly]
- Give me your leg!

1325
01:22:28.791 --> 01:22:29.934
[growls softly]

1326
01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:31.041
Leg!

1327
01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:33.541
[roars]

1328
01:22:34.125 --> 01:22:35.708
- [rod clatters]
- Victor!

1329
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:38.916
Victor!

1330
01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:46.291
Victor! Victor!

1331
01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:47.958
What is it. Victor?

1332
01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.434
Come. Come. [breathing heavily]

1333
01:22:51.458 --> 01:22:53.916
I failed. I made a mistake.

1334
01:22:54.666 --> 01:22:56.642
- No. you didn't fail. I saw your papers.
- I did.

1335
01:22:56.666 --> 01:22:58.767
- It's perfect.
- The Creature is extremely dangerous.

1336
01:22:58.791 --> 01:23:00.625
There's not... Victor.

1337
01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:03.101
Let's wait for Harlander
and discuss together.

1338
01:23:03.125 --> 01:23:05.541
William. there is something
you should know.

1339
01:23:06.333 --> 01:23:07.601
Something I have to show you.

1340
01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:08.625
[door opens]

1341
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:16.375
- [William] Ha-- Harlander...
- In a fit of rage. he killed him.

1342
01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.375
[William breathing shakily]

1343
01:23:22.708 --> 01:23:25.875
Do you understand now
why I was hesitant to share this with you?

1344
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.208
And certainly not with Elizabeth.

1345
01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:33.500
S... So what's to be done now?

1346
01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:34.934
What?

1347
01:23:34.958 --> 01:23:36.642
- What's to be done?
- "What's to be done"?

1348
01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:38.434
You must take Elizabeth back to Vienna.

1349
01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:41.767
Tell her something urgent came up
and you have to leave immediately.

1350
01:23:41.791 --> 01:23:43.250
Keep her in the dark.

1351
01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:46.059
For her own safety.

1352
01:23:46.083 --> 01:23:47.559
You have to do as I say.

1353
01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:50.458
We'll be back in no time.
But for now. this is for the best.

1354
01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:53.750
Now get in the carriage. please.

1355
01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.916
The Creature.
what's its lifespan. you think?

1356
01:24:09.916 --> 01:24:12.666
Brief. Very brief. I'm sure.

1357
01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:19.208
[suspenseful music playing]

1358
01:24:59.375 --> 01:25:01.125
I have the most terrible feeling.

1359
01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:06.375
What is it?

1360
01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:08.958
Turn the carriage around.

1361
01:25:10.083 --> 01:25:11.500
You go to Vienna.

1362
01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:15.916
Turn the carriage around or I will jump.
He's going to kill him.

1363
01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:23.958
[can clatters]

1364
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.017
Say one word.

1365
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:28.583
One word more. Anything.

1366
01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:30.583
Make me save you.

1367
01:25:35.916 --> 01:25:37.767
- Victor.
- Mm-hmm.

1368
01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:40.041
[suspenseful music continues]

1369
01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:46.958
Elizabeth.

[Victor] <i>But that was not the end of it.</i>

1387
01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:37.083
In seeking life. I created death.

- [knocking]
- [urgent shouting from outside]

1389
01:27:43.333 --> 01:27:45.958
It would seem
I need to address my men again.

[grunting]

1391
01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:51.208
Don't worry.

1392
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
They'll listen to me.

Do not harm him! I'm here.

1397

- Take me.
- [growls]

1398

[Anderson] Go on. beast.

1399
01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:07.583
Kill us both. Confirm your maker's tale.

1404
01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:26.666

01:42:43.541 --> 01:42:44.541
Answer me.

1601
01:42:45.916 --> 01:42:46.916
Tell me.

1602
01:42:47.416 --> 01:42:48.916
Why are you here?

1603
01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:52.375
[creature] Travel.

1604
01:42:52.875 --> 01:42:54.583
Welcome. dear traveler.

1605
01:42:55.125 --> 01:43:01.392
Do not think me ungrateful for the company
if I ask you to procure a chair.

1606
01:43:01.416 --> 01:43:06.226
I... I find it difficult
being a good host.

1607
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:07.142
Yes.

1608
01:43:07.166 --> 01:43:10.833
My... My sight has failed me.

1609
01:43:11.791 --> 01:43:16.642
[chuckles] But there is bread
and brandy on the table.

1610
01:43:16.666 --> 01:43:17.875
Pray help yourself.

1611
01:43:20.083 --> 01:43:21.541
[creature] Bran... dy?

1612
01:43:22.875 --> 01:43:24.333
Your language.

1613
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.333
You have a hard time speaking it.

1614
01:43:28.916 --> 01:43:31.000
Are you not from these parts?

1615
01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:34.958
- [bottle shatters]
- [creature gasping]

1616
01:43:36.791 --> 01:43:37.791
Are you afraid?

1617
01:43:39.625 --> 01:43:40.875
No need to be.

1618
01:43:45.875 --> 01:43:47.500
What are you afraid of?

1619
01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:50.208
- [creature] Everything.
- [blind man] Your...

1620
01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:53.250
Your hands are frozen

1621
01:43:53.791 --> 01:43:57.434
and you've been hurt. have you not?

1622
01:43:57.458 --> 01:43:58.517
[creature] Hurt?

1623
01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:05.392
Yes. Your hands and face have scars

1624
01:44:05.416 --> 01:44:06.934
and you are wearing uniform.

1625
01:44:06.958 --> 01:44:08.875
Were you injured in battle?

1626
01:44:12.125 --> 01:44:13.208
You were hiding

1627
01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:16.476
in the mill gears. were you not?

1628
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.267
[creature grunts sheepishly]

1629
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:19.726
[blind man] Ah!

1630
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:20.976
[both chuckle]

1631
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.226
Yeah. Yeah. The Spirit of the Forest.

1632
01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:25.934
- [creature] Yes.
- [chuckles]

1633
01:44:25.958 --> 01:44:28.500
I cannot judge of your countenance.

1634
01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:31.642
but there is something in your voice

1635
01:44:31.666 --> 01:44:35.625
which persuades me
of your goodwill and kindness.

1636
01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:38.041
- Kindness?
- Mm.

1637
01:44:39.625 --> 01:44:41.708
Stay with me.

1638
01:44:43.041 --> 01:44:45.625
Share my food and fire.

1639
01:44:46.125 --> 01:44:49.976
I would be delighted
to share what little I have with you

1640
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.666
and would be greatly helped
by your companionship.

1641
01:44:54.333 --> 01:44:57.458
And you... you could read to me.

1642
01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.375
- Read?
- Mm.

1643
01:45:00.125 --> 01:45:05.875
Make this your home and I your friend.

1644
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.791
Friend.

1645
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:14.958
Friend.

1646
01:45:18.625 --> 01:45:19.791
[grunting softly]

1647
01:45:21.708 --> 01:45:22.708
[chuckles softly]

1648
01:45:23.333 --> 01:45:24.541
Friends.

1649
01:45:25.583 --> 01:45:29.625
[creature] <i>And it was then
that I read my first story.</i>

1650
01:45:30.625 --> 01:45:33.166
<i>and it was the first story.</i>

1651
01:45:34.375 --> 01:45:39.333
<i>I read about a man named Adam
and a woman named Eve.</i>

1652
01:45:40.208 --> 01:45:43.583
<i>about their time in the first garden.</i>

1653
01:45:44.458 --> 01:45:47.666
<i>I read about the rise of rival cities</i>

1654
01:45:48.166 --> 01:45:49.916
<i>and the collapse of a tower</i>

1655
01:45:50.416 --> 01:45:52.726
<i>and the wrath of a God.</i>

1656
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:57.726
<i>And I read about men
that fought dragons</i>

1657
01:45:57.750 --> 01:46:00.500
<i>and men who lost everything.</i>

1658
01:46:01.375 --> 01:46:03.041
<i>And time passed</i>

1659
01:46:03.625 --> 01:46:06.875
<i>and fell away with the leaves of autumn.</i>

1660
01:46:10.666 --> 01:46:13.125
[tender classical music playing]

1661
01:46:18.541 --> 01:46:21.666
Have you never seen the snow.
my dear friend?

1662
01:46:23.333 --> 01:46:27.083
It makes the world clean... and new.

1663
01:46:28.583 --> 01:46:30.375
[creature gasping in awe]

1664
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.833
[creature] <i>"My name
is Ozymandias. King of Kings."</i>

1665
01:46:38.333 --> 01:46:41.666
<i>"Look on my works.

1666
01:46:42.958 --> 01:46:45.208
<i>"No thing beside remains."</i>

1667
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:50.059

1670
01:47:05.208 --> 01:47:07.517
Are there more books

01:47:07.541 --> 01:47:08.875
[blind man laughs]

1672
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:11.625
A few more. I'm sure.

1673
01:47:12.375 --> 01:47:13.791
Not here.

1674
01:47:15.833 --> 01:47:19.226
Last book on the left. Take it.

1675
01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:21.351
We haven't got to it.

1676
01:47:21.375 --> 01:47:24.184
<i>Paradise Lost.</i> Milton.

1677
01:47:24.208 --> 01:47:27.208
Man has questions for God.

1678
01:47:27.958 --> 01:47:30.333
Even God has questions.

1679
01:47:31.041 --> 01:47:35.750
I think he wanted answers
and that is why he sent us his son.

1680
01:47:36.333 --> 01:47:38.791
Death probably intrigued him.

1681
01:47:39.416 --> 01:47:40.416
Suffering.

1682
01:47:41.458 --> 01:47:44.416
I want to know who I am.

1683
01:47:45.166 --> 01:47:46.916
Where do I come from?

1684
01:47:47.458 --> 01:47:52.750
God took your memory just as I wish
he would take mine away.

1685
01:47:54.208 --> 01:47:57.500
Many years ago. I took a man's life.

1686
01:47:58.166 --> 01:47:59.166
A good man.

1687
01:47:59.625 --> 01:48:02.041
And I have been atoning for it since.

1688
01:48:04.333 --> 01:48:05.333
Forgive.

1689
01:48:06.125 --> 01:48:07.125
Forget.

1690
01:48:07.666 --> 01:48:09.583
The true measure of wisdom.

1691
01:48:10.791 --> 01:48:12.892
To know you have been harmed.

1692
01:48:12.916 --> 01:48:15.142
by whom you have been harmed.

1693
01:48:15.166 --> 01:48:18.125
and choose to let it all fade.

1694
01:48:19.208 --> 01:48:23.142
But I cannot forget
what I cannot remember.

1695
01:48:23.166 --> 01:48:24.666
Do you recall nothing?

I remember f... fire and water.

1704

And sand under my feet.

1705
01:49:15.333 --> 01:49:16.583
And a word.

1706
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:20.750
A single word.

1707
01:49:23.208 --> 01:49:24.500
What is it?

1708
01:49:27.291 --> 01:49:28.291
Victor.

[blind man] <i>Go to it.</i>

<i>The horror of the truth.</i>

1715
01:50:20.708 --> 01:50:23.875
<i>I understood that I was nothing.</i>

1716
01:50:25.166 --> 01:50:26.375
<i>A wretch.</i>

1717
01:50:27.083 --> 01:50:28.375
<i>A blot.</i>

1718
01:50:28.916 --> 01:50:32.041

1719
01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:37.041

01:55:56.333 --> 01:56:01.434
<i>and then... merciless life.</i>

1782
01:56:01.458 --> 01:56:03.059
[wheezing]

1783
01:56:03.083 --> 01:56:05.500
- [melancholy music playing]
- [gagging]

1784
01:56:10.041 --> 01:56:11.416
[groaning]

1785
01:56:16.875 --> 01:56:18.791
<i>How long did I die for?</i>

1786
01:56:19.375 --> 01:56:20.666
<i>I do not know.</i>

1787
01:56:21.375 --> 01:56:23.666
<i>But I saw my injuries healed.</i>

1788
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:28.375
<i>The cold winter air stung in my lungs.</i>

1789
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:39.625
<i>I felt lonelier than ever.</i>

1790
01:56:40.625 --> 01:56:45.458
<i>because for every man
there was but one remedy to all pain:</i>

1791
01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:51.166
<i>Death. a gift you too had denied me.</i>

1792
01:56:52.041 --> 01:56:54.166
<i>Envy rose within me</i>

1793
01:56:55.083 --> 01:56:58.083
and decided to demand
a single grace from you.

1794
01:56:59.333 --> 01:57:01.041
My creator.

1795
01:57:02.375 --> 01:57:06.833
I would demand... a companion.

1796
01:57:09.833 --> 01:57:11.166
[fire crackling]

1797
01:57:20.541 --> 01:57:21.541
[Victor gasps]

1798
01:57:25.333 --> 01:57:26.767
[eerie inhuman screech]

1799
01:57:26.791 --> 01:57:28.083
[gasping]

1800
01:57:32.625 --> 01:57:33.434
[knock on door]

1801
01:57:33.458 --> 01:57:35.125
[William] I need you to get up.

1802
01:57:36.291 --> 01:57:37.809
[Victor] Yes. of course. Of course.

1803
01:57:37.833 --> 01:57:40.708
[William] The wedding will start soon
and I want you by my side.

1804
01:57:41.416 --> 01:57:42.708
It's hard to believe.

1805
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:45.750
if not for your kind nature.

1806
01:57:48.791 --> 01:57:49.791
[groans]

1807
01:58:00.833 --> 01:58:03.208
I've spoken to a few guests
about the inquest.

1808
01:58:04.125 --> 01:58:05.208
About the explosion.

1809
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.166
The majority accept it for what it was.

1810
01:58:11.458 --> 01:58:13.458
And what was it. William?

1811
01:58:14.875 --> 01:58:15.958
The past. Victor.

1812
01:58:17.625 --> 01:58:19.333
A terrible accident.

1813
01:58:26.291 --> 01:58:28.083
I intend to sell the estate.

1814
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.541
All we have is each other.

1815
01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:37.208
[Victor chuckles]

1816
01:58:39.416 --> 01:58:41.416
[joyful classical music playing]

1817
01:58:44.583 --> 01:58:46.458
[creature breathing heavily]

1818
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:51.142
I want you to throw the petals everywhere.

1819
01:58:51.166 --> 01:58:52.666
Throw them everywhere.

1820
01:58:53.666 --> 01:58:54.666
Mm.

1821
01:58:55.208 --> 01:58:57.083
Go upstairs and do some more of that.

1822
01:59:06.375 --> 01:59:09.833
[Victor] I know it is bad luck
to see the bride before the ceremony.

1823
01:59:10.458 --> 01:59:11.750
[Elizabeth] Only for the groom.

1824
01:59:13.416 --> 01:59:15.000
[Victor] Yes. that's right. Not for me.

1825
01:59:17.166 --> 01:59:18.375
Hello. Elizabeth.

1826
01:59:20.083 --> 01:59:21.184
[sighs in hesitation]

1827
01:59:21.208 --> 01:59:24.791
I've rarely felt remorse
before and now I feel little else. I...

1828
01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:29.642
A fever gripped me for so long.
but it has passed.

1829
01:59:29.666 --> 01:59:31.750
and I see you now as I should.

1830
01:59:33.458 --> 01:59:37.601
For whatever it's worth.
I... I wish you and my little brother.

1831
01:59:37.625 --> 01:59:40.416
who I love more than life. the very best.

1832
01:59:43.166 --> 01:59:45.125
You may like to believe you do.

1833
01:59:49.166 --> 01:59:51.041
And I dread to even hear it.

1834
01:59:55.208 --> 01:59:57.916
On my wedding day.
I ask you but for a single grace.

1835
01:59:59.166 --> 02:00:00.375
No more lies.

1836
02:00:01.791 --> 02:00:03.976
- I-- I want to tell you--
- Leave my chambers now.

1837
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.875
- Elizabeth.
- Leave!

1838
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:24.958
[grunting in anger]

1839
02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:29.517
[huffs sharply]

1840
02:00:29.541 --> 02:00:31.625
[wind howling softly]

1841
02:00:35.875 --> 02:00:38.000
[dramatic ominous music playing]

1842
02:00:50.041 --> 02:00:51.500
[breathing heavily]

1843
02:00:54.541 --> 02:00:56.541
[ominous music continues]

1844
02:00:58.458 --> 02:00:59.976
[nervous breath]

1845
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.875
Come out of the shadows.

1846
02:01:03.166 --> 02:01:04.458
if you are here.

1847
02:01:14.625 --> 02:01:15.833
[Victor gasps sharply]

1848
02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.208
[breathing shakily]

1849
02:01:21.916 --> 02:01:23.166
Are you here to thank me?

1850
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:27.291
You survived and are intelligent enough
to have found me.

1851
02:01:29.291 --> 02:01:30.684
I made you well.

1852
02:01:30.708 --> 02:01:37.458
I need you to make a companion for me.

1853
02:01:38.166 --> 02:01:40.184
One like me.

1854
02:01:40.208 --> 02:01:42.416
A com... A companion?

1855
02:01:46.125 --> 02:01:47.125
Oh.

1856
02:01:48.041 --> 02:01:49.041
I see.

1857
02:01:53.333 --> 02:01:54.666
Another monster.

1858
02:01:55.333 --> 02:01:56.333
Yes.

1859
02:01:57.208 --> 02:01:59.375
We can be monsters together.

1860
02:02:02.583 --> 02:02:07.017
I have found sanity at such a cost.

1861
02:02:07.041 --> 02:02:11.476
and you here...
are madness calling me back.

1862
02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:13.625
I cannot die.

1863
02:02:17.250 --> 02:02:19.291
And I cannot live...

1864
02:02:21.916 --> 02:02:22.916
alone.

1865
02:02:24.166 --> 02:02:26.708
In you I have created
something truly horrible.

1866
02:02:28.083 --> 02:02:29.958
Not something.

1867
02:02:30.875 --> 02:02:32.666
Someone.

1868
02:02:33.666 --> 02:02:36.833
You made someone.

1869
02:02:37.625 --> 02:02:38.625
Me.

1870
02:02:39.458 --> 02:02:42.250
Whatever puzzle I am. creator. I think.

1871
02:02:43.166 --> 02:02:44.416
I feel.

1872
02:02:45.875 --> 02:02:47.583
I have this sole petition...

1873
02:02:48.458 --> 02:02:52.541
Make one like me.

1874
02:02:54.291 --> 02:02:55.416
And then what?

1875
02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.208
Procreation.

1876
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.625
Reproduction.

1877
02:03:02.583 --> 02:03:03.708
Mm...

1878
02:03:06.458 --> 02:03:07.625
A home?

1879
02:03:08.541 --> 02:03:09.958
A grave?

1880
02:03:11.541 --> 02:03:15.226
Death begetting death begetting death.

1881
02:03:15.250 --> 02:03:17.559
A race of devils
propagated upon the earth.

1882
02:03:17.583 --> 02:03:19.625
Obscenity perpetuating itself.

1883
02:03:20.416 --> 02:03:23.892
I am obscene to you.
but to myself I simply am.

1884
02:03:23.916 --> 02:03:25.166
Begone!

1885
02:03:25.875 --> 02:03:26.875
[grunts]

1886
02:03:27.625 --> 02:03:33.833
Never again will I make
something like you. wicked and deformed.

1887
02:03:38.291 --> 02:03:44.333
Then it is still
all about your will. Victor.

1888
02:03:45.083 --> 02:03:46.083
Hmm?

1889
02:03:47.083 --> 02:03:52.416
That horrible. horrible will
that birthed me condemns me now?

1890
02:03:53.708 --> 02:03:58.309
The miracle is not that I should speak.
but that you would ever listen!

1891
02:03:58.333 --> 02:03:59.875
[Victor yells]

1892
02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:01.976
[muffled crashing]

1893
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.309
If you are not to award me love.
then I will indulge in rage.

1894
02:04:07.333 --> 02:04:08.934
And mine is infinite.

1895
02:04:08.958 --> 02:04:10.166
[Victor grunts]

1896
02:04:12.208 --> 02:04:14.000
- [loud clattering]
- [guests exclaim]

1897
02:04:15.208 --> 02:04:16.476
Step aside.

1898
02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:17.500
Victor.

1899
02:04:18.875 --> 02:04:19.916
What's going on?

1900
02:04:21.375 --> 02:04:22.708
[Elizabeth gasping]

1901
02:04:24.458 --> 02:04:26.458
[gentle piano music playing]

1902
02:04:34.125 --> 02:04:35.875
[Elizabeth sobbing softly]

1903
02:04:38.666 --> 02:04:39.708
[Elizabeth] You...

1904
02:04:44.625 --> 02:04:45.625
You...

1905
02:04:46.666 --> 02:04:47.958
It's you.

1906
02:04:51.208 --> 02:04:52.291
[Elizabeth sobs]

1907
02:04:52.875 --> 02:04:55.000
Elizabeth. move away from it!

1908
02:04:55.708 --> 02:04:56.601
No!

1909
02:04:56.625 --> 02:04:57.791
[Elizabeth gasps]

1910
02:05:04.125 --> 02:05:05.851
[Elizabeth gasps in pain]

1911
02:05:05.875 --> 02:05:07.791
[guests clamoring]

1912
02:05:10.666 --> 02:05:13.476
[Victor] It attacked her! It attacked her!

1913
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.291
[all grunting]

1914
02:05:17.416 --> 02:05:18.541
[sharp thud]

1915
02:05:20.833 --> 02:05:22.250
[breathing heavily]

1916
02:05:33.291 --> 02:05:34.809
[Elizabeth] Take me with you.

1917
02:05:34.833 --> 02:05:37.291
[sorrowful classical music playing]

1918
02:05:44.833 --> 02:05:47.250
[guests gasp. exclaim in fear]

1919
02:05:48.833 --> 02:05:50.583
- [woman] Oh. my God!
- [women scream]

1920
02:06:00.041 --> 02:06:02.458
[sorrowful classical music continues]

1921
02:06:10.541 --> 02:06:11.541
[Victor grunts]

1922
02:06:16.208 --> 02:06:18.476
- No. let me... I can save you.
- [groans]

1923
02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:19.666
I can save you.

1924
02:06:20.333 --> 02:06:21.333
From what?

1925
02:06:22.416 --> 02:06:23.541
From you?

1926
02:06:25.333 --> 02:06:26.684
I fear you. Victor.

1927
02:06:26.708 --> 02:06:27.892
No. no...

1928
02:06:27.916 --> 02:06:29.291
I always have.

1929
02:06:29.958 --> 02:06:32.416
Every ounce of madness and destruction.

1930
02:06:33.583 --> 02:06:37.166
The very conflagration
that devoured everything.

1931
02:06:39.083 --> 02:06:40.458
It all came from you.

1932
02:06:43.666 --> 02:06:44.791
[sobs]

1933
02:06:46.458 --> 02:06:48.291
You are the monster.

1934
02:06:55.791 --> 02:06:56.934
[Victor sobs]

1935
02:06:56.958 --> 02:06:57.958

[mournful classical music playing]

1939
02:07:17.375 --> 02:07:18.375
[Elizabeth sniffles]

1940
02:07:21.041 --> 02:07:23.250
[Elizabeth] My place
was never in this world.

1941
02:07:25.125 --> 02:07:29.458
I sought and longed for something
I could not quite name.

1942
02:07:31.583 --> 02:07:33.458
But in you. I found it.

1943
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:39.208
To be lost and to be found.

1944
02:07:40.208 --> 02:07:42.184
that is the lifespan of love.

1945
02:07:42.208 --> 02:07:44.101
[Elizabeth sobs]

1946
02:07:44.125 --> 02:07:45.625
And in its brevity.

1947
02:07:46.875 --> 02:07:48.125
its tragedy...

1948
02:07:49.083 --> 02:07:50.541
[choking up]

1949
02:07:52.208 --> 02:07:53.875
this has been made eternal.

1950
02:07:57.833 --> 02:08:00.875
Better this way... to fade...

1951
02:08:01.625 --> 02:08:03.184
[sniffles]

1952
02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:05.166
with your eyes gazing upon me.

1953
02:08:07.666 --> 02:08:08.666
[Elizabeth exhales]

1954
02:08:10.916 --> 02:08:12.726
[creature whimpering softly]

1955
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:15.166

[breathing heavily]

1958
02:08:48.208 --> 02:08:51.291
She is gone and I long to follow.

1959
02:08:52.958 --> 02:08:54.250
[both grunting]

1960
02:08:56.125 --> 02:08:58.250
You gave me life unwanted.

1961
02:08:59.583 --> 02:09:01.416
