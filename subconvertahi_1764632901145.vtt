﻿1
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.566
Check it out. folks! A photo
of us from my wedding.

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.856
Is that Nicky caccimelio?

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.316
The missing mobster was at your
wedding? The whole town is looking for him.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.656
And he's talking with Lester.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.156
And handing him an envelope.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.286
What if Nicky killed Lester?

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.826
Lester's building ledger?

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.286
Mrs. Coluca. please. I...
He'd want you to have it.

9
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.166
Besides. I think you might find
some very interesting tidbits in here.

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.086
You know I cared about you. pal.

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.926
Anyone here? Just
dropping off a chapeau!

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.886
This doesn't prove
anything. What is he doing?

13
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.330
I know this closet.

14
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.210
Whoa. mama!

15
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.276
That's the envelope that Nicky
gave Lester at the wedding.

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.470
Lester was here the night he
died. This was no tragic accident.

18
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.056
What do I do? I don't know what I do.

19
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.186
Shovel the snow. put salt down.

20
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.856
Carpeted mats in the elevators.

21
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.710
You don't want nobody
slipping. Believe me.

22
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.576
So. what is this again?

23
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.076
A study on New York City doormen.

24
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.076
Is the public clamoring for that?

25
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.336
You know. it's not brain
surgery. but I do help people.

26
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.706
You know. I chat with them.

27
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.770
Give them a pick-me-up if
they need that. you know?

28
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.336
Keep candy for the kids
being raised by nannies.

29
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.820
Take their dogs out for
their morning constitutional.

30
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.266
I helped a lady give birth right
here in this lobby 14 years ago.

31
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.306
Yankees shoulda signed me the
way I fielded that slippery sucker.

32
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.236
Everything these days
gettin' so disconnected.

33
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.566
That's what we look after. you know?

34
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.276
The one-on-one thing.

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.760
Lose that in this city? Shit.

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.350
People pass on in here too. of course.

37
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.496
You open a door for them the first time.

38
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.246
Might open it for the last. too.

39
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.480
So... respect.

40
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.256
Been at this desk 32 years now.

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.926
Crazy to say out loud.

42
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.636
I never planned on being a doorman.

43
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.886
I was gonna be an actor.

44
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.306
A movie star. to be specific.

45
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.936
I was a little de-lu-lu back then.

46
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.800
But I can remember that
first day like it was last week.

47
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.486
Okay. Lester.

48
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.826
Work starts at 6 A.M.

49
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.810
That means in uniform.
not walking through the door.

50
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.456
You never let a tenant see
you in your civilian clothes.

51
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.270
Hey. when do we get paid?
And there are tips. right?

52
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.336
Around the holidays.

53
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.676
I was kinda hoping to
be acting full time by then.

54
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.006
Speaking of. who do I talk
to about time off for auditions?

55
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.716
You're not leaving for auditions.

56
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.226
You got a life. you got
dreams. good for you.

57
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.476
But when you're here.
you're about the tenants.

58
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.056
That's the gig.

59
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.646
And if you do it right. who knows?

60
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.646
You might fall in love with the place.

61
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.130
Got it?

62
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.340
Come on. Let's go.

63
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.696
We are old New York.

64
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.560
Whatever that means.

65
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.996
Thirty-two years?

66
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.616
You must have quite a story.

67
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.376
- You mind sharing it?
- My story?

68
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.356
Look who it is.

69
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.776
You're starting with a tough one.

70
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.946
She always leaves
early to buy a lotto ticket.

71
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.906
She'll ask you what numbers to play.

72
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.140
Don't engage.

73
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.980
- Good morning. Ms. Folger.
- Good morning. George!

74
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.926
New guy.

75
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.410
I hope you're better than that last moron.

76
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.136
- When's your birthday?
- Me?

77
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.516
May 18th. 1948?

78
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.420
Five. 18. 19. 48.

79
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.010
That's not bad.

80
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.930
After you. Ms. Folger.

81
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.680
If I win. I'm not sharing.

82
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.706
Always. "after you."
Makes the tenants feel good.

83
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.666
And pay attention.

84
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.086
The real trick is noticing the little things.

85
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.530
Like. did you see her coat?

86
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.296
No.

87
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.136
Because she wasn't wearing one.

88
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.926
But it's cold out. Means
she's having a hot flash.

89
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.766
When she comes home
later. she's gonna ask you

90
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.596
to turn the radiator off in her apartment.

91
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.710
Here.

92
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.186
That thing is part of your arm now.

93
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.696
The safety of everyone in this
building is right there in your hands

94
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.236
with that elevator crank.

95
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.196
You listening?

96
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.496
Pay attention to the small stuff.

97
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.560
That way. you know what's coming.

98
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.746
Good evening. Mr. Dimas. Missus...

99
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.376
- Not Mrs. Dimas.
- Not Mrs. Dimas.

100
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.110
Not Mrs. Dimas.

101
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.596
We're visiting my sister in 12e.

102
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.936
Welcome. And who is this?

103
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.856
This is Mabel. She's
gonna meet her auntie.

104
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.106
Hi. Mabel.

105
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.606
Welcome to the arconia.

106
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.486
Let me get the elevator
for you. Mrs. Mora.

107
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.466
My neck! My back!

108
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.306
Sir. you didn't fall.

109
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.136
I saw you lay yourself on the ground.

110
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.766
Don't you try to trick me just because
I've had a terrible brain trauma.

111
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.356
Everyone saw!

112
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.226
Whoa! We're the only ones here.

113
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.476
What are you trying to pull?

114
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.050
Unrelated...

115
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.366
I made an offer on a unit here.

116
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.576
but it's a. competitive situation.

117
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.746
Although. if someone on the inside.

118
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.876
a hero who. could make the
other applications disappear.

119
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.586
maybe I wouldn't sue.

120
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.280
So. that's what you're after.

121
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.660
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

122
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.870
That's very kind of you...

123
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.580
- Lester.
- Yeah.

124
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.516
It's... it's... it's nice to meet you.

125
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.250
It's nice to meet you. too.

126
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.226
Excuse me. can I help you?

127
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.526
Are you visiting someone.
or... My god! Brazzos!

128
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.486
I'm your biggest fan.
Could we get a photo?

129
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.350
I'm sorry. I don't do photos
without my brazzos badge.

130
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.430
Wait.

131
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.376
This sends your life into
a whole new direction.

132
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.086
Here we go.

133
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.626
And you keep the badge.

134
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.006
Thank you!

135
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.216
Wow. Mr. Savage. you
handled that like a pro.

136
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.216
You know. I'm an actor.
too. Still just getting started.

137
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.756
but boy. I'd love a career like yours.

138
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.676
Well. good luck to you. my friend.

139
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.806
Network TV is a fickle lady.

140
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.766
And I'm here to say.
she can be seduced.

141
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.106
Man. it's so cool we get to
have that guy living here. right?

142
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.106
Okay. Mr. Stars in your eyes.
apparently. some homeless woman

143
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.946
is causing a racket in the courtyard.

144
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.340
Go ask her to move it along.

145
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.676
- Yeah...
- S-Sorry. I know. I'll leave.

146
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.700
No. no. please. Your...
your voice is beautiful.

147
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.136
Well. taking them for a walk

148
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.136
is the only way to get
them down for a nap.

149
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.766
That and a lullaby. so...

150
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.566
And I love the acoustics in this building.

151
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.550
It's... well. it's... actually.
it's the limestone. so...

152
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.026
I'm Lester.

153
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.566
- I'm...
- Florence?

154
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.300
You sound like a nightingale.

155
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.810
It's my favorite songbird.

156
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.366
I'm Lorraine. but most
people call me rainey.

157
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.536
Rainey.

158
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.496
So. when I'm rich and famous.

159
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.296
and you're an opera star...

160
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.256
we'll still eat our lunch together here.

161
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.796
but. up in our own apartment.

162
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.256
How's that sound?

163
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.676
Terrible. Absolutely awful.

164
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.146
Hey. whoa. whoa.

165
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.186
- I love you. Mrs. Coluca.
- I love you. Mr. Coluca.

166
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.116
It's gorgeous!

167
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.286
Look at the Christmas village. mother.

168
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.576
To spend the holidays
with a daughter-in-law.

169
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.456
or grandkids.

170
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.826
- I'm working on it.
- Well. hurry up!

171
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.416
You gotta find a nice girl before
this y2k thing ends the world.

172
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.126
Being with a girl would
be the end of the world.

173
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.216
- What did you just say?
- Nothing. mother. Song lyrics.

174
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.370
What the hell are you doing?
You shouldn't be in here!

175
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.196
Hey. I'm Lester.

176
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.390
Who are you?

177
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.826
I'm Mabel.

178
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.680
You got bigger.

179
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.376
Were you playing
hide-and-seek in George's closet?

180
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.586
No. You need friends for that.

181
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.246
I was just hiding.

182
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.466
I could use a friend.

183
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.386
There's one last ornament
that I gotta put on this tree.

184
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.950
Think you could help me out with that?

185
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.046
- After you. and after you.
- Thank you.

186
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.886
Say cheese!

187
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.136
Okay. now a normal... a normal one.

188
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.216
Alright. okay. okay.

189
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.056
Lester. they're making
faces. They're making faces.

190
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.096
D-Don't answer. Lester. Don't answer.

191
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.686
Seriously. guys. just... just one.

192
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.226
- For the Christmas card.
- Okay. alright. Okay.

193
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.436
Oliver! You got a second?

194
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.436
- For you. Teddy. anytime.
- D...

195
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.736
- our reservations are at 6:30!
- I-I'll just be a minute. I promise.

196
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.276
We don't have a puppet budget.

197
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.100
Maybe two. Seven. tops.

198
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.246
Just because it works for lion king.

199
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.996
doesn't mean our show needs puppets.

200
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.706
We're doing a musical
about the shroud of turin.

201
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.916
We're on thin ice as it is.

202
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.466
My agent sent me some script. gladiator.

203
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.756
It's between me and
this guy. Russell Crowe.

204
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.976
- You like your chances?
- Well. he's not gonna get it.

205
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.936
Listen to this. "Are you not entertained?"

206
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.646
Whoa! So good.

207
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.896
I always wanted to do chariot work.

208
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.396
Hey!

209
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.896
Hey. just the actor I was looking for.

210
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.446
Here's a little gift for the holidays.

211
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.970
And. this will keep it
fresh 'til you get it framed.

212
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.770
You're an actor?

213
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.296
An official ledger. Wow.

214
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.806
A little something extra for the kids.
Should buy a lot of toys. Georgie?

215
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.396
- Family appreciates it.
- Okay.

216
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.100
- Merry Christmas. boss!
- Merry Christmas.

217
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.986
Whoa. George.

218
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.856
Are you holding out on me?

219
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.066
I've seen you get
those envelopes before.

220
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.616
- I want in.
- Why?

221
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.156
You don't need the money.

222
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.616
Aren't you leaving any
day now to go be a big star?

223
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.496
That's a low blow.
George. It's Christmas.

224
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.100
Merry Christmas. Lester.

225
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.966
Hold on. hold on. wait.

226
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.596
Yeah.

227
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.936
- You got it?
- Yep.

228
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.646
Wait. just keep that with the others.

229
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.726
Got this?

230
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.146
Never thought I'd live to
see the day the arconia

231
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.446
has an automated elevator.

232
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.696
I hate to see the elevator
go. but I love to watch it leave.

233
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.076
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. mother.

234
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.036
Just from a technology
advancement standpoint.

235
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.996
Things are only getting worse.

236
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.286
I remember when a
beer cost you a dollar.

237
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:04.190
you could smoke on planes.
and pimps still dressed like pimps.

238
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.190
Here you go.

239
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.150
Lester. A word.

240
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.726
George. George. I... I
know. with the new elevator

241
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.556
you might not need a second
doorman. but I can't lose this job.

242
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.606
I've got kids now. rainey's
finally getting traction

243
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.566
with her career. but... but
it's opera. It doesn't pay shit.

244
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.310
- I mean. I'm... I'm happy here.
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!

245
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.760
There's someone I
wanna introduce you to.

246
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.986
- Come on. This way.
- Wha...

247
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.826
After you.

248
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.676
Lester. this is Nicky caccimelio.

249
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.046
Whoa. you gonna hit me with that?

250
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.136
What?

251
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.306
No! I'm sorry.

252
00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.950
I'd never. I know better.

253
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.846
I grew up across from
your family's dry cleaners.

254
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.460
No shit? You're from flat bush?

255
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.920
What do an Italian girl in tight
jeans and Brooklyn got in common?

256
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.566
- Flatbush?
- Flatbush! That's it.

257
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.550
Alright.

258
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.076
Maybe.

259
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.746
- What's going on?
- I'm retiring.

260
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.876
Which means we're gonna
need someone new on the desk

261
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.956
and someone new to
help with Mr. Caccimelio.

262
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.626
I know you need the money.

263
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.490
And I know you love the building.

264
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.926
Consider this your big break.

265
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.346
Wait. are you serious?

266
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.226
Wait. What... what do I have to do?

267
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.306
- It's not like I need to...
- whoa. whoa. whoa. take it easy.

268
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.766
Nothin' like that. okay?

269
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.186
N-Not all the work is legal
per se. but nobody's gettin' hurt.

270
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.526
I got a place here in the arconia.

271
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.356
A little business on Saturday night.

272
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.446
All you need to do is stay a little later.

273
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.220
let a few people in.
keep the night flowing.

274
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.366
Capisce? Discreetly. of course.

275
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.166
That doesn't seem bad.

276
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.376
I mean. I'm... I'm already
good at letting people in.

277
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.456
Right. That's right.

278
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.126
Easy money.

279
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.920
Welcome to the family.

280
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.260
Well. that's it.

281
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.446
Just be careful.

282
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.406
Let the people in. but
keep your head down.

283
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.906
The less you know. the better.

284
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.706
Okay. yeah. Got it.

285
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.730
You know...

286
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.836
I wasn't so sure about
you when you started.

287
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.610
But you've really proven yourself.

288
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.386
Take care of my building. Lester.

289
00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.620
It's yours now.

290
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.450
After you.

291
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.906
- Good morning. Lester.
- Morning. Ms. Folger.

292
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.036
You forget to shave
on your official first day?

293
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.496
I'm just trying something out.

294
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.956
I'll make sure your radiator's
off when you get home.

295
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.730
Well. thank you. You're
right on top of things.

296
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.586
Door!

297
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.506
After you.

298
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.926
Sorry about gladiator. Mr. Savage.

299
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.086
Not a problem.

300
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.596
I'm auditioning for national
treasure. Third callback.

301
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.806
It's between me and nic
cage. but he's not gonna get it.

302
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.450
- Not right.
- Because you're a national treasure.

303
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.580
Hey.

304
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.566
There he is. there he is.

305
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.896
Lester the Jester.

306
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.816
Hey. I like nicknames.

307
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.760
- We'll work on it. Good work.
- Thank you. boss.

308
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.966
Mrs. Morris.. Thank you. Lester.

309
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.506
My son is a g.

310
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.756
Do you know about lgbt?

311
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.806
- He's the g.
- Okay. mother.

312
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.660
And any other g would be
lucky to have you. Howard.

313
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.146
- You just need to find one.
- And have grandkids.

314
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.606
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Lester.

315
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.630
He could bring 'em to that proud parade.

316
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.310
Here to see Nicky? Right this way.

317
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.386
Lester!

318
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.926
- Lester!
- Lester!

319
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.016
There's a creep outside
preying on beautiful women.

320
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.620
We had to run for our lives.

321
00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.346
I can't believe you still got that thing.

322
00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.210
Lester and his crank.

323
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.646
Piece of arconia history. As
long as I'm here. it'll be. too.

324
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.076
Just like this.

325
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.746
- Where?
- Like. in a box.

326
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.746
You kids better not get too crazy tonight.

327
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.246
I don't wanna have to come up there.

328
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.126
The wine is for cooking.

329
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.786
Sure. a nice boxed wine reduction.

330
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.006
How many guests are we
expecting at this. formal dinner party?

331
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.006
Just althea. Tim. and a
few friends from bay port.

332
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.716
Maybe don't say "bay port" if
you want to put Lester at ease.

333
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.306
Hey. no hating on b-port. rich boy.

334
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.676
Lester. if a few other people
come with "cooking supplies"...

335
00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.556
they're with us.

336
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.936
Sorry if it's a lot of people.

337
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.106
Don't worry.

338
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.726
I remember when you
didn't have any friends.

339
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.686
And look at you now.

340
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.130
Look at me now. Look
at you now. Mabel.

341
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.076
It's my anniversary.

342
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.826
No shit. Congrats. I love love.

343
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.246
Me. too.

344
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.246
Thing is. I... I promised my wife
we could go out to dinner tonight.

345
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.336
Ladies love a dinner.

346
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.626
Right. but it's Saturday.

347
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.796
Exactly. so I-I thought maybe
I could take the night off.

348
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.676
No. no. no. No can do. Lester.

349
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.926
I need you there.

350
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.846
But you know what ladies also love?

351
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.936
Sunday brunch.

352
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.066
You know. maybe it's time I finish up.

353
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.316
My kids are in college
now. I've been saving.

354
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.316
I really don't need extra money anymore.

355
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.906
That's not really how it works. Lester.

356
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.246
You go when it's convenient for you.

357
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.616
Remind me who put
your kids through college?

358
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.246
I'm the reason you have anything.

359
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.796
So. you are gonna stay behind that desk

360
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.256
until I say you're done.

361
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.740
Happy anniversary.

362
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.080
- Sure.
- Okay.

363
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.170
Front desk.

364
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.946
Mr. Putnam?

365
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.826
Lester. can you run me a bath?

366
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.616
And then check to see if
Roberta took the toaster.

367
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.996
We're gonna need that.

368
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.706
No. that's the one thing
I'm not allowed to help with.

369
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.770
It's really frowned on.

370
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.296
If I died right now.

371
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.990
do you think I'd make it
onto the Tony "in memoriam"?

372
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.660
Answer carefully. I'm...

373
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.080
I'm very fragile.

374
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.710
Yes. she... she took all the vases.

375
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.356
God. Lester.

376
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.066
I'm gonna die alone.

377
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.800
In this apartment I
fought so hard to keep.

378
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.066
- Vase-less.
- Come on.

379
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.776
You got plenty of time
to turn things around.

380
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.696
You hear about Harrison Ford?

381
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.286
What?

382
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.890
Another plane crash?

383
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.876
See. that's how you get
on the "in memoriam."

384
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.706
I don't know about that.

385
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.166
I just know it took him
a while to figure it out.

386
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.666
You're a late bloomer. Mr. Putnam.

387
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.046
Just like me.

388
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.410
A couple of kids with
our whole life ahead of us.

389
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.620
You know...

390
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.056
If you leave these on the table.
they're just gonna wither away.

391
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.380
But if you care for 'em...

392
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.960
Put 'em in water...

393
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.880
Give 'em some sun.
they'll bounce right back.

394
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.946
You're very wise. Lester.

395
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.650
You know. I'm glad you're here.

396
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.046
Don't worry.

397
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.610
I just found out today
I'm not going anywhere.

398
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.080
After you.

399
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.596
After you.

400
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.250
After you.

401
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.576
Isn't it nice to have all these people
walk past you without noticing?

402
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.656
Yeah. welcome to life as
a postmenopausal woman.

403
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.480
Have a good day. girls.

404
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.070
It's okay.

405
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.580
- You're gonna be okay.
- Thanks. Lester.

406
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.540
Alright. Lester.

407
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.146
Another big night?

408
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.010
Now. listen. it's a little
heavier tonight. okay?

409
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.946
- Buy something shiny for the missus.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.106
- Alright?
- Yeah. yeah. sure.

411
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.576
You know wives. they're like
ravens. They go crazy for that stuff.

412
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.866
- Yeah. Yeah. thanks.
- Alright.

413
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.536
You. give me your address and
I'll send you a check for it! Geez.

414
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.206
Hey! Hey! You okay. Mr. Savage?

415
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.996
- Yeah.
- You're short! You need to pay!

416
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.626
We came in from Atlantic city.

417
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.006
- He says I owe him a hundred and a half.
- It's 400!

418
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.966
Four hundred?! What'd we do?
Go by way of the Brooklyn bridge?

419
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.256
Aw.

420
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.136
Here. Here. here.

421
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.306
Thanks. Lester.

422
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.596
I had a bad night. It happens.

423
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.136
No judgment. Mr. Savage.

424
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.436
You'll bounce back soon. You're brazzos.

425
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.186
No. Lester. I used to be brazzos.

426
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.356
Eight to 10 million people used to
tune in every Thursday night to watch me.

427
00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:00.026
I had an anatomically correct
McDonald's happy meal action figure.

428
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.576
I had two girlfriends at the same time.

429
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.270
And that was before it was cool.

430
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.036
And those auditions I go on?

431
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.916
They're not auditions. Lester.

432
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.206
They're... they're courtesy calls.

433
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.296
Here. here. Here's a deck
of cards from the nugget.

434
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.836
You keep 'em. I don't want 'em.

435
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.716
You know. you just
need one thing to go right.

436
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.006
and. you'll bounce back.

437
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.886
Hey. you know Harrison Ford?

438
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.976
Don't mention Harrison Ford to me.

439
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.306
He beat me out for secret life of pets 2.

440
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.186
Well. he was a late bloomer.

441
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.790
Maybe you are. too.

442
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.210
It's getting pretty late. Lester.

443
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.816
Let's keep safe. everybody!

444
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.946
Let's keep safe!

445
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.736
Let's go. let's go! We
don't know if it's a fire...

446
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.406
is this really necessary. Lester?

447
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.576
It took four people to get
winnie down ten flights of stairs.

448
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.206
Not sure what to tell you.
Mr. Putnam. We're figuring it out.

449
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.036
Most folks are headed to
librizzi's. if you wanna join.

450
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.456
It's hard to get a table there. but okay.

451
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.126
Okay. come on. keep moving. please.

452
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.876
Please keep moving. Come on.

453
00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.756
Come on. a little hustle. a little hustle.

454
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.796
Welcome to only murders in the building.

455
00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.926
a true crime podcast.

456
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.676
I'm your host. Charles-haden savage.

457
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.346
A murder.

458
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.146
The killer must've
walked right past my desk.

459
00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.476
No. it's not your fault!

460
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.726
One murder in 30 years?

461
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.470
Four?

462
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.180
Honey. I'm not gonna lie to you.

463
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.166
Four is a lot of murders.

464
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.626
I know. Might be time I get some help.

465
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.730
Yeah. yeah.

466
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.650
Okay. Randall.

467
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.676
Today is gonna be a big day of training.

468
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.216
You're starting on a crazy week. though.

469
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.700
- We have a wedding.
- A wedding?

470
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.686
Do you know if they're
having a dj or a band?

471
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.606
'Cause I... I gig.

472
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.750
Upright bass. It's what I play.

473
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.896
It's actually my plan in life.

474
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.986
Not this doorman... stuff.

475
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.470
No offense.

476
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.666
You're not just opening doors for tenants.

477
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.166
You're sending them into the world
or you're welcoming them back home.

478
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.900
Your job is to not miss one
detail. no matter how small.

479
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.320
Years of notes in here.

480
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.740
- What's that?
- It's nothing.

481
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.846
But if a man comes in
with a white gardenia.

482
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.266
you don't talk to him. Only me. okay?

483
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.396
- You don't wanna get involved. Got it?
- Okay.

484
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.606
- You're gonna love being married.
- You see it all. working here.

485
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.776
You're here for their highest
highs and their lowest lows.

486
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.276
And if you're lucky like me.

487
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.550
you'll blink and fall in love with the place.

488
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.286
These buildings?

489
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.496
They could've switched to
automatic doors years ago.

490
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.270
But they kept the
doorman. Always a doorman.

491
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.990
But I think doing this job. you
become part of a shared story.

492
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.266
The story of the building.
and all of the people inside.

493
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
There's something important
about the simple role we play.

494
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.260
It's hard to put into words. but I
think you'd feel it if we were gone.

495
00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.590
It's just so bizarre.

496
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.366
I can't believe he's gone.

497
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.746
Guys. the police report just came in.

498
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.116
Accidental death?

499
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.036
I mean. the guy fills a fountain with blood

500
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.916
in the most murderous
building in New York.

501
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.166
and they say it's accidental?

502
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.756
So. we just assumed murder?

503
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.336
Well. believe it or not. Mabel.
most old men do drop dead.

504
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.296
We youngins should be prepared

505
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.016
for Charles to do the
same in the next two to four.

506
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.516
Excuse me? My doctor says

507
00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.766
I have the resting
heart rate of a dairy cow.

508
00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.806
See. a bovine has. four
stomachs. but one heart.

509
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.816
and stress can actually regulate.

510
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.550
Or we could just kill him now.

511
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.566
It feels weird.

512
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:13.446
I mean. I guess someone
could just die in our building.

513
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.456
So. what. there's no story here?

514
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.116
It's alright.

515
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.956
There is no story.

516
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.530
I'm the guy who held the door.

517
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.136
For us doormen. it's never about us.

518
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.806
You know what I used
to say over and over?

519
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.870
What was it he used to say
when he'd opened the door for us?

520
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.856
After you. After you.

521
