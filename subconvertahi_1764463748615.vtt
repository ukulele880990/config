00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.180
Today. I'm going to teach
you how to make a hamburger.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.780
Drink this. too.

4
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.570
Do you have a place to go?

5
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:54.980
You know how to wash
the dishes. right?

6
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.440
I can't work for a while anyway.

7
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.940
I can't give you money.

8
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.000
Instead. I'll give
you a hamburger.

9
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.420
How have you been?

10
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.840
Hey. pizza.

11
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.940
Where have you been?

12
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.260
You've been away for a week.

13
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.500
It's not even a day or two.

14
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.740
Why are you asking
me all of a sudden?

15
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.700
I just got a call.

16
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.640
Listen to me.

17
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.540
Honey. I'm sorry.

18
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.560
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.100
Hey. Jerry.

20
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.140
Where have you been?

21
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.380
You know. you girls were very
lonely when you were gone.

22
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.900
Don't worry about that.

23
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I'll take care of it.

24
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.740
Hello. sweetie.

25
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.660
What are you doing?

26
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
What?

27
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.620
It's okay.

28
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.300
It's okay.

29
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760
No. it's okay.

30
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.190
Hang in there.

31
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.540
Are you doing this for me?

32
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.960
Do you really want to kill me?

33
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.970
You're fucking dead.

34
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.880
Please save me.

35
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040
Don't kill me.

36
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.620
Please let me stay here.

37
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.240
It's okay.

38
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.460
I killed my grandmother.

39
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.560
I'll call your name.

40
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.730
What are you doing?

41
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.230
I'm going to cry.

42
00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.270
I'm going to cry.

43
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.470
You're a bastard.

44
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.970
I'm going to hit
you in the head.

45
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.410
I'm pregnant.

46
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.346
I'm taking care of
my pregnant wife.

47
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.189
How long have you
been on your stomach?

48
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.830
Otherwise. I'm going
to eat chicken feet.

49
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.610
I'm sorry.

50
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.030
What's wrong with you?

51
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.330
Why are you doing this to me?

52
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.049
Why are you doing this to me?

53
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.130
What are you talking about?

54
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.530
Are you crazy?

55
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.430
You don't even let me marry you.

56
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.750
You don't even let me grow up.

57
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.030
You keep calling me when
you have a boyfriend.

58
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.650
You only say hello when
you're comfortable.

59
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.570
What?

60
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.930
I'm going to the hospital.

61
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.130
I'm on my way.

62
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.810
You have to get out
of this station.

63
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.530
I'm going to the hospital.

64
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.530
Hey. are you out of your mind?

65
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.010
It's the subway.

66
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.210
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

67
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.330
I'm sorry. sir.

68
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:01.650
I'm sorry. sir.

69
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.490
It's not me. it's not me.

70
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.470
It's okay. it's okay.

71
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.710
I heard you're going
to do it for my son.

72
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.589
I'm sorry. sir.

73
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.890
I'm sorry. sir.

74
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.526
You're the one who's going
to be in charge of this.

75
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.230
I'll talk to you in detail.

76
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.410
I'm not in a good
mood about the subway.

77
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.570
The first-time is great.

78
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.550
I bought it because
of the script.

79
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.250
Why don't you take it?

80
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.310
Flowers bloom and water
is just twice a year.

81
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:24.950
You have to say good
things are good.

82
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.070
Let's raise a person who
can grow more plants.

83
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.046
I'm so nervous that I'm going
to die because I'm a poop hand.

84
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.070
Let's go today.

85
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.570
Listen to me.

86
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:41.370
You're always looking at the red one. but you're looking
at the green one. and you're looking at the other three.

87
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.330
It's too much if you
don't know women.

88
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.570
And why do you take care of
your grandmother like that?

89
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.190
You don't even look at her.

90
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.210
How do you know?

91
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.720
It's been a long time.

92
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.560
That's right.

93
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.720
Stop wearing that.

94
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.360
This is real.

95
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.660
You're here.

96
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.100
Hello.

97
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.480
It's been a long time.

98
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.820
Do you want to talk to me?

99
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.880
It's not a disease.

100
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.960
Isn't it just a
government office?

101
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:19.680
No.

102
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.760
30 years ago The establishment
that destroyed dealers' souls.

103
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.780
It's better to have
a bowel movement.

104
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.740
What is it?

105
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.160
It's like a pile of pain.

106
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.720
Did you take something
from your client?

107
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.600
No matter how much you
refuse. What should I do?

108
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:48.040
How can we maintain our fairy
business without funding?

109
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.199
What if your parents say...

110
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.700
Hyungnim. flies are
pests. aren't they?

111
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.040
What?

112
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.600
They eat up all the food and
carry around dirty bottles.

113
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.740
The flies.

114
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.336
They've been carrying them around since they were charged. and they've been
blowing away the pollen. and they've been maintaining the ecosystem we live in.

115
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.420
They're pests. pests.

116
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.320
What's wrong with being fat?

117
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.020
They become food for us.

118
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.920
You just have to wear a ring.

119
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.880
You don't have to be surprised.

120
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500
Hyungnim.

121
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.240
Hyungnim.

122
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.515
I'm done with my work.

123
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.890
Oh. you've done a difficult job.

124
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.890
It's easy to rescue a wounded
kid by putting blood on my hands.

125
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.690
But this kid is so old that
the shelter won't accept him.

126
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.790
It's not going to work out.

127
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.210
There's a high possibility that
he'll be euthanized in the end.

128
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.870
So you can call and
ask for help yourself.

129
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.210
What?

130
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.010
If the rescue team contacts you
directly. they can't refuse.

131
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.449
Do you usually do
this kind of thing?

132
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.450
Don't you think it's too cruel to be
abandoned because you're old and sick?

133
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.070
You can be abandoned
once. right?

134
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.210
It's okay.

135
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.430
You'll meet a good person.

136
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.490
Brother?

137
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:54.530
Wait a minute.

138
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.989
It's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

139
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.990
Stay still.

140
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:59.410
Cheer up.

141
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.910
Cheer up.

142
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.430
Cheer up.

143
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.120
By the way. does
this hurt a lot?

144
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.799
No. come to think of it. I heard
that he was stabbed with a knife.

145
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
It doesn't hurt at all.

146
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.200
It doesn't hurt at all.

147
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.100
I'll sew it up nicely.
so don't worry too much.

148
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.140
Help me.

149
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.900
Help me.

150
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.360
Help me.

151
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.280
Oh. my God.

152
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.320
Oh. my God.

153
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.540
There's nothing to be afraid of.

155
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.640
It's okay. it's okay.

156
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.620
Are you willing
to sell a cornea?

157
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.080
All of a sudden?

158
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.240
Excuse me.

159
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.696
It's a little embarrassing.

160
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.480
The client keeps asking
me to take this off.

161
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.380
How much is one?

162
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680
5.000 won for beans.

163
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.300
I'll give you three more.

164
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.200
3.000 won?

165
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240
Yeah.

166
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.819
3.000 won is a little...

167
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.820
Why?

168
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.660
Look. mister.

169
00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.260
What do you want me
to do with 3.000 won?

170
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.359
The glasses cost a lot. but why
is it the same as 10 years ago?

171
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.859
Okay. then I'll...

172
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.760
I'll give you a big one.

173
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.820
10 10?

174
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040
10 seconds.

175
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.860
Not even your neck.

176
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.910
What's wrong with you?

177
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.410
What's wrong with you?

178
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.870
You pulled your eye
out a while ago.

179
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.550
Huh?

180
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.730
Someone else's guest.

181
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.770
Did you send it to Dr. Kim?

182
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.370
Why did you do that
to your best friend?

183
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.110
I'm going to see you soon.

184
00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.010
Make up at home.

185
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.650
Dr. Kim is dead.

186
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.530
No. but there must be a
purpose for doing this.

187
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.950
Purpose?

188
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.130
It's famous.

189
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.550
I think this is where
the nerves are gathered.

190
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.410
You don't know what
I'm going to do.

191
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.250
There's no way I know.

192
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.420
Slowly Painfully

193
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.130
You're in.

194
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.330
In other people's business.

195
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.230
Wow. you're tough.

196
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.150
Did you put your hands in?

197
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.610
Mr. Han of Banpo.
Mr. Yoon of Dongtan.

198
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.310
And today. Mr. Gu.

199
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.270
Your hands are still sharp.

200
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.410
Isn't it a waste not to
use it on the street?

201
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.030
Are you a self-made fan?

202
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.630
Goodbye.

203
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.630
Huh?

204
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.990
Wait a minute.

205
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.510
Wait a minute.

206
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.870
Let's talk.

207
00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.130
Let's settle on this.

208
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.830
It's all expensive.

209
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.350
Are you okay?

210
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:45.639
I was too excited that
I went back to sleep.

211
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:45.740
I think I haven't slept
like this for a long time.

212
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:48.959
It was so cold that I
couldn't get out of the house.

213
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.960
Get out of the way.

214
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.020
I can't do this.

215
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.099
If I can't kill
Hanseong. My son...

216
00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.660
My son...

217
00:19:26.005 --> 00:19:27.005
Did you order?

218
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.370
If it's not too late.
let's eat together.

219
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:40.840
Aren't you tired?

220
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.320
It's over when you open it.

221
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.620
It's a dumpling.

222
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.480
When are you going
to do this again?

223
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.000
Did you clean up the back?

224
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.460
You don't doubt the
CCTV or the witness?

225
00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060
No.

226
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.960
That's what the client is like.

227
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.980
Leave it quiet.

228
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.716
Why are you talking
about people?

229
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.020
I told you to stay in your room.

230
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.220
Don't worry.

231
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.640
Before I hear the chicken
feet. I'm leaving on my own.

232
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.340
You're sensitive.

233
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.080
This is the woman
at the entrance.

234
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.580
No. it's not.

235
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.120
I only introduced
you to Hong Yeo-seo.

236
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.539
My son's girlfriend is...

237
00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.039
I was attacked by the weak.

238
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.480
He died of addiction shock.

239
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.060
I went to my son's room.

240
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.060
I got lynched.

241
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320
Is it a plant?

242
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.700
It's worth it.

243
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.740
In many ways. Manager
Son rejected it.

244
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280
All right?

245
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.060
And I made a reservation for
a health checkup last year.

246
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.760
I'm going to follow
the procedure now.

247
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.900
He's got a brown belly.

248
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.240
Like you're asking
me to recognize me.

249
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.680
I've been around the target.

250
00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.420
I'm going to eat it when
I'm going to eat it.

251
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.220
Just before I go crazy.

252
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.480
I'm working on it in
the most painful way.

253
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.060
So my nickname is Two.

254
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.840
I don't know.

255
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.320
I don't know what it is.

256
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.780
In a word. it doesn't
mean anything.

257
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.100
Not a murder without emotion.

258
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.100
Let's use the good
skills we have.

259
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.360
Disinfection.

260
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.640
Are you telling
me to catch a bug?

261
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.100
That's right.

262
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.740
They're like wheels in our way.

263
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.400
It's our job to get rid of them.

264
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.120
It's our job to save
those who are suffering.

265
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.460
Oh. my God.

266
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.440
Is it a gift of salvation?

267
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.879
I can't just go.

268
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880
I have to go.

269
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.600
I don't have any drugs.

270
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.480
You're a good joker.

271
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.380
First of all. I know
he's too serious.

272
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.460
He didn't know.
so he was kidding.

273
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.799
Just take a look at him.

274
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.960
I'll cover you up.

275
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.220
There's a lot of
protein in the brain.

276
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.660
Are you nervous these days?

277
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.160
No. I'm fine.

278
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.260
If you look at the color here.
The signal is a little bad.

279
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640
Don't tell the company.

280
00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.380
That's a big problem.

281
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.180
Then today could
be the last day.

282
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.210
What's the next direction?

283
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.610
You can't overdo it.

284
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.169
When was it?

285
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.170
It's too much.

286
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.910
You're a joker.

287
00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.510
Where are you hiding it?

288
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.870
Why are you so loud?

289
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.370
What company?

290
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:43.170
Why did this fall out?

291
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.490
Who is it?

292
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.040
The old people would have done
everything you told them to do.

293
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440
Why did you kill him?

294
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.639
That's Park Gyeok-bok's knife.

295
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640
Sir!

296
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:00.980
Boss!

297
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.820
It's all done by the police.

298
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.360
I'd rather have a
police officer eat it.

299
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.900
Let's go.

300
00:24:51.177 --> 00:24:52.254
Dad.

301
00:24:52.454 --> 00:24:53.454
No.

302
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:01.472
Move!

303
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.000
I'll be there.

304
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.100
Why are you doing this?

305
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.500
What's wrong with you?

306
00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:57.029
You're going to be my age.

307
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.679
A woman in her 40s was
found dead in a car.

308
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:09.020
According to the witness. a man who was presumed to be a suspect
stayed around the victim's car for a while before the accident.

309
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:18.180
The suspect parked his car on the side of the road and left the victim. who was
unconscious. alone. After that. the suspect followed the witness and came close

310
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.720
to the earth and then ran away.

311
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.639
The police assumed this case to be a
murder case disguised as a suicide.

312
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.540
After the autopsy. the suspect was
identified as a man in his mid-50s.

313
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.340
Hello.

314
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.620
Come as soon as you can.

315
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.580
I'm the one who moves
in the first unit.

316
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.600
Didn't you do pre-education?

317
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.120
You're not as good as I thought.

318
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.400
Oh. my God.

319
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:19.980
You've dedicated your
life to the party.

320
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.140
You're so dishonorable.

321
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.180
You don't feel comfortable
with me. do you?

322
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.980
But a car is turning over.

323
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.060
The principle is the principle.

324
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.840
I'll stick it on.

325
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840
I'll do it.

326
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.159
Because of you?

327
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.160
I'm sorry.

328
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.210
If you do that.
I'll be grateful.

329
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.450
But how are you
going to find it?

330
00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.090
Then it's obvious where to go.

331
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.090
Anyway. you're a lot of work.

332
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.690
Would it be okay?

333
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.390
The weight of time.

334
00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.910
Are you here?

335
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.810
How was it?

336
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:08.970
Are you okay?

337
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.190
I've done a lot of work.

338
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.370
Didn't you wait for me?

339
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.870
What is it?

340
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.760
I told you to report the group.

341
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.270
You brought all your fingers.

342
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.030
Check if you're out of breath.

343
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.050
Chief.

344
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.950
Can I talk to you for a second?

345
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.210
You're here?

346
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.470
It's an honor.

347
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.450
Why did you do that?

348
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.350
It's when Eun-ho was born.

349
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.810
Eun-ho died 10 years ago.

350
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.170
You mean Eun-ho didn't
meet the pastor?

351
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.550
The world wouldn't
have been so angry.

352
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.430
Then my life would
have changed. right?

353
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.870
There's a way.

354
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.310
What's so great about dying?

355
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.160
What's so great about dying?

356
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.170
I'm going to show you
how to play the game.

357
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.310
I think I can't kill you.

358
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.490
Can't you kill me?

359
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:49.180
I'm sorry. but I told
you to quit this time.

360
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540
I'm going to kill you.

361
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.240
I'm going to kill you.

362
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240
I told you to live there.

363
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.000
So die.

364
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.200
I thought I was
going to die at home.

365
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.180
What is it?

366
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.300
Who are you?

367
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.820
You've seen us before.

368
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.560
Get out of the way.

369
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.760
This is my job.

370
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080
It's my job. too.

371
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.760
Did you do that to your husband?

372
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.180
As best as you can?

373
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.520
If you did your job right. I wouldn't
have to come forward like this.

374
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800
I heard you're a legend.

375
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.920
I have a bad head. I have
wrinkles. And I'm already this old.

376
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160
You're dead.

377
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.460
You're as good as my mom.

378
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.920
I'll have to do it myself.

379
00:33:44.921 --> 00:33:46.001
I'll take care of the rest.

380
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.580
It's your job.

381
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.100
When it's time to go. The
person you missed will come out.

382
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.020
My daughter...

383
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.740
I'm done now.

384
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.720
I've done enough to hurt you.

385
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.620
Did you come out?

386
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.750
I'm sorry.

387
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.020
I won't take it again.

388
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.500
Let's just go.

389
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.700
No. I'm done with work.

390
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.120
What if something happens?

391
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.000
I can't get in touch
with my house right now.

392
00:36:24.344 --> 00:36:26.010
I told you not to
leave me alone.

393
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:31.490
Whether the other person is smiling or not. You're going
to end up like this because you're sniffing at others.

394
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.990
Keep in mind.

395
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.170
Don't shoot a
butterfly with a gun.

396
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.460
Let's go now.

397
00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:20.730
Don't move.

398
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:25.850
What are you doing?

399
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.470
I'm sure you've seen it.

400
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.070
What is it?

401
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.290
You've seen it well.

402
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.780
You can't do this.

403
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.220
Hang in there.

404
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:35.390
What about today's work?

405
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.880
It's all up to me.

406
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.410
Thank you.

407
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:50.950
I'm going to work.

408
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:51.950
Hang in there.

409
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.650
I'll give you some medicine.

410
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.740
You're a little late.

411
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.460
Put your back down.

412
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:48.690
Why?

413
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:50.890
What did I believe in?

414
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.490
The waves are high.

415
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.550
If you're going to use
it. you're in trouble.

416
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.490
It's a precious asset
to the Holy King.

417
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:15.330
This knife looks a little dull.

418
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:27.570
But I think I can still use it.

419
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:36.110
Looking at your face. I think you're picking
up anyone on the street and making them work.

420
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.630
Our job is to
replace the bad bugs.

421
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.550
It's a sacred thing.

422
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.610
For example. take ordinary kids.

423
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.326
I'm going to build
a construction site.

424
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:46.790
I'm going to defend the weak.

425
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:49.690
The things you refuse.

426
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.530
That's our job.

427
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.230
You're so frustrating.

428
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.550
Dogs?

429
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.150
They're the mafias
of the country.

430
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:01.070
If you touch it
wrong. you'll die.

431
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:02.250
It's like a poison pocket.

432
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.370
I don't know how to do it.

433
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.110
It's a comfortable job.

434
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.110
It's my right.

435
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.230
The right is to
take responsibility.

436
00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:11.990
Then why don't you
try it yourself?

437
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.790
There's nothing I can't do.

438
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.630
And two dogs.

439
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:23.910
He's a clean friend.

440
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:24.930
He's good.

441
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.510
Now. as a colleague. Let's
have a meal together.

442
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.390
Your father was so young.

443
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.630
When you were snoring.

444
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.110
At that time. you
were in your prime.

445
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.160
Let's go play somewhere.

446
00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.440
Don't you want to
grow your nails?

447
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.380
What?

448
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.899
You used to paint your back.

449
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.300
Tell me to paint this and that.

450
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.900
Why?

451
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.040
Do you want me to rip your face?

452
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.200
You must have something to do.

453
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.540
You're lying down like a dog.

454
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.900
You've been treated.

455
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.320
You left a witness there.

456
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.020
If the company finds out.
You're going to be in trouble.

457
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.840
Now I know who you are.

458
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.230
Do you know?

459
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.590
I know.

460
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:50.990
I'm going to die.

461
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:03.950
Even if you go to the river. If you go out of your eyes.
If you go there. There are a lot of other businessmen.

462
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.990
So don't stand in front of me.

463
00:44:07.991 --> 00:44:11.824
If you want to live a long time.

464
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.600
I'll take care of it.

465
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.519
I'll take care of it.

466
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:38.020
If it's not money or justice.
What's the purpose of coming here?

467
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.160
It's a legend.

468
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.780
You're here.

469
00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.140
You have good eyes.

470
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.180
I went to make more
snacks in the afternoon.

471
00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.339
I've made a lot of snacks.
so I'm very satisfied.

472
00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.839
Everyone has a good time
while reading the book.

473
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.040
I was watching a drama as
soon as I got home from work.

474
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.540
I was reading a book while
eating a lot of sweet potatoes.

475
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:29.610
Hello.

476
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.250
Oh. yes.

477
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.460
Welcome.

478
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.740
This is a new peach flavor.

479
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.020
This is honey flavor.

480
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.100
I'll take that.

481
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.600
How many do you want?

482
00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.680
Four?

483
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.420
That's a lot.

484
00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.160
If you eat this. you'll
get four in no time.

485
00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.420
You're seven years old.

486
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.219
You're good. right?

487
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.220
Yes.

488
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240
Where's your mother?

489
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.060
Yes. she's in heaven.

490
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.200
How did she die?

491
00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.980
She had another surgery.

492
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.160
She was in the hospital for
five years. and then she died.

493
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.260
After that. my son-in-law
couldn't sleep at night.

494
00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.619
That's why he's always
out here and there.

495
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.719
He's been doing that for years.

496
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.960
He's been doing that for years.

497
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.660
That's a lot of work
for a dead person.

498
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.780
That's a lot of work
for a dead person.

499
00:49:32.781 --> 00:49:34.181
I'm the one who's
talking about it.

500
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.280
I'll give you another one.

501
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.180
I'm not going to buy
it. but it's better.

502
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.420
I'll eat well.

503
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.700
Come again.

504
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.269
Come again.

505
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.530
Yes.

506
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.730
Hye-ri.

507
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.230
Dad!

508
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.150
Why are you so late?

509
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:02.470
Did you eat?

510
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:03.850
Yes.

511
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.030
I missed you.

512
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:06.370
Hye-ri. wait a minute.

513
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:11.850
Hye-ri.

514
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.850
Sir.

515
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560
Sir.

516
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:20.910
Why are you here?

517
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.880
My family doesn't care.

518
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:25.590
Why?

519
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.020
Yes.

520
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.680
You must have seen
what I was carrying.

521
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.080
You're a good person.

522
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.400
You saved a broken child.

523
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.880
I'm not a good person.

524
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.020
That's the only answer
a good person can give.

525
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.550
How's Woo-young?

526
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.210
Woo-young?

527
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.750
I think he's a brave kid.

528
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:57.110
I'm not looking.

529
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:59.149
What about Jang Myung-hee?

530
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:00.870
You're not good at it.

531
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.670
Why don't you go
to the hospital?

532
00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.050
I'm afraid I'll get
fired from the company.

533
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.470
You're a scary woman.

534
00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:11.970
I'm afraid I'll get fired.

535
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.470
Then you have to let me
know if you get hurt.

536
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.930
Woo-young goes out
for a walk often.

537
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:28.130
I don't know what to call you.

538
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:30.450
What's your name?

539
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.000
Do you think I'm a good person?

540
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.680
Woo-young.

541
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.600
All right.

542
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.340
From today. your
name is Woo-young.

543
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.200
There are already more than
40 years on this golden land.

544
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.720
How good would it be to release
it all and open it up again?

545
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.880
It's not as easy as I thought.

546
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.160
Since I was a kid. I've been
in front of a herbivore.

547
00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.780
An old lion is holding
on to the wheel.

548
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.080
I think I lost all my toenails.

549
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.860
You've never made a
mistake while hunting?

550
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.660
It was perfect.

551
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.040
It's unbelievable.

552
00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.420
It's a legend that I'm
passionate about and afraid of.

553
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.060
Those humans can't
afford to do that.

554
00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.380
What the hell happened?

555
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.560
There was an original man named Yu who built
the bottom of this place for the first time.

556
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.419
It's not too late
to be 49 years old.

557
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.900
It's not too late
to be 49 years old.

558
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.760
What should I do with my family?

559
00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:35.450
He said he'd take revenge on the day of his death. and
he sterilized 28 people with a single shot of blood.

560
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.940
Our great mother.

561
00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:51.380
Change my name to a
piece on my fingernail.

562
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.780
What the hell is that?

563
00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.940
It's the first time
I've ever seen Yu Hyuk.

564
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.640
Hello. Grandma.

565
00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.290
You're out for a
walk with Wooyoung.

566
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:29.650
Can I play with you?

567
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.040
Wooyoung. let's go.

568
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:36.920
Hye-ni. don't go too far.

569
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.920
Hye-ni. don't go too far.

570
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.680
You look like a smart kid.

571
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:47.650
You look a lot like your mom.

572
00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.650
Did you hear that
from my mother-in-law?

573
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:05.790
The hospital director told me that everyone who
tries to save one's life first makes a real mistake.

574
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:07.170
I don't know what to do.

575
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.750
I just bit my tongue.

576
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.570
Or I just want to kill you.

577
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.776
Would you like to
have a meal together?

578
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.180
We were on our way to lunch.

579
00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.700
No. I'm here.

580
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.600
Let's go together.

581
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.360
It's all about
eating and living.

582
00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:45.680
I'm sorry.

583
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240
I'm just going.

584
00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.960
Please. let's go together.

585
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.580
I'm going to go next week.

586
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.840
Grandma. are you coming. too?

587
00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.500
What should I do?

588
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.180
I can't go to places like this.

589
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.540
No. I worked really hard.

590
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.900
Hye-ni. what's wrong with you?

591
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.120
I don't care.

592
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.860
What is it?

593
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:17.570
Chogak Chogak?

594
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:23.550
My name Chogak?

595
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:24.410
Chogak?

596
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:25.050
Chogak?

597
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:25.710
Chogak?

598
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:30.260
It means animal claws.

599
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.580
I didn't know that.

600
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.140
Look here.

601
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.880
You can't do that
without permission.

602
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.140
Look at this.

603
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.380
It's a dog. right?

604
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.800
Give me your number.

605
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.040
I'll send it to you.

606
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:48.159
Hye-ni I'm sorry.

607
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.160
It's coming.

608
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.240
Dad. what should I do?

609
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.340
I think someone broke
it and ran away.

610
00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.760
Uh. hello.

611
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.200
How did you get here?

612
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.180
There's an old hunter.

613
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.460
There's one.

614
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.060
He's doing something
he doesn't usually do.

615
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.320
Why is that?

616
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.900
What?

617
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:40.339
I'm afraid of small things.

618
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.340
It's shaking.

619
00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:44.480
I'm getting scared.

620
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920
I'm sweating.

621
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.780
I think you came
to the wrong place.

622
00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.740
This is a hospital.

623
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.540
People are also animals.

624
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.540
No?

625
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.080
No. I can't cure
people with medicine.

626
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.620
That's weird.

627
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.280
I think people are also animals.

628
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760
Hello.

629
01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.300
Oh. Mr. Ggangcheong.

630
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.580
I'm not good at this.

631
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.180
That's too bad.

632
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.360
Let's go inside.

633
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.330
I'm sorry.

634
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:43.970
Strawberries!

635
01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:45.190
I want to eat strawberries!

636
01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:46.690
You can't eat strawberries!

637
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:51.010
What are you going to do?

638
01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.250
This California
orange is sweeter.

639
01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.550
How can this be sweeter?

640
01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.010
Uncle. this is it.

641
01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:58.490
It's my presentation next week.

642
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:59.230
Come on.

643
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:00.070
What should I do?

644
01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:01.550
I'm a little busy.

645
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:02.730
No.

646
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:04.910
I've been working
hard since yesterday.

647
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:07.190
Yeah?

648
01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:08.290
Shall we take a look?

649
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.710
Oh. you're good.

650
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.070
I have a good wish.

651
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.530
What are you doing?

652
01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:27.510
No. it's been a long time.
so it's wrinkled and bruised.

653
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:29.130
It tastes the same.

654
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:30.810
People don't know.

655
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:32.650
It's pretty and fresh.

656
01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:42.690
Mr. Kang If you touch
a hair. You're serious.

657
01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:49.210
You're a good cook.

658
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:50.410
You're a good cook.

659
01:01:50.411 --> 01:01:51.910
You melt all the
ice-like humans.

660
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:57.010
I'll leave. so stop.

661
01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440
What?

662
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:01.951
If I'm not here. there's no
threat to the sacred defense.

663
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:05.230
The innocent man will be safe.

664
01:02:09.169 --> 01:02:10.169
I don't want to.

665
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.990
How can you have such a dream
because of that one person?

666
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:20.770
As you get older. you get a
lot of germs in your skin.

667
01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:24.610
Do you want to protect
the people around you?

668
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:31.009
What's your purpose
for coming in here?

669
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:39.010
You don't know where

670
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:46.040
you're going. but you don't
know where others are going.

671
01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.430
Do you know where
your friend is going?

672
01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.160
What's important?

673
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.720
You have the freedom to look
at it as much as you want.

674
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.679
You don't have the
right to do that.

675
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680
Are you okay?

676
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160
Look at this.

677
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.400
Who gives you the same
money and buys it?

678
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.730
Go in and rest.

679
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:20.630
It's okay.

680
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.020
I'll give you my ID
card and a ticket.

681
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.700
I don't need it.

682
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.520
I'll stay where I want to be.

683
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.420
I don't need it.

684
01:04:34.421 --> 01:04:35.920
Do whatever you want.

685
01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.219
But now. you and I...

686
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.500
Let's not make things
we have to protect.

687
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:16.980
It's already been 10 years.

688
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.960
You did a great job.

689
01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:24.410
Keep your dignity with that.

690
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.840
What are you?

691
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.005
Are you happy?

692
01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:53.220
I don't know.

693
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.440
The client's conditions are
confidential. so I can't tell you.

694
01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.760
Why do you leave a
good-talking guy?

695
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.640
Oh...

696
01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:07.201
I'm asking you because
you're a victim.

697
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.300
I'm asking you because
you're a victim.

698
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.139
It's better for you to clean up.

699
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.420
It's better for you to clean up.

700
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:42.420
Who are you?

701
01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.700
Why are you doing this to me?

702
01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.840
Why are you targeting
Kang Bong-hae?

703
01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:02.200
It's a rule made by
your mother-in-law.

704
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.300
I'm not trying to catch fish.

705
01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.420
I'm trying to catch the sea.

706
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.990
I don't even know where
the ship is going.

707
01:08:24.190 --> 01:08:26.190
Kang Bong-hae killed
my mother-in-law.

708
01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:27.890
So I'm going to get revenge.

709
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:29.850
He gave me a lot of money.

710
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.870
Kang Bong-hae can't be
that kind of person.

711
01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.090
It's weird.

712
01:08:35.409 --> 01:08:37.329
He said he was the son
of the hospital director.

713
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.890
Manager Son said he'd just
take it because it was money.

714
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.250
Just in case.

715
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:48.510
I did a background check.

716
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:50.670
It's a lie!

717
01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:51.810
It's a lie!

718
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:58.130
Are you going to do it or not?

719
01:08:58.890 --> 01:08:59.970
It's a lie!

720
01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:02.990
You son of a bitch!

721
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:13.590
Why did you ask me to
kill Kang Bong-hae?

722
01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:16.830
Who are you?

723
01:09:16.831 --> 01:09:20.930
I really don't know.

724
01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:21.830
I really don't know.

725
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.990
I need to get some money.

726
01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:24.490
To whom?

727
01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:27.570
I'll call you on the phone.

728
01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.450
I have a cell phone
in my back pocket.

729
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:31.950
Call me.

730
01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:37.930
Why?

731
01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:40.929
There's a woman...

732
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:41.350
Why?

733
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.289
I don't think it's time to
be playing with Jjukjeong.

734
01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:47.150
What do you want?

735
01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.170
Equal destruction.

736
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.630
It's time for
Mr. Kang to go home.

737
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.870
I'll help you this time.

738
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:28.670
Wait a minute.

739
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:30.990
Thank you.

740
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.280
I'm sorry.

741
01:12:04.684 --> 01:12:07.879
Don't leave me alone.

742
01:12:15.295 --> 01:12:16.295
I'm sorry.

743
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:28.060
How did you know this place?

744
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.960
That's a relief.

745
01:12:42.415 --> 01:12:44.878
You don't have to
worry about me.

746
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.280
Excuse me.

747
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:02.710
Don't you have
anything to say to me?

748
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840
It's a little late.

749
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.220
Make sure you eat.

750
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:26.010
How do you feel?

751
01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:31.430
Why are you looking
at me so complicated?

752
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:33.910
It's useless.

753
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.250
If you don't think
about it yourself.

754
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:38.790
I'm going to deal with it now.

755
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:40.910
Why are you doing
this in front of me?

756
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:42.750
Yeah.

757
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.850
Why?

758
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:46.650
I just want to see
the legendary ending.

759
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.200
You must be disappointed.

760
01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.540
I was disappointed.

761
01:13:54.460 --> 01:14:00.639
To me I've been looking for my whole
life to find something like this.

762
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640
Stop it.

763
01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.240
If that's me. you've
already found it.

764
01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.460
No.

765
01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.120
I haven't found it yet.

766
01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.740
It's not a real victory.

767
01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.740
Retreat?

768
01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.580
Don't even dream.

769
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.540
And you can never beat me.

770
01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.980
You have something to protect.

771
01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.440
I don't have anything to lose.

772
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.800
Welcome.

773
01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:38.090
Wait a minute.

774
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.540
Son.

775
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.440
I'm going to work from today.

776
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:40.880
Hi.

777
01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:01.980
Give me some water.

778
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.320
When is your dad coming in?

779
01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:13.820
It's past 12 o'clock.

780
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:32.580
How long has it been?

781
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.140
Ten days.

782
01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.520
Aren't you tired?

783
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.140
I'm tired.

784
01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.140
Oh. my God.

785
01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220
I'm sorry.

786
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:45.820
I'll clean it up.

787
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:14.770
You're after my back.

788
01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.520
Listen carefully.

789
01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:37.800
If I don't come in.
you're going over there.

790
01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:40.120
Stupid.

791
01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.920
Don't starve to death.

792
01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.759
Find a new owner.

793
01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.600
I don't care if you find
a dog or a trash can.

794
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480
Survive somehow.

795
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:57.480
Don't get caught by the chief.

796
01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.200
You're going to kill him?

797
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.700
I'm going to do what I know.

798
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.640
I'm going to catch a bug
and save a sick person.

799
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.939
Mrs. Hong. that's...

800
01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.940
It's not over until one
of the weak is discharged.

801
01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:23.070
You can just get
rid of the healer.

802
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.580
Why are you trying
to shoot a beehive?

803
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.120
It's a real war.

804
01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:36.680
It's hard to walk alone.

805
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:39.220
It's the last time in my life.

806
01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.260
Whether you live or
die. it'll disappear.

807
01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.059
It's up to you from now on.

808
01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:47.760
If you're so worried about
me. put a light on it.

809
01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.440
Fight him.

810
01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.280
Why are you suddenly
coming to me?

811
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.860
If you do that. I'll...

812
01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.960
Mr. Park!

813
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.620
Don't follow me!

814
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:24.430
What is it?

815
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:27.950
Are you happy with
someone else's blood?

816
01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:29.690
There's nothing to do.

817
01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:31.370
What kind of bastard is this?

818
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:39.470
Who is it?

819
01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:40.970
Is it a bug?

820
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:43.629
No. it's not.

821
01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:44.630
Did you get hit by a bee?

822
01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:51.690
Who are you going to die to?

823
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:53.010
What does it matter?

824
01:19:57.850 --> 01:19:59.050
I don't know why you're dying.

825
01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:03.050
Mr. Park!

826
01:20:07.616 --> 01:20:08.736
No.

827
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:21.970
no matter how good you
are. It's too dangerous.

828
01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:23.970
If you go. you'll die.

829
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:29.260
Do it yourself.

830
01:21:18.408 --> 01:21:20.240
What's wrong with him?

831
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.540
Where is he now?

832
01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:22.900
He's crazy.

833
01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.640
What's the reason
for killing his ace?

834
01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.960
Mr. Park.

835
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.700
Every person in
Yeonmi-do has a cutter.

836
01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.136
Kang Bo-mi. the animal hospital.

837
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.920
I saved him because I
had a personal reason.

838
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.060
That's why I gave
up the quarantine.

839
01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.520
It's been too long. Mr. Park.

840
01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:35.480
I'm here.

841
01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:37.220
I'm coming right away.

842
01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.980
If you're old. you're dead.

843
01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.240
Why are you working so hard?

844
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.260
Mr. Song.

845
01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.180
That's a different story.

846
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.860
How much money have
you been making?

847
01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.760
What if you make the
court a pile of money?

848
01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.076
How many times did
you go to the casino?

849
01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:58.360
Mr. Song.

850
01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.460
What are you talking about?

851
01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.060
Let's meet and talk about it.

852
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.120
Hurry up.

853
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.340
What do you want to do?

854
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960
Do you want to apologize?

855
01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.550
It's raining.

856
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:24.750
Let's get out of here.

857
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:26.830
You son of a bitch.

858
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:29.370
Have some on the way.

859
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:34.470
Guys. let's get revenge.

860
01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.580
Hey. don't be scared.

861
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.440
It's not over yet. is it?

862
01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.480
What is it?

863
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600
Is it a son of a bitch?

864
01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.300
Yeah.

865
01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360
It's a family.

866
01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:30.370
Where are you going?

867
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:32.550
Where are you?

868
01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040
Are you okay?

869
01:26:06.452 --> 01:26:07.452
Are you worried?

870
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:08.950
Yes.

871
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:11.630
Then put the tools on your back.

872
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:13.449
You do it yourself.

873
01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:14.650
Mr. Song doesn't want to.

874
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:19.450
Should I go in?

875
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:23.630
Just do what I tell you to do.

876
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.700
Eat before you go.

877
01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.840
Why are you eating with that?

878
01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600
Why?

879
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:10.050
Ordinary people.

880
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:11.790
What?

881
01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:17.660
Ordinary people You've seen
it so often. haven't you?

882
01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.240
How did you get rid of it?

883
01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.260
Useful?

884
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.680
Yes.

885
01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.780
When I was young. At that
time. I was so hungry.

886
01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.800
I stole the bellflower
from the next door.

887
01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.820
But it was a three-year-old.

888
01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.256
I rolled up the house
to pay for the money.

889
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.300
And I got kicked out.

890
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:45.160
While the bride and groom were
fighting. If you do it. you'll get hit.

891
01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.300
Get abandoned. get
beaten up again.

892
01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.180
Everyone. come out and die.

893
01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.800
It's a useless
bitch in the world.

894
01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:58.779
And then...

895
01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:00.360
I'm 16 years old.

896
01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.700
I met someone who
accepted me as a family.

897
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.320
What's your name?

898
01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:06.860
Winsor.

899
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.580
It's a pretty name.

900
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.040
I fed him. I put him to
sleep. I gave him a job.

901
01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.960
And to him. I heard it was
useful for the first time.

902
01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:25.159
Don't avoid it like that.

903
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.540
If you're going to get a reflex. I'm
telling you to stay away from me.

904
01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.516
Hide your head
even if it breaks.

905
01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.540
Okay?

906
01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680
Yes.

907
01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.220
Let's stop here today.

908
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.020
I think this is sacred.

909
01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.200
One of us.

910
01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.060
I'm saving the world.

911
01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.760
Don't let anyone know.

912
01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:53.410
I envy you.

913
01:28:53.890 --> 01:28:57.369
I had a family like that.

914
01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:58.370
There was a time.

915
01:28:58.410 --> 01:28:59.410
Very briefly.

916
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:01.870
What do you think?

917
01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:03.530
Do you remember?

918
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:04.770
When we first met?

919
01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:08.010
Was that 25 years ago?

920
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:12.390
Hi.

921
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:28.510
I'm sorry.

922
01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.159
Wow. this is touching.

923
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.160
I'm sorry.

924
01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:52.560
You know why I'm
looking for you.

925
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.040
Do you really have to leave
your life to someone else?

926
01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:05.780
You have to play with
it until the end.

927
01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.260
You can't get what you want.

928
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.420
Especially when you open your
heart to your colleagues.

929
01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.160
I failed on purpose.

930
01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.680
I thought I would come.

931
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.300
I know.

932
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.060
But you have to find me.

933
01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:44.660
Oh. my God.

934
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:46.180
You...

935
01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.559
You...

936
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:57.560
Think you've been

937
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.040
licked by a beast's claws.

938
01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.880
See you in hell.

939
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:51.655
I should have chosen you.

940
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:58.289
I shouldn't have let you in.

941
01:31:58.290 --> 01:32:03.400
When did you think
I'd let you in?

942
01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.819
I...

943
01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:06.820
For us...

944
01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.300
For the sake of the world.

945
01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560
It's all for us.

946
01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:16.180
Yeah.

947
01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:17.980
I tried.

948
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:21.410
Like your father.

949
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:26.570
What kind of father are you?

950
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.900
Get out of here.

951
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:38.200
Bad things.

952
01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.480
Burn it all here.

953
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:43.980
And you're leaving. too.

954
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:16.250
Oh. yes.

955
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.330
Hello.

956
01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:18.370
Where's Henny?

957
01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:19.790
Oh. Henny?

958
01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:21.650
I came out first.

959
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:23.430
Then I'll look in the bathroom.

960
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:26.370
Then I'll look inside.

961
01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.020
Oh. my God.

962
01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.160
I'm sorry.

963
01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:00.680
It's a sudden mistake.

964
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:02.420
Isn't that too much?

965
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.400
Why are you doing this to me?

966
01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.380
What?

967
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:11.800
Are you going to pretend
you don't know this?

968
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.360
I've been thinking about it
in front of the hell gate.

969
01:34:17.019 --> 01:34:18.019
I felt sorry for Henny.

970
01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:22.420
You're left alone like us.

971
01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.180
I've been through it.
so I know how it feels.

972
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.599
This is against my principles.

973
01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.640
It's a matter of course. but I can't
help it because I'm in a bad mood.

974
01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.080
This is the problem with humans.

975
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.460
If the grass dies. the principles
die and it becomes more meaningless.

976
01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.100
Do you understand?

977
01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:40.000
I've prepared a big party.

978
01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:42.280
Then I'll go alone.

979
01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.020
Happyland Who the hell are you?

980
01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840
What do you want?

981
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.780
You can't follow me.

982
01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.900
I'll bring it.

983
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.580
What are you talking about?

984
01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.699
Trust me.

985
01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.080
You're going to be lucky.

986
01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.660
I'm the one who's
after the people.

987
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.339
It's because I saved it.

988
01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.900
I saved someone I
shouldn't have saved.

989
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.279
I don't regret it.

990
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.800
I saved it.

991
01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.420
It was something I had to do.

992
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.280
Do you remember what I said?

993
01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:36.100
What are you doing?

994
01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:04.160
I'm not against the kids.

995
01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.060
That's what you're
saying. right?

996
01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.300
Don't do it.

997
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.680
Throw it away.

998
01:42:21.450 --> 01:42:22.450
Throw it away.

999
01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:34.350
I thought you were dead.

1000
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:38.289
Is this heaven?

1001
01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:39.290
Is this heaven?

1002
01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.680
I was worried that
revenge would end in vain.

1003
01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:46.620
Well. well. well.

1004
01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:50.356
What's going on in the neighborhood
should have been less and less.

1005
01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:51.680
It's because you're rich.

1006
01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.620
The young man's eyes are bad.

1007
01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:55.500
I've got all the cash.

1008
01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:56.760
Is there a problem?

1009
01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.419
Our kids are all dead
because of this shit.

1010
01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.700
Didn't you know it was a bullet?

1011
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080
Tell me again.

1012
01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:11.910
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1013
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:19.510
Get up.

1014
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:36.390
I'm not an easy opponent.

1015
01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:39.310
I'll go up and beat you up.

1016
01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:41.050
Be careful.

1017
01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:53.370
What's wrong with you?

1018
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:08.068
I'll cut your ears off.

1019
01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:18.640
Nam Won-sik!

1020
01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.400
How can I let my kids go?

1021
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:33.020
What are you talking about?

1022
01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.680
Take it yourself.

1023
01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:38.300
Why are you dragging Kang
Sun-seo between you and me?

1024
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.900
The doctor is the
target to protect.

1025
01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.520
I'm the trash to clean up.

1026
01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.080
What's wrong with you?

1027
01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.080
I don't know.

1028
01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:06.620
Then you're the
trash to throw away.

1029
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:09.180
It's old and useless.

1030
01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.720
I heard you shouldn't throw it
away because it's old and useless.

1031
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:26.490
You can never protect Mr. Kang.

1032
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:28.830
I'm the best.

1033
01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:30.250
All the families.

1034
01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.660
What are you protecting?

1035
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.280
If you keep doing this.
I'll throw it away first.

1036
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:09.570
What should I do with this?

1037
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.430
The winner will
take a foreign car.

1038
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:15.670
You learned it wrong.

1039
01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:21.390
If you chase other people like
that. you'll end up like a bug.

1040
01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.180
I'm sorry.

1041
01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.160
I'm the same.

1042
01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:32.699
Can I kill you?

1043
01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:37.030
Yeah. I wasn't going to.

1044
01:47:10.647 --> 01:47:12.536
Are you done?

1045
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:19.750
No.

1046
01:47:25.849 --> 01:47:27.290
When is your dad coming in?

1047
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:30.070
It's past 12 o'clock.

1048
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:32.370
There are a lot of days
when I don't come in.

1049
01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.700
I'm going to sleep now.

1050
01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:41.560
What song do you listen to?

1051
01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.600
This?

1052
01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:51.040
Listen to it when you're
having a hard time.

1053
01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:56.220
This isn't it.

1054
01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.240
Are you giving this to me?

1055
01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.560
Yeah.

1056
01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.230
It's unfair to have two.

1057
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:19.530
Should I throw one away?

1058
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:22.750
You'll regret it when you do.

1059
01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.860
I'm sure I gave it back to you.

1060
01:48:43.330 --> 01:48:44.330
Thank you.

1061
01:48:48.570 --> 01:48:52.490
Get out of here.

1062
01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:01.810
When your father comes back from making
money. I told you to come out and say hello.

1063
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.950
I'm not going to do it.

1064
01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:05.010
I don't know who you are.

1065
01:49:06.130 --> 01:49:07.990
You idiot.

1066
01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:10.230
Sir.

1067
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:13.660
You idiot.

1068
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:39.510
That's all you've got?

1069
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.020
I've been kidnapped.

1070
01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.920
Please give me a
call from my dad.

1071
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.760
Of course.

1072
01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.160
Hurry up and get me out of here.

1073
01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:20.800
Remember.

1074
01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.040
This is a seed that my
grandmother sprayed.

1075
01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.480
Unlike anyone else. You
have to keep your promise.

1076
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:32.750
Goodbye.

1077
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:50.290
Why are you still here?

1078
01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:01.870
I'm running out of time.

1079
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.480
Because of me.

1080
01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:15.060
Please.

1081
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:10.870
Dad.

1082
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:17.120
Don't be too hard on yourself.

1083
01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:24.400
I'm here now.

1084
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:38.970
I'm going to win this time.

1085
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:42.669
You...

1086
01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:43.670
You can't do that.

1087
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.280
I'm pretending.

1088
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Have a good day.

1089
01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:07.750
Make sure you take your lunch.

1090
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:13.069
You did a good job.

1091
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:21.070
I don't think I
can recognize you.

1092
01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.240
Where are you going?

1093
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:42.630
I didn't see anything.

1094
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:51.340
Next time. If you do that.

1095
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:29.530
Why are you doing this to me?

1096
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.920
I'm scared.

1097
01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.160
What if I don't remember?

1098
01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:01.060
Do you remember now?

1099
01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:09.920
How?

1100
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:11.620
I'm going to kill you.

1101
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.779
I'm going to kill you.

1102
01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:19.180
Promise me.

1103
01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.460
There will be a day when you
become stronger than your father.

1104
01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.520
Until then. let's tie the sword.

1105
01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.260
Let's tie it up today.

1106
01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.160
Tomorrow will be better.

1107
01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:35.920
Let's do it together.

1108
01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.960
What?

1109
01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:39.160
Can't we go to Happy Land?

1110
01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.280
Happy Land?

1111
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.480
It's an amusement park.

1112
01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.480
No.

1113
01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.860
I'm bragging that I've been
to all the amusement parks.

1114
01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.240
No.

1115
01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:01.180
Yes.

1116
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.200
You're lying.

1117
01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.040
You didn't answer me.

1118
01:56:12.450 --> 01:56:18.750
You still have a long way to go.

1119
01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:28.840
Yes.

1120
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:31.940
I'm not going to swallow pills.

1121
01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:38.460
I'm sorry.

1122
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:06.620
We're family.

1123
01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.260
I'm not doing this
to protect you.

1124
01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:44.960
We are nothing more
than broken people.

1125
01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:54.049
It's not bad to love loss.

1126
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:57.370
I don't think it's a
bad idea to love him.

1127
01:58:05.890 --> 01:58:07.780
I was locked up in prison.

1128
01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.160
A man who accuses me.

1129
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.100
He's a liar.

1130
01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:14.200
Who is that?

1131
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.760
I've never done anything wrong.

1132
01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:28.379
And it's not time
for you to go yet.

1133
01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:30.340
It's not time for
you to come yet.

1134
01:58:36.769 --> 01:58:38.130
You have a lot to do.

1134
01:58:39.305 --> 01:59:39.787
