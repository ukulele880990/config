I28.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.746
- B6.
- B6.

4
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.790
G19.

5
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.237
Cal?

6
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:11.043
Okay. let's start from the beginning.
What exactly do we know?

7
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:15.130
We know Havlock hired a black hat
out of Russia to steal Archive 6.

8
00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:18.509
We know the hacker vanished. but not
before giving the Archive to a courier.

9
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.219
AKA Vincent Thiago.

10
00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.720
Fake name. Fake papers. Fake everything.

11
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.306
And the one thing we know about
the Courier is that he arrived here

12
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.099
24 hours before the crash.

13
00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.851
Which suggests that
he knew about the crash.

14
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.187
waiting to meet Havlock
and hand off the Archive.

15
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.481
But how did they know
Havlock was gonna crash here?

16
00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:36.652
Unless the two of them chose to put
the plane down exactly where they did.

17
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.571
Why? What's here? What's in Alaska?

18
00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:42.824
Bears. spam.
mosquitos bigger than most birds.

19
00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:46.662
What is that?

20
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:50.249
They are hosting a shindig at the Mecca
to raise money for Donnie's family.

21
00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:52.793
There's beer. food. Dancing if I'm lucky.

22
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.129
Beer and dancing at a funeral?
During a manhunt?

23
00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:59.550
It's not a funeral.
It's what our tribes call a potlatch.

24
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:02.302
You know. when one of our people
passes away. the whole community shows up.

25
00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.513
donates what they can to help
ease the workload for the family.

26
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:08.475
Frank. I got a trooper on line two.
Says it's urgent.

27
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:09.560
Remnick.

28
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.271
Hey. Frank.

29
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.023
It's good to hear your voice again.

30
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.484
On it.

31
00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:20.571
I thought I might be finding your body
right about now on the Alaskan tundra.

32
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.031
You know. sometimes it's good
to not get what you want.

33
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:25.492
It's a stroke of luck. How you feeling?

34
00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.286
Sore and tired. you?

35
00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:30.038
Pretty good.

36
00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:33.458
Considering I survived
a plane crash and a manhunt.

37
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.252
Alaska is not done with you yet.

38
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.129
Inspector Briggs. where is she?

39
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.923
We got a call. live now. He's on line two.

40
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:41.383
Okay.

41
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.927
I've been reading more about you. Frank.

42
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:48.307
About your time in Chicago
and your return home.

43
00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.728
I had no idea you lost a daughter.

44
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.356
Sorry. Frank. I can't imagine.

45
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.233
Did you call to talk about my daughter?

46
00:05:58.317 --> 00:05:59.902
No. I called to talk to you

47
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:03.530
because the path we're on requires
that we understand each other.

48
00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:05.824
And to do that.
I need to speak to you privately.

49
00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:07.409
Can you take me off speakerphone. please?

50
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.912
How about you turn yourself in.
we talk all you want.

51
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.414
I'm serious. Frank. This is important.

52
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.249
Pick up the phone.

53
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.337
Bradford's afraid of
your dead man's switch.

54
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.130
She wants a ceasefire.

55
00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:21.882
She's willing to negotiate.

56
00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.551
I loved you. Sidney.

57
00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:27.721
And yet. here you are. hunting me down.

58
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:29.848
Which is why I need to speak to Frank.

59
00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:32.351
Frank. please pick up the phone.

60
00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.977
I don't wanna do this
in front of everyone.

61
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.522
- Do what?
- Talk about our secret.

62
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.029
Thank you. Frank.

63
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.365
You know. it's important for me
to demonstrate to you

64
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:47.741
that I'm a man of my word.

65
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.952
I handed back your wife.

66
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.789
I stayed quiet about the weapon
you had hidden in your home.

67
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:59.837
And in exchange. all I want from you…
is to answer a question.

68
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:02.881
Just one question.

69
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:04.716
What's the question?

70
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.803
You have to promise
to answer truthfully. Frank.

71
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.681
- Will you?
- What's the question?

72
00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.474
It's pretty simple. Frank.

73
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:15.769
Can I trust you?

74
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.064
Take your time. Answer truthfully.

75
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.691
Can I trust you?

76
00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:22.985
Yes or no?

77
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.362
Yes.

78
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:27.489
Thank you. Frank.

79
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.788
I got it. It's local.
And it's a fixed number.

80
00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:37.040
Contact the phone company.
see who's been assigned that number.

81
00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:38.125
Do it now. go.

82
00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:58.145
- Frank!
- Yeah?

83
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.272
Sarah.

84
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.566
- Sarah?
- Frank?

85
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.818
They're gone. They're not--
They're not at the cabin.

86
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:06.278
Luke and Kira. they're gone.

87
00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.487
Whoa. whoa. slow down. What?

88
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.740
And the trooper. he's dead.

89
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:10.782
Where are you?

90
00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:12.993
I'm at the-- the gas station
at the bottom of the mountain.

91
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.953
Okay. Stay exactly where you are.
I'm gonna come to you.

92
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:16.413
- Frank.
- Hang on. Yeah?

93
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.373
A hunter just found
Kira Moore and she's alive.

94
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.542
- What about Luke?
- She said he's with an inmate.

95
00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:23.754
We're gonna find Luke.
I love you. I'm handing you over to Hutch.

96
00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.089
Get troopers en route.
issue an Amber Alert.

97
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.633
Tell Air Care I need their chopper.

98
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.884
Havlock is gonna have to wait.

99
00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:29.968
Go.

100
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.104
- Where is she?
- She's with our village health aide.

101
00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:42.940
She lost consciousness
but she's awake now.

102
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.441
- You the guy that found her?
- Yes. sir.

103
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.860
I found her along
the trail about four miles back.

104
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.241
Lorna. Susie.

105
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.327
You okay?

106
00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:58.372
Oh. come here. Come here.

107
00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.581
I'm so sorry.

108
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.834
Oh. don't you be sorry. okay?

109
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.587
Look at me.
You have nothing to be sorry about.

110
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.047
Okay? You're safe.

111
00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:10.592
We're gonna get you some help.

112
00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.555
Yeah? While we do.

113
00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:18.809
I need you to look at some photos
and help me identify the man who has Luke.

114
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.031
- Is that him?
- No.

115
00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:34.616
You ain't gonna shoot me.

116
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:36.910
You had your chance and didn't.

117
00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:39.288
- That's the guy.
- You sure?

118
00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:41.039
- Positive.
- Yeah?

119
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.917
Okay. it's okay. You're okay. Come here.

120
00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:46.003
I will. I swear I will.

121
00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:50.966
Kill me. you'll see my face
every time you close your eyes.

122
00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:58.015
- How far to the highway?
- It's eight miles by road.

123
00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.266
Two on the trail.

124
00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.767
I'll get my snow machine.

125
00:10:05.898 --> 00:10:09.234
Sarah. what are you doing here?
I sent the troopers to the cabin.

126
00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.652
- Is Luke here?
- No.

127
00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:12.779
Hutch said he's with an inmate.
Do you know where?

128
00:10:12.863 --> 00:10:14.823
No. But I know who he is
and where he was.

129
00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.700
Kira said there was an
accident on the highway.

130
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:17.868
What are… You drove her here?

131
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.244
Well. she insisted.

132
00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:20.704
Okay. yeah. well. I need your keys.

133
00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.372
My God. I'm coming with you.

134
00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.041
Maybe I should come with you.

135
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.417
- No.
- No. You stay here.

136
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:26.668
Well. I wanna help.

137
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.671
Listen. Kira Moore is inside the cabin.

138
00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.173
Okay. the girl's been through hell.

139
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.966
Check up on her. Notify her mom.

140
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.468
Okay.

141
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.053
What about my truck?

142
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:39.181
Your truck's finally gonna be
driven like a fucking truck.

143
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.043
Hello?

144
00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:09.878
Anybody there?

145
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.472
Give me the keys.

146
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.355
You motherfucker.

147
00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.109
Thanks.

148
00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:42.286
I don't know how to drive this thing.

149
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.288
Well. you better figure it out.
Puddin' Ting.

150
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.456
You and I got a job to do.

151
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.262
- How long ago did it happen?
- He's live now.

152
00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.638
Do we have a location for him?

153
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.477
It's him. ma'am. It's Havlock.

154
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:10.147
We were trying to disable the dead man's
switch he tied to the Archive

155
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.231
when he came online.

156
00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:12.608
- This is him typing?
- Yes.

157
00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.818
Been at it for well over a minute
which suggests he's using

158
00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.446
some kind of multifactor password
to reset the switch.

159
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.281
- He's still alive.
- And still a threat.

160
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.908
Does this tell us
anything about where he is?

161
00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:22.492
He's bouncing signals around the globe.

162
00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.454
We can't even unravel
his primary layer of encryption.

163
00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:28.916
Junie. I want you to disable this switch.
and I want you to know

164
00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:32.711
you have the full resources
of the Agency to find a work-around.

165
00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:33.795
Can you do that?

166
00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:35.672
- Yes. ma'am.
- Good. Do your job.

167
00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:37.716
Get to work. Do it now.

168
00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:44.932
That was the phone company.

169
00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.476
They confirmed the number
we picked up on our PEN register

170
00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.604
came from Klondike Lodge.
Parks Highway. room 130.

171
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.189
It's Havlock. He's there.

172
00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.941
How fast can you get a warrant?

173
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.824
Fairbanks PD.

174
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:04.952
Clear.

175
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.454
Clear.

176
00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:21.718
All clear.

177
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.601
He was here.

178
00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:31.603
Tear it apart.

179
00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.595
Frank. I've been digging in.
This guy who has your son is a problem.

180
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.931
Romero's clinically paranoid
and criminally insane.

181
00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:11.059
He graduated from
the Naval Academy with honors.

182
00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:13.270
Majored in robotics
and control engineering.

183
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.897
Worked postgrad with DARPA

184
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.441
where he built
all kinds of surveillance tools.

185
00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:19.276
So where'd it go wrong?

186
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.360
According to the court records.

187
00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:23.280
Romero believed his superiors
at DARPA were spying on him.

188
00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.990
Through his computer. his phone.

189
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.075
He evidently had
some kind of psychological break.

190
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.703
Two weeks later
he killed six federal employees.

191
00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:32.539
Bombing structures he believed
were government listening posts.

192
00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:35.375
He also murdered his neighbor.
pulled three of his own teeth

193
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:38.253
and dismembered his dog
while searching for listening devices.

194
00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:40.088
- Oh. my God.
- Kira said she overheard Romero

195
00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:42.633
talking about taking revenge on
an old mistress. Does that ring a bell?

196
00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.009
Nothing here about a woman.

197
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:47.346
Get into his life. See if there's an ex
or female officer he worked with.

198
00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:48.680
I need to know where he's going.

199
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:52.684
Also. Frank. we traced
Havlock's call to a local hotel here.

200
00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:54.102
It was paid for by the Courier.

201
00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:57.314
Right. not now. Stay with Romero.
I need to know where he's going.

202
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.363
I thought they were both gonna be safe.
okay? I did. I just…

203
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.658
With everything going on
with the investigation. with you it…

204
00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:11.620
Say something.

205
00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:13.372
What do you want me to say?

206
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.834
There's nothing to say
because nothing is fine.

207
00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:21.380
Fuck. I'm scared. I'm overwhelmed

208
00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:24.132
and the fact that this happened
on your watch is beyond.

209
00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.260
So no. I don't want to talk.

210
00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:27.302
I want you to fix this.

211
00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:29.596
I want a solution
and I want to find our son.

212
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.307
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

213
00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:35.227
What happened?

214
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.062
- Fucker took a shot at me.
- Who did? What happened?

215
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.523
I saw the vehicle so I stopped
to see if everyone was okay.

216
00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.608
Was one of them this boy?

217
00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:43.861
- Yeah. that's him.
- Was he hurt?

218
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:44.945
Well. they were both hurt.

219
00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:47.406
The boy's our son. He's been taken
hostage by a federal inmate.

220
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.199
I need the make
and the model of your vehicle.

221
00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.535
I don't know. It's not mine.
It's a state truck.

222
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.287
- It's a salt spreader with a plow.
- Salt spreader. okay.

223
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.580
Okay. which way did they go?

224
00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:56.039
- East.
- Go! Go!

225
00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.416
We'll send help.

226
00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:02.129
Hey.

227
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.300
Earlier on the phone.
what did Havlock mean when he told Frank

228
00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.385
he didn't want to talk about
their secret in front of us?

229
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.803
What was that about?

230
00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:11.471
Probably some bullshit.

231
00:16:12.598 --> 00:16:14.975
Yeah. that's what I thought.

232
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.665
They're not his. All three belong
to his friend the Courier.

233
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.668
We know Havlock called from this room.

234
00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:43.629
The manager told me
the Courier paid in cash.

235
00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.340
This must be some kind of
safe house or pick up point.

236
00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:52.804
Scofield.

237
00:16:52.888 --> 00:16:54.389
Are you ducking my calls?

238
00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:58.227
No. I'm not ducking your calls.
Cell towers are out.

239
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.395
And I only have Wi-Fi calling
which is for shit.

240
00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:01.688
Mom fell again.

241
00:17:01.772 --> 00:17:04.316
- Is she okay?
- No. She's a mess.

242
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:06.318
Did you hear about the phones?

243
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.403
Mom said men were here yesterday

244
00:17:08.487 --> 00:17:11.323
because Dad ordered
a new phone line for himself.

245
00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.117
Need I remind you Dad hasn't made
a phone call in nearly two decades.

246
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.496
- Okay. I'm sure there's a reason--
- They diagnosed her. Sid.

247
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.249
It's official. Vascular dementia.

248
00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:21.791
Well. we should get another opinion.

249
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:24.252
I don't expect you to understand.
You're like Dad that way.

250
00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.963
Okay. that's not fair.

251
00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:28.089
We're putting Mom in a home.

252
00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.466
I thought you should know.

253
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.678
- Molly?
- I gotta go. She's calling me.

254
00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:38.058
What did you find?

255
00:17:42.271 --> 00:17:43.772
The Archive.

256
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.276
- Bag it up. Bag it all up.
- Yeah. Okay.

257
00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:01.164
What is this place?

258
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.073
What are we doing here?

259
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:38.994
I was one of the watchers.

260
00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:43.540
It was my job to observe people.
Study their private lives.

261
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.420
See. the government. they think that
if they can keep an eye on people.

262
00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:50.255
they can keep them quiet.

263
00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:51.798
Control them.

264
00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:54.218
But I know people.

265
00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:57.221
I've been analyzing them for years.

266
00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.182
And the truth is…

267
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:03.310
the actuality…

268
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.190
is that chaos is our natural state.

269
00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.443
People are messy. They're broken.

270
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:15.697
But that ain't no reason
for the government to fuck with us.

271
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:29.461
Give me a hand.

272
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.673
Come on.

273
00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.302
Grab that end.

274
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:51.942
What is this?

275
00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:57.781
This. kid. is a surprise
that those fuckers will never see coming.

276
00:19:58.657 --> 00:20:00.284
Now for the fun part.

277
00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:08.000
How'd your talk with Todd go?

278
00:20:09.168 --> 00:20:12.379
Well. it's… it's hard to explain.

279
00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.549
Maybe you wanna try?

280
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:22.764
I feel like we're not being
honest with each other.

281
00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:27.978
Okay.

282
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.606
- And I think we need to talk.
- About what?

283
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.444
Frank. Marks here. Do you copy?

284
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:39.823
Go for Frank.

285
00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:43.160
We got an APB on that salt truck
but we may have something else.

286
00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:46.580
Report came in on an unmanned
AP&E substation.

287
00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:49.291
Twenty minutes ago. operations got
a power failure notification.

288
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.752
What. you think that has
something to do with Luke?

289
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.670
Where is this substation?

290
00:21:21.782 --> 00:21:22.866
Yeah. they were here.

291
00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:26.286
Shit! To the car! Back to the truck!

292
00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.253
- Okay?
- Yeah.

293
00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.218
Hutch.

294
00:21:42.678 --> 00:21:44.221
Consider what you're about to do.

295
00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:45.597
I'm following protocol.

296
00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:48.600
That drive represents
a threat to national security.

297
00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:53.146
If you give the Archive to the FBI.
it enters the chain of custody.

298
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.065
And we're shut out.

299
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.608
I'm not debating this.

300
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.616
Wait until I hear from the CIA.
Frank would agree.

301
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.869
Frank's only concern is his son. okay?

302
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:11.039
Besides we already lost the flight
recorder. I'm not losing this too.

303
00:22:11.123 --> 00:22:12.165
This is protocol.

304
00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:15.669
If Havlock left it behind.
he did so for a reason.

305
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.088
We didn't find this drive by accident.

306
00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:19.756
This is a trap.

307
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:22.759
I'm giving this drive to OSI.

308
00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:27.472
What if he wants us to send it to Eielson
because it's some kind of Trojan horse?

309
00:22:28.557 --> 00:22:30.142
Now you're sounding paranoid.

310
00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:32.603
- That it?
- That's it.

311
00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:38.275
Havlock wants us to find
that drive and turn it in to evidence.

312
00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:39.735
Just like you're doing.

313
00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:42.654
Yeah. well. remind me to say thank you
when we haul his ass in. okay?

314
00:22:49.912 --> 00:22:51.622
Frank. I think I got something.

315
00:22:52.122 --> 00:22:53.415
I've been digging into Romero's past.

316
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:55.792
This guy's posted dozens of online videos

317
00:22:55.876 --> 00:22:58.962
pointing out facilities he thinks
are threats to privacy.

318
00:22:59.046 --> 00:23:02.299
Embassies. cell towers.
all kinds of military bases.

319
00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:03.842
Which got me thinking.

320
00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:07.054
Romero said he was gonna
get revenge on an old mistress.

321
00:23:07.137 --> 00:23:08.805
But what if we got that wrong?

322
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:11.850
You don't think she's a person?

323
00:23:12.643 --> 00:23:13.727
I think she's a place.

324
00:23:16.188 --> 00:23:18.065
Where do these power lines go?

325
00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:21.652
Delta Junction. Tok…

326
00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.362
Isn't Gakona in that direction?

327
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:25.072
That's where HAARP's located.

328
00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:28.283
Listen. Cole. the power substation
Romero hit feeds electricity

329
00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:31.203
to a military research laboratory
south of here.

330
00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:32.204
That's what he's targeting.

331
00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:34.998
And he's going after
a military research facility.

332
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.298
What is this place?

333
00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:46.468
This bitch is our target.

334
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.518
Langley said Thiago's passports are all
fake and his prints aren't in the system.

335
00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:58.272
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Thanks.
- Cole?

336
00:23:59.273 --> 00:24:00.440
- Hello?
- Hey.

337
00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:02.025
Sidney?

338
00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.445
Can I interest you in a raffle ticket?

339
00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:07.614
A raffle ticket?

340
00:24:07.698 --> 00:24:08.866
The event tonight.

341
00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:10.284
For Donnie.

342
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:12.369
Oh. right. The potlatch.

343
00:24:13.328 --> 00:24:14.329
What are you raffling?

344
00:24:14.413 --> 00:24:15.455
We got all kinds of good stuff.

345
00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:20.127
We got a drum of gas. some firewood.
cute little hand-knitted hat too.

346
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.131
We got a smoked moose as well. unless
you're a vegan. you might hate that but…

347
00:24:24.214 --> 00:24:25.340
Twenty bucks.

348
00:24:26.258 --> 00:24:28.427
I'll pray for the drum of gas.

349
00:24:30.012 --> 00:24:31.805
Your cell phone service is shit.

350
00:24:38.937 --> 00:24:40.397
The telephone.

351
00:24:41.273 --> 00:24:42.941
They're fucking listening.

352
00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:46.778
Do you have a phone I can borrow?

353
00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:51.992
- You buying anything?
- A vodka. Neat.

354
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.338
- Hello?
- Molly. thank God.

355
00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:07.382
We need to talk. You said that Mom
imagined a conversation she had

356
00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:08.759
with men at the phone company.

357
00:25:08.842 --> 00:25:11.803
She didn't imagine it.
Someone was at the house.

358
00:25:11.887 --> 00:25:12.721
Who was?

359
00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:16.183
I think the Bureau got a warrant
and they're listening on Mom's line.

360
00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:17.851
You gotta stay off that line.

361
00:25:17.935 --> 00:25:20.062
Sid. you're scaring me. What is going on?

362
00:25:20.145 --> 00:25:22.773
Don't talk to anyone you don't know.
Don't let anyone in the house.

363
00:25:22.856 --> 00:25:25.817
And if you see something
suspicious. you call me.

364
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:28.237
- Do you understand?
- Is this about your legal case?

365
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.905
Do you understand?

366
00:25:29.988 --> 00:25:33.325
Phone's bugged. People watching.
Yeah. I understand.

367
00:25:34.201 --> 00:25:36.245
Sidney. I'm picking Zoe up from school.

368
00:25:36.328 --> 00:25:38.247
She's literally walking
to the car right now.

369
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.583
So I don't want to freak her out
with your crazy work shit. okay?

370
00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:44.711
I'm hanging up the phone but if
we're in danger. you need to call me.

371
00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:46.964
Okay? Now I'm hanging up the phone.

372
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.678
What's this?

373
00:25:53.262 --> 00:25:54.263
From your husband.

374
00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:58.976
Got time for another?

375
00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:06.441
General Thatcher. afternoon.
Deputy Marshal Steven Cole.

376
00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:08.026
Have you been briefed on the situation?

377
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.570
We're aware of the outage.

378
00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:11.154
The outage was triggered
by an escaped convict

379
00:26:11.238 --> 00:26:13.115
who we believe may be
targeting the HAARP facility.

380
00:26:13.198 --> 00:26:15.492
HAARP. What's that mean?

381
00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:18.662
The High-frequency
Active Auroral Research Program.

382
00:26:18.745 --> 00:26:20.998
It was part of the old DARPA program.

383
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:22.207
Is there a credible threat?

384
00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:26.378
Nothing specific but the station that was
taken offline feeds power to HAARP.

385
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:28.463
We think it's the first strike
in a larger attack.

386
00:26:28.547 --> 00:26:29.840
I don't know what any of that means.

387
00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:33.385
It means they're testing out new ways
to listen to anyone they want to.

388
00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:35.762
Can they really do that?

389
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:38.432
As smart as your fugitive may be.

390
00:26:38.515 --> 00:26:41.185
HAARP has contingencies
for incidents just like this.

391
00:26:41.268 --> 00:26:44.771
They can prepare all they want.
but the power supply.

392
00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:46.773
that's how you take
a big girl like this down.

393
00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:48.775
The moment that substation lost power.

394
00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:52.863
the HAARP network detected a fault
and switched to reserve battery backup.

395
00:26:52.946 --> 00:26:54.198
It's siloed and secure.

396
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:57.117
That's what they think.
but nothing's ever really secure.

397
00:26:57.201 --> 00:26:59.286
- I don't want to hurt anyone.
- Tighten up. kid.

398
00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:01.079
We're about to make history.

399
00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:08.629
You look tired.

400
00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:11.507
Did you follow me from the hotel?

401
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.426
You got to take care of yourself.

402
00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:16.762
Are you my fucking doctor?

403
00:27:16.845 --> 00:27:18.805
No. I'm looking out for you.

404
00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:21.350
It's what I do.
It's what I've always done.

405
00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:24.269
I don't have to trust you
to care about you. Sid.

406
00:27:24.353 --> 00:27:26.396
- Where's the Archive?
- It's safe.

407
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.190
- Is it here?
- You tell me.

408
00:27:28.941 --> 00:27:30.692
Did your team find it in my hotel room?

409
00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:33.487
Is this funny to you?

410
00:27:35.197 --> 00:27:36.198
No.

411
00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:38.116
Why are you smiling?

412
00:27:39.243 --> 00:27:40.786
Because you're doing
that thing with your mouth.

413
00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:43.956
Where you bite your bottom lip
when you feel out of control.

414
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:47.876
Yeah. well. you're acting
like an overly confident prick

415
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.711
and I'm not really sure why.

416
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.841
Actually. I am. You're enjoying this.

417
00:27:53.924 --> 00:27:55.384
Yeah. I'm enjoying this.

418
00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:57.928
Being chased. Being hunted.

419
00:27:58.011 --> 00:28:00.472
And being off-book.
making it up as you go.

420
00:28:01.098 --> 00:28:03.725
You always did your best work
when the plan went to shit

421
00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:05.102
and you had to think on your feet.

422
00:28:05.185 --> 00:28:06.353
Like Vienna.

423
00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:09.189
This is nothing like Vienna.

424
00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:11.692
Why are you here?

425
00:28:12.401 --> 00:28:13.485
Why risk it?

426
00:28:15.654 --> 00:28:16.864
To see you.

427
00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:20.784
Attempting to figure out
how you fit into all this.

428
00:28:20.868 --> 00:28:22.160
Whose side you're on.

429
00:28:22.244 --> 00:28:25.789
I want to believe that the Agency's
so desperate that they need you but…

430
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:28.500
my gut says you have another agenda.

431
00:28:28.584 --> 00:28:29.793
Don't listen to your gut.

432
00:28:29.877 --> 00:28:30.752
Why not?

433
00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:33.755
Because I'm literally
the one person you can trust.

434
00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:35.507
- Prove it.
- How?

435
00:28:37.301 --> 00:28:38.510
Come with me.

436
00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:40.929
Let's disappear.

437
00:28:41.013 --> 00:28:43.265
- That's not gonna happen.
- We could go anywhere.

438
00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.392
With the Archive. we're untouchable.

439
00:28:46.977 --> 00:28:48.228
Think about it.

440
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:51.440
You. me. Some beach in Goa.

441
00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:53.901
How bad could it be?

442
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.988
I should go.

443
00:28:58.822 --> 00:29:00.240
Thank you for the beer.

444
00:29:23.096 --> 00:29:26.225
He's gonna be okay.
Luke is going to be okay.

445
00:29:26.308 --> 00:29:27.392
Please don't say that.

446
00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:29.686
What do you want me to say?
That I'm worried?

447
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.438
That I've got no idea where our son is?

448
00:29:31.522 --> 00:29:34.441
Yeah. Because then at least
that would be honest.

449
00:29:35.067 --> 00:29:36.109
What does that mean?

450
00:29:39.154 --> 00:29:40.906
Fuck. Frank. I lied to you.

451
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:43.200
I lied to you about the abduction.

452
00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:44.993
Havlock. he…

453
00:29:46.912 --> 00:29:48.539
he gave me this.

454
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.083
What is that?

455
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.501
It's a recording of the crash.

456
00:29:52.584 --> 00:29:54.419
And that woman from the CIA. Sidney.

457
00:29:54.503 --> 00:29:59.299
she thought he might try to manipulate
you by passing me something. and so I…

458
00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:01.343
I told her that he didn't.

459
00:30:01.426 --> 00:30:02.845
Havlock gave you that?

460
00:30:02.928 --> 00:30:05.597
- Yeah. And I didn't give it--
- You lied to me. Sarah.

461
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.807
Yeah. I should have told you.

462
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.684
Sarah. it's evidence.

463
00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:11.270
- Okay? Evidence.
- Frank. slow down!

464
00:30:11.353 --> 00:30:12.980
Slow down!

465
00:30:15.482 --> 00:30:18.485
I know what it is
to be a cop's wife. all right?

466
00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:19.862
I understand my life.

467
00:30:19.945 --> 00:30:23.073
But don't you see
what this is doing to this family?

468
00:30:23.156 --> 00:30:24.616
What? Huh? What do you
want me to fucking do?

469
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.035
You were about to get drawn
further into this case. all right?

470
00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:31.123
I had a choice to make
and I chose to protect you.

471
00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:32.708
Where are you going?

472
00:30:32.791 --> 00:30:34.001
Fuck. Fuck.

473
00:30:39.715 --> 00:30:41.133
Frank. I love you.

474
00:30:41.967 --> 00:30:45.053
And I hate that I lied to you.
but don't you see?

475
00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:47.598
This is just another example
of how broken we've become.

476
00:30:52.352 --> 00:30:54.271
Say something!

477
00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:55.689
Road salt.

478
00:30:56.273 --> 00:30:58.483
From a state maintainer
like the one Luke's in.

479
00:30:59.735 --> 00:31:01.695
- So?
- This isn't a state road.

480
00:31:03.197 --> 00:31:04.656
He's leaving us a trail.

481
00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:37.231
Get walkin'.

482
00:31:41.443 --> 00:31:43.153
Set it down right here.

483
00:31:48.367 --> 00:31:49.368
Turn this on.

484
00:31:56.708 --> 00:32:00.504
This is Electronics Technician
Second Class Isaac Romero speaking.

485
00:32:00.587 --> 00:32:04.675
In the coming days you'll be told
I was mentally unfit to serve.

486
00:32:05.551 --> 00:32:07.427
That I have a grudge
against my own government.

487
00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:10.097
And that I'm a domestic terrorist.

488
00:32:10.639 --> 00:32:11.807
All are true.

489
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:16.311
What is also true is the US government
has been monitoring your every move.

490
00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:19.273
I know this because
I was one of the listeners.

491
00:32:19.356 --> 00:32:23.944
This is why I have a moral duty
to provide the solution.

492
00:32:24.027 --> 00:32:27.656
Behind me is a High-frequency
Active Auroral Research station.

493
00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:31.660
It is. in fact.
not a research station at all.

494
00:32:31.743 --> 00:32:35.455
But the heartbeat of a mass surveillance
program that must be terminated.

495
00:32:36.915 --> 00:32:40.961
Taking it offline
will have a ripple effect.

496
00:32:42.296 --> 00:32:44.214
The darkness that follows will…

497
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:47.759
be painful.

498
00:32:48.844 --> 00:32:50.762
Lives will be lost and for that I'm…

499
00:32:53.223 --> 00:32:54.766
for that I'm sorry.

500
00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:08.447
Stop it!

501
00:33:10.908 --> 00:33:13.285
- The hell's wrong with you?
- You already hurt too many people.

502
00:33:13.368 --> 00:33:15.078
I won't let you hurt anyone else.

503
00:33:15.162 --> 00:33:17.039
What is that? You transmitting?

504
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:19.082
What is that? Are you…

505
00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:20.292
That's a fucking tuning coil.

506
00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:22.336
No. it's my palate expander.

507
00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:24.463
You've been transmitting this whole time.

508
00:33:25.047 --> 00:33:26.340
You're one of them.

509
00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:28.467
- What are you doing?
- Open your…

510
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.093
Open your mouth.

511
00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:32.262
- No! Stop!
- Open your fucking mouth.

512
00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:33.180
This is coming out.

513
00:33:33.263 --> 00:33:34.973
Only my orthodontist can do that--

514
00:33:35.057 --> 00:33:36.683
Open your fucking mouth!

515
00:33:41.188 --> 00:33:42.481
Listen!

516
00:33:42.564 --> 00:33:43.565
Listen!

517
00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:47.361
What is that?

518
00:33:52.783 --> 00:33:54.201
What the hell is this?

519
00:33:54.701 --> 00:33:55.786
It's a repeater.

520
00:33:56.662 --> 00:33:58.872
They made me wear it.
I didn't have a choice. I swear.

521
00:33:58.956 --> 00:34:00.082
Who made you wear it?

522
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:03.168
The people who downed your plane.

523
00:34:04.503 --> 00:34:07.047
I don't have any names.
but I'll tell you everything I know.

524
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.341
I promise.
if you please just put the gun down.

525
00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:13.512
This ain't no repeater. This is
some fucking kid's little plastic toy…

526
00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:36.659
Hey!

527
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:43.250
Get on the radio. call for help.

528
00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:45.043
Stay in the car.

529
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.142
Gonna find you. Luke.

530
00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:18.869
Luke…

531
00:35:23.707 --> 00:35:24.833
Luke…

532
00:35:26.168 --> 00:35:27.169
Freeze!

533
00:35:49.733 --> 00:35:51.235
Tell your dad to put the gun down.

534
00:35:51.318 --> 00:35:52.945
Put the gun down. Dad.

535
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.364
Put it down or I'll shoot.

536
00:35:56.365 --> 00:35:57.866
I said put it down.

537
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:04.665
- Back up.
- Give me my son. okay?

538
00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:08.126
Okay. listen.

539
00:36:08.752 --> 00:36:11.922
Take me and give me the boy. okay?

540
00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:14.383
Throw the gun over here.
and I'll give you the kid.

541
00:36:15.926 --> 00:36:17.219
Here it is. okay?

542
00:36:18.178 --> 00:36:20.514
Take me instead. Okay? Come on.

543
00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:25.352
Come here. come here. come here.
No. no. no. no. no.

544
00:36:25.435 --> 00:36:27.855
Come on. I got you. No. Okay.

545
00:36:34.736 --> 00:36:38.824
What the fuck. Luke! Oh. come here.

546
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:43.120
Let me look at you.
Are you all right? Oh. baby.

547
00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:44.204
Fuck.

548
00:36:46.623 --> 00:36:48.375
Oh. my God.

549
00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:53.297
Come on.

550
00:37:22.284 --> 00:37:28.123
So. there are others out there like him?

551
00:37:30.042 --> 00:37:31.043
Yeah.

552
00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:48.644
And one of them killed…

553
00:37:49.394 --> 00:37:52.022
Donnie died on the operating table. Luke.

554
00:37:53.524 --> 00:37:54.942
Annie's heartbroken.

555
00:37:56.193 --> 00:37:58.487
We're having a get-together
at the Mecca bar tonight.

556
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.621
I wanna see Kira.

557
00:38:08.288 --> 00:38:09.331
You will.

558
00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:13.001
She's… She's at the hospital.

559
00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:15.337
Which is where we're taking you.

560
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.130
Mom. I promise I'm fine.

561
00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:21.343
You are our number one priority.

562
00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:24.555
And we just… We need
to make sure that you're okay.

563
00:38:35.023 --> 00:38:36.567
So. it's not over.

564
00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:43.031
No.

565
00:39:03.927 --> 00:39:04.928
Where are you going?

566
00:39:12.936 --> 00:39:16.607
- Do you want me to talk to him?
- Just give him some space.

567
00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:26.158
I don't know if I can ever
look at it the same way again.

568
00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:30.120
It's changed.

569
00:39:32.748 --> 00:39:34.416
It's all changed.

570
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.809
I'll call you back.

571
00:39:54.811 --> 00:39:56.522
- Did you dismantle it?
- Not yet.

572
00:39:56.605 --> 00:39:58.899
But we may have a work-around.

573
00:39:58.982 --> 00:40:00.651
You know about Halidon 241. right?

574
00:40:00.734 --> 00:40:02.236
It's a surveillance project.

575
00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:04.988
Which siphons off SIGINT
traveling along undersea cables.

576
00:40:05.572 --> 00:40:07.574
One of our servers picked up
an encrypted message thread

577
00:40:07.658 --> 00:40:08.742
that we think belongs to him.

578
00:40:08.825 --> 00:40:12.037
- You think?
- He references Archive 6. It's him.

579
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.581
We're in the process of tracking
where that message was sent

580
00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:16.166
and who the recipient was.

581
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.001
Junie. how long will it take?

582
00:40:18.085 --> 00:40:20.963
Give me 12 hours and I'll ID
the coder who built the switch.

583
00:40:24.842 --> 00:40:26.593
I understand you're looking for me.

584
00:40:26.677 --> 00:40:29.137
I am. You're not an easy man to find.

585
00:40:29.221 --> 00:40:30.973
Well. whatever you want. make it fast.

586
00:40:31.056 --> 00:40:34.726
I'm on a disposable SIP
that'll auto-terminate in 90 seconds.

587
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.687
I wanna talk to you about a job.

588
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.605
- I'm not interested.
- You will be.

589
00:40:38.689 --> 00:40:39.857
Why's that?

590
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.234
Well. let's just say you and I
are in the same line of work.

591
00:40:42.317 --> 00:40:44.736
There's a situation unfolding
that you'll be…

592
00:40:45.863 --> 00:40:47.531
very interested in.

593
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:51.660
Well. I found out somehow

594
00:40:51.743 --> 00:40:54.580
One way or another

595
00:40:55.372 --> 00:40:56.582
Oh. no.

596
00:40:58.083 --> 00:41:00.335
He'll start to feel like a brother

597
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:04.089
You learn to listen
Through a long drawl

598
00:41:04.173 --> 00:41:06.592
You soon see past the colors

599
00:41:08.343 --> 00:41:10.846
Can I have everyone's attention. please?

600
00:41:12.222 --> 00:41:13.932
Thank you. thank you very much.

601
00:41:14.016 --> 00:41:16.268
Listen. I won't keep you long.
I'm sorry for interrupting.

602
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:19.188
But. first of all.
I just wanna acknowledge the Mecca bar

603
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:20.606
and Jim for hosting us tonight.

604
00:41:20.689 --> 00:41:23.233
So. thank you. Jim.

605
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.909
Pat has told me that the silent auction
closes in 20 minutes. so get your bids in.

606
00:41:31.992 --> 00:41:34.453
There's a lot of good items up there.
and all the proceeds go to the family.

607
00:41:34.536 --> 00:41:36.371
I still got raffle tickets too!

608
00:41:39.416 --> 00:41:41.502
But from the bottom of my heart.

609
00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:43.879
I really wanted to say thank you
for showing up tonight.

610
00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:46.089
It really means a lot.
It means a lot to all of us.

611
00:41:46.173 --> 00:41:48.175
It's who we are. and it's what we do.

612
00:41:51.386 --> 00:41:54.765
Donnie was like a brother to me.

613
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.226
We first met in the seventh grade.

614
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:59.811
I was nervous and late for class.

615
00:41:59.895 --> 00:42:03.607
so I took a shortcut across the football
field. and the sprinklers kicked on.

616
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.110
And by the time I arrived. I was…
I was soaking wet. Top to tail.

617
00:42:07.194 --> 00:42:11.615
And Donnie. without knowing me one bit.
just gave me the sweatshirt off his back.

618
00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:13.534
It was three sizes too large. but…

619
00:42:14.117 --> 00:42:16.870
But that's the type of guy Donnie was.

620
00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:19.998
And from that day forth.
he always had my back.

621
00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:23.710
We were marshals together
for what seemed a lifetime.

622
00:42:23.794 --> 00:42:26.296
And we made a pact together.

623
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.674
that if anything should happen
to either one of us…

624
00:42:29.925 --> 00:42:34.346
Well. the details don't matter. but the
point is. I promised Donnie three things.

625
00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:39.893
Okay. first of all. I promised that I
would always take care of his wife. Annie.

626
00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:42.271
Second…

627
00:42:45.732 --> 00:42:51.989
I would dance with his little girl the
night she gets married. at the wedding.

628
00:42:52.865 --> 00:42:55.617
And third. that I would celebrate
his life. not only in the church.

629
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:59.997
which we will. but here at the Mecca
with bull fries and Budweiser.

630
00:43:03.917 --> 00:43:05.752
Donnie! Donnie!

631
00:43:05.836 --> 00:43:07.921
There's gonna be plenty of time
for tears and stories.

632
00:43:08.005 --> 00:43:10.132
and to remind ourselves of all
the wonderful things that Donnie

633
00:43:10.215 --> 00:43:12.634
brought into our life. but tonight.

634
00:43:12.718 --> 00:43:17.472
let's all just raise a glass and celebrate
Donnie the way he celebrated life.

635
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:20.684
- To Donnie!
- To Donnie!

636
00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:21.935
We love you. pal!

637
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:30.360
Well. a long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way

638
00:43:34.114 --> 00:43:39.453
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today

639
00:43:40.662 --> 00:43:46.502
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man

640
00:43:49.755 --> 00:43:55.093
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand

641
00:43:58.514 --> 00:44:02.309
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass through this world…

642
00:44:02.392 --> 00:44:04.728
Molly. you have to slow down.

643
00:44:04.811 --> 00:44:06.021
Who is at the house?

644
00:44:06.104 --> 00:44:08.106
The FBI. They're taking everything.

645
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.235
Mom's computer. checkbook. photos.
What do I do?

646
00:44:11.318 --> 00:44:14.613
First off. do not speak to them.
Do not say a word.

647
00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:15.906
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

648
00:44:15.989 --> 00:44:17.241
Mom's scared.

649
00:44:17.324 --> 00:44:19.910
- Mom's there?
- They're talking to her now.

650
00:44:24.915 --> 00:44:27.626
Molly. I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

651
00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.087
I want you to put the phone down. okay?

652
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.923
Don't hang up. just put the receiver down.

653
00:44:33.006 --> 00:44:35.634
Get Mom's things
and take her to your place.

654
00:44:35.717 --> 00:44:38.846
- Why?
- Just set the phone down.

655
00:44:42.474 --> 00:44:45.978
I know this phone is bugged.
I know that you're listening.

656
00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:47.271
and I wanna be very clear.

657
00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:48.939
You have no right to do this.

658
00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:51.817
My family has done nothing.

659
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.026
So. come for me…

660
00:44:55.028 --> 00:44:57.990
tear my life apart.
but you leave them out of this.

661
00:44:58.907 --> 00:45:00.742
They've been through enough.

662
00:45:02.744 --> 00:45:05.998
I think your father went out
for a jog. sweetheart.

663
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.085
No. Mom.

664
00:45:12.379 --> 00:45:13.755
Dad is gone.

665
00:45:14.298 --> 00:45:15.966
Where did he go?

666
00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:21.430
You don't remember.

667
00:45:21.513 --> 00:45:22.723
There was an accident.

668
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:26.935
Right. Oh. gosh.

669
00:45:27.436 --> 00:45:28.729
I'm so sorry.

670
00:45:30.063 --> 00:45:32.065
Why wouldn't I remember that?

671
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:34.902
It's okay.

672
00:45:38.906 --> 00:45:40.407
It was a sad day.

673
00:45:41.366 --> 00:45:44.119
He was so proud of you. honey.

674
00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:48.165
Your dad loved you so much.

675
00:45:51.084 --> 00:45:52.085
Yeah.

676
00:45:52.628 --> 00:45:53.629
He loved you too.

677
00:45:54.671 --> 00:45:55.672
Yeah.

678
00:45:56.256 --> 00:45:58.217
Can you go find Molly?

679
00:45:58.842 --> 00:46:00.385
Molly can help you.

680
00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:03.555
Love you.

681
00:46:04.723 --> 00:46:06.183
I love you.

682
00:46:19.988 --> 00:46:20.989
Sorry.

683
00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:24.660
For what? Protecting your family?

684
00:46:24.743 --> 00:46:27.663
That's something
you never have to apologize for.

685
00:46:33.252 --> 00:46:34.461
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

686
00:46:34.545 --> 00:46:38.924
November 207 engine fire.
Requesting immediate vectors for landing.

687
00:46:39.007 --> 00:46:41.593
We're losing pressure. We gotta get down.

688
00:46:41.677 --> 00:46:44.012
Havlock sent you
the flight deck recording?

689
00:46:44.096 --> 00:46:45.889
- He gave it to Sarah.
- Why would he do that?

690
00:46:45.973 --> 00:46:47.766
He literally stole this
from underneath us.

691
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.892
No note. No message.

692
00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:51.103
Just instructions
to give it to me personally.

693
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:53.438
Hidden in the disco ball
on her fucking key chain.

694
00:46:54.189 --> 00:46:55.816
Well. that makes
my news even more unsettling.

695
00:46:55.899 --> 00:46:56.942
Which is what?

696
00:46:57.025 --> 00:46:59.069
We recovered the hard drive
the Courier brought into the country.

697
00:46:59.152 --> 00:47:00.821
Archive 6. You gave it to OSI--

698
00:47:00.904 --> 00:47:02.614
Yeah. well. they're still
trying to break the encryption.

699
00:47:02.698 --> 00:47:06.368
But from what they can see. forensics
says that the drive isn't state secrets.

700
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:08.161
That it's a series
of navigational prompts.

701
00:47:08.245 --> 00:47:10.414
Like the sort they use in avionics.

702
00:47:10.497 --> 00:47:12.124
- On an airplane.
- Yeah.

703
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:15.878
Today. on the call. Havlock acted
like he was trying to protect you.

704
00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.504
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

705
00:47:17.588 --> 00:47:19.089
He's just playing games.

706
00:47:21.216 --> 00:47:22.634
All right. That's what I thought.

707
00:47:23.135 --> 00:47:25.846
But I mean. you'd tell me. you know. if…
if it wasn't just a game?

708
00:47:25.929 --> 00:47:29.600
Look. the Courier arrived 24 hours
before the plane went down. Why?

709
00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:32.686
It was our transport and even we
didn't know where it was routed.

710
00:47:33.187 --> 00:47:36.064
The only people who knew that plane
was coming through Alaska were--

711
00:47:36.148 --> 00:47:38.233
- Were the CIA.
- So. what if we've got it wrong. Hutch?

712
00:47:38.317 --> 00:47:41.486
What if the Courier doesn't work
for Havlock. but he works for the CIA?

713
00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.822
And what if that hard drive
is not Archive 6.

714
00:47:43.906 --> 00:47:45.616
but malware to bring the plane down.

715
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:49.411
Are you saying the CIA brought down
the airliner to kill Havlock?

716
00:47:49.494 --> 00:47:51.705
I'm saying it's not an accident.

717
00:47:52.414 --> 00:47:53.749
What about Scofield?
You think she's involved?

718
00:47:53.832 --> 00:47:56.210
I don't know. That's why
it stays between you and me.

719
00:47:56.919 --> 00:47:58.879
Yeah. well.
I think you need to talk to your wife.

720
00:47:58.962 --> 00:47:59.963
Yeah. I do.

721
00:48:00.047 --> 00:48:01.965
Hey. you and me need to sit down

722
00:48:02.049 --> 00:48:03.967
and figure out what the fuck
is going on here. okay?

723
00:48:04.051 --> 00:48:05.511
- Yeah.
- All right.

724
00:48:08.847 --> 00:48:10.015
- Hey.
- Hey.

725
00:48:10.098 --> 00:48:13.143
You can work at work. right?
We're here to support Annie.

726
00:48:13.227 --> 00:48:14.561
Yeah. What. you think I don't know that?

727
00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:16.647
I just got 15 things going on here.

728
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:19.107
Well. there's only one of those
that I actually care about.

729
00:48:19.191 --> 00:48:20.984
I care about us and our family.

730
00:48:21.068 --> 00:48:23.487
I know you have a job to do. but…

731
00:48:25.614 --> 00:48:26.907
you also have a choice to make.

732
00:48:27.491 --> 00:48:29.535
What does that mean? No. no.
What does that mean?

733
00:48:29.618 --> 00:48:30.619
"A choice to make."

734
00:48:30.702 --> 00:48:34.248
Hey. you two. They're playing
Donnie's song. Come on.

735
00:48:34.331 --> 00:48:37.167
- I'm not dancing.
- We can't not dance. Let's go.

736
00:48:40.379 --> 00:48:46.218
Nothing around but the sound
Of my heart and your sighs

737
00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:52.599
Money talks

738
00:48:53.892 --> 00:48:57.688
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk

739
00:48:59.147 --> 00:49:03.360
And long as I can have you
Here with me

740
00:49:03.443 --> 00:49:07.948
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans. babe

741
00:49:11.493 --> 00:49:13.453
And honey's sweet

742
00:49:13.537 --> 00:49:16.039
- What choice?
- Huh?

743
00:49:16.832 --> 00:49:18.917
You said I had a choice to make.

744
00:49:20.544 --> 00:49:24.464
Yeah. Your work or your family.

745
00:49:24.548 --> 00:49:27.467
We'd do okay
Forever in blue jeans

746
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:28.552
Frank.

747
00:49:29.178 --> 00:49:30.387
Not now.

748
00:49:30.971 --> 00:49:33.765
Sorry. It can't wait. This is urgent.

749
00:49:36.852 --> 00:49:42.316
Maybe tonight by the fire
All alone. you and I

750
00:49:46.028 --> 00:49:52.034
Nothing around but the sound
Of my heart and your sighs

751
00:49:55.954 --> 00:49:57.956
Frank. I think we're onto something.

752
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.918
I've sifted through hours
of Romero's online videos

753
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:03.795
and found one where he
specifically talks about HAARP.

754
00:50:03.879 --> 00:50:06.048
Evidently. there's a switch
that tells the facility

755
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:07.966
to go to battery backup in an emergency.

756
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.011
Romero claims that switch
represents a flaw in the system.

757
00:50:11.094 --> 00:50:14.515
If the switch isn't in place when
the facility is brought back online.

758
00:50:14.598 --> 00:50:16.683
power from the primary
and the battery backup

759
00:50:16.767 --> 00:50:18.227
will both be fed through the network.

760
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:23.398
If that switch isn't there
when HAARP comes back online.

761
00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:25.359
our entire power grid may collapse.

762
00:50:25.984 --> 00:50:27.819
All right. Call the General.
Tell him it's a trap.

763
00:50:27.903 --> 00:50:29.488
Tell him not to power up.

764
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:31.323
- All right?
- Got it.
