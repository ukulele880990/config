﻿1
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.508
Okay. turn left up here.

2
00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.052
And can you step on the gas a little?

3
00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:16.808
Off the gas. Off the gas.

4
00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.310
Does somebody else
wanna drive here?

5
00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:20.479
Phoebe. the demon is not
waiting around for us

6
00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:21.897
to come and vanquish him.

7
00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.316
We don't even know if we have
the power to vanquish him.

8
00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.276
Scrying for random evil
tells us nothing.

9
00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:27.945
It tells us where the demons are.

10
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.863
and since we vanquished
two already this week.

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.615
- I'd say it's working pretty well.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.450
Thanks to Cole
for saving our butts.

13
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.246
Two witches and a half a demon
does not the power of three make.

14
00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.747
So. what are we supposed to do?

15
00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.916
Sit around and wait for them
to pick us all off?

16
00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.418
If we weren't going after them.
they'd be coming after us.

17
00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.128
They're coming after you
anyway. Piper.

18
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.965
- The Source is coming after you.
- And we won't be ready for him

19
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.592
because instead of teaching Paige
how to be a witch.

20
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:55.681
we are out hunting for every Tom.
Dick and Beelzebub in San Francisco.

21
00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.391
Speaking of.
do we have a plan. or--?

22
00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.184
- The plan is vanquish the demon.
- Great.

23
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.186
Have you mastered your powers.
or are you still freezing

24
00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:02.646
- and exploding at random?
- Random.

25
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:05.232
But you know what they say.
there's nothing like field practice.

26
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.608

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.369
Stop.

29
00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:22.791
Hey. Big. scary demon.

30
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.382
He's gonna blow.

31
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.225
Next?

32
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.729

33
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.356

37
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.531
Paige.

38
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.324
Yeah?

39
00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.745
What's the holdup
on the O'Brien application?

40
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.791
Well. at the moment. the only holdup
is my boss. who's standing over me.

41
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.168
distracting me from my work.

42
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.671
Nice teeth.

43
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.506
Have it on my desk by noon.

44
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.260
Lila.

45
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.011
What's the O'Brien application?

46
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.306
Adam O'Brien? The foster kid we're
trying to get into the boarding school?

47
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.350
Oh. my God.

48
00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.436
The scholarship application
is due. like. today.

49
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.272
I'm so lame.

50
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.695
Oh. Billy. I thought I told you to throw
anything from creditors in the trash.

51
00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.614
Hi. pizza-face.

52
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:03.744
Look. I understand how difficult
it is to tear yourself away

53
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.495
from the cleavage in this section.

54
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:09.249
but I'm gonna need my mail
sometime today. okay?

55
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.667
No problem.

56
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.961
Go. go.

57
00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.427
Nice rug.

58
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.391
What the hell?

59
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.603
Look at him.
What happened to his hair?

60
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.272
I didn't know he was bald!

61
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.363
Oh. I know that you're happy
that we got him. Piper.

62
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.325
but is it entirely necessary
to disfigure the <i>Book?</i>

63
00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:46.661
This one could incinerate
human flesh with his eyes.

64
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.872
That must sting.

65
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.457
You think that's funny?

66
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.504
You could've gotten yourself killed.
Do you understand that?

67
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.923
Yes. Cole. I understand "killed"
very well.

68
00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.383
Then why would you wanna keep
risking your life and Phoebe's?

69
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.802
Not to mention mine.

70
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.845
There's a legion of bounty hunters
on my ass.

71
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.182
I'm supposed to be laying low. but
instead I'm out protecting you guys.

72
00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.393
You know what. Cole?
Next time you can stay home.

73
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.855
If you insist on taking these suicide
missions. you force me to be there.

74
00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.942
because there's no way in hell I'm
gonna let Phoebe lose another sister.

75
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.569
Why don't you go see
who's at the door for us. okay?

76
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.112
Sure.

77
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.449
If it's The Source.
I'll just ask him to come back later.

78
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.493
We need to talk.

79
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.501
Piper. Cole's right. We have
a system for fighting demons.

80
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.545
and it's worked pretty well
the last three years.

81
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:41.716
I think Prue being killed counts
as a pretty big glitch in the system.

82
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.344
I know that you're angry.
I am angry too.

83
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.137
Then why are you fighting me
on this?

84
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.057
What's--? What is the problem
with getting a little proactive?

85
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.852
Because we're not ready
to get proactive.

86
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.603
That's what's wrong with it.

87
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.689
We're barely ready for anything
right now.

88
00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:59.609
Just dealing with our everyday
normal lives is hard enough.

89
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.319
That is precisely the point.

90
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.988
The faster we get rid
of these demons.

91
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.240
the faster we can get back
to our everyday normal lives.

92
00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.908
or at least what is left of them.

93
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.035
Knock-knock.

94
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.664
I--

95
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.458
I'm sorry to just drop by
without calling.

96
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.294
It's okay. don't worry about it.

97
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.507
I don't know exactly why I'm here.
I'm just kind of having a hard time

98
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.010
being surrounded by people. and--

99
00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.096
And not be able to tell them that you
can move things with your mind?

100
00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.350
It does not exactly
roll off the tongue.

101
00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.103
Yeah. Well. being a witch
is tough on friendships.

102
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.272
That's why the whole sister thing
comes in so handy.

103
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.857
What are you doing?

104
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:44.112
It's a little chatty up here. so I'm
gonna go scry for evil in my room.

105
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.197
Scry?

106
00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.741
Yeah.

107
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.160
Phoebe will explain.

108
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:52.037
I'll see you later.

109
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.586
It's kind of like
a supernatural LoJack.

110
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.839
Well. why don't you just use
that big book?

111
00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:06.176
I mean. it is a book of spells. right?

112
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.011
Oh. it's a lot more than that.

113
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.639
It's kind of hard to explain.

114
00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:13.975
It looks so old.

115
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:17.145
Yeah. It has survived a lot.

116
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.231
Fortunately. it protects
itself from evil.

117
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.525
It protects itself? How?

118
00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.194
Magic.

119
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:27.906
May I?

120
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:32.035
Yeah. Technically. it's yours too.

121
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.871
I would walk you through it
right now.

122
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.873
but I have to go talk to Cole.

123
00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.542
Well. maybe I can just
take it back to my office.

124
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.711
Oh. no. no. No.

125
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.338
It doesn't leave the house.

126
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.382
But just feel free
to thumb through it.

127
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.801
And then I'll be back
in a few minutes.

128
00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.938
This could solve a lot of problems.

129
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.118
- What? What is it? What's wrong?
- You've got to talk to your wife.

130
00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.537
Okay. Cole. Remember what I said
about being gentle?

131
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.581
- What about my wife?
- She's out of control.

132
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.083
Cole.

133
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.626
What?

134
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.129
It's just we're very worried
about her.

135
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.839
What happened?

136
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.340
She's very. very angry.

137
00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.467
Well. of course she's angry.
She's grieving.

138
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.302
Right. And if she were
punching walls.

139
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.971
I would happily call a repairman.

140
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.140
The problem is she prefers
to punch demons.

141
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.853
- Well. I'll talk to her.
- She has no regard for her own life.

142
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.355
Or anyone else's.
She's Charles Bronson. cubed.

143
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.441
I said I'd talk to her.

144
00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.818
Guys. Guys.

145
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.446
Who is Charles Bronson?

146
00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.868
Never mind. We--

147
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.911
Can we please just have
a minute alone?

148
00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.373
- Sure.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:08.006
It's not just that she's violent. Leo.
she's acting nothing like herself.

150
00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:12.052
She's completely
dismissive of Paige. and...

151
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.971
I don't know what to do anymore.

152
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.307
Strange. isn't it?

153
00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.769
Now on top of everything else.
you have to play the middle sister.

154
00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:23.146
When you've always been the...

155
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.898
Screwup?

156
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.275
The youngest.

157
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.819
Yeah. I look at Paige and Piper.

158
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.905
and it makes me think back
to all those times

159
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.200
that Piper had to play mediator
between me and Prue.

160
00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:37.452
Not a lot of fun. huh?

161
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.996
It's not a job I would've asked for.

162
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:45.043
And I'm not sure it's a job
I'm gonna be any good at. but...

163
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.005
I just-- I don't have time
to really worry about it right now.

164
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.008
I'll talk to her.

165
00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.636
Thanks. Leo.

166
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.431
Not to rush this tender moment.
but she's already started scrying.

167
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.480
I didn't mean
you couldn't use the stairs.

168
00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.834
Okay. book. Protect yourself.

169
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.512
Paige? I'll be right up.

170
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.142
- Where's the fire?
- Oh. you know. work.

171
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.060
Lunch break's over. Gotta go.

172
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.812
But we didn't even get to talk.

173
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.939
Oh. yeah. It's all right. Don't worry.

174
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.482
Will you come by later?

175
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.484
Sure. Yeah. absolutely.

176
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.236
Bye.

177
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.073
Bye.

178
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.620
Look. honey...

179
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.373
...it isn't just that it's dangerous.

180
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.626
Leo. whitelighters are supposed
to guide. not judge.

181
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.837
Just because I'm doing things
a little bit differently

182
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.589
doesn't mean
that there is a problem.

183
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.340
Piper. I'm your husband...

184
00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.758
...not just your whitelighter.

185
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.428
And when you speak to me like that.
there is a problem.

186
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.514
I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

187
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.435
It hurts to talk. Leo.

188
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.979
It hurts to breathe.

189
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.066
So unless you have some idea
of how to bring Prue back.

190
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.152
I don't wanna talk right now.

191
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.406
Is that what you don't wanna say?

192
00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.075
Is that you still blame me
for not being able to bring her back?

193
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:44.037
No. Leo. I don't blame you.

194
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.413
I blame evil.

195
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.249
Why--? Why do you think
I am doing all of this?

196
00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.918
- For kicks?
- Honestly?

197
00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.711
I think you're doing it
because it's easier

198
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.671
than confronting
what you're really feeling.

199
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.639
- Demon.
- What?

200
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.098
I have work to do.

201
00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.853
Cole. Phoebe. let's go.

202
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:21.407
Nothing like a copy room
with a view.

203
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.537
Hey. Clearasil.

204
00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:28.456
What's popping?

205
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.296
Don't worry about him. Billy.
He's a jerk to everybody.

206
00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.881
Yeah. I know.

207
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.967
That's why his mail gets lost.

208
00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.843
Frequently.

209
00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.889
Hey. is there something wrong
with this copier?

210
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.891
The copier? I don't think so.

211
00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.726
I just ran off a whole bunch.

212
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.728
Everything keeps coming up blank.

213
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.982
Are you trying to copy a book?

214
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.276
No. It's nothing. It's cool.

215
00:12:56.442 --> 00:13:00.071
Well. if you need me to do it for you.
just say the word.

216
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.906
Thanks. You're sweet.

217
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.008
<i>Let the object of objection
Become but a dream</i>

218
00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:23.052
<i>As I cause the seen
To be unseen</i>

219
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.308
- You okay. Billy?
- Yeah.

220
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.644
I just-- I got a little head rush.

221
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.277
Oh. my God. It worked.

222
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.366
Oh. my God.

223
00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.371
Paige? Is everything okay?

224
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.291
It will be from now on.

225
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.759
Piper. Cole and I do not
support you in this.

226
00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.219
If you insist on doing it.
you're going in alone.

227
00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.971
Okay. I'll see you at home.

228
00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:08.348
I told you that wouldn't work.

229
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.141
- It was worth a shot.
- Wait a minute.

230
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.226
Do you smell smoke?

231
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:14.812
It's in there.

232
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.235
Stop. Stop. No--

233
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.369
Get back. I'll blow it up.

234
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.787
Go on.

235
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.502
- Piper?
- Yeah. yeah.

236
00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:39.003
Crap.

237
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.631
Okay.

238
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.721
Piper.

239
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.515
- What?
- Cole.

240
00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.943
Piper. let them go.

241
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.581
They're-- They're immune
to my powers.

242
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.708
Unfortunately. Cole isn't.

243
00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.179
- Piper. unfreeze him.
- What if I blow him up?

244
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.604
Cole.

245
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.542
I'm gonna take out those
chain-smoking bitches

246
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.627
if it's the last thing I do.

247
00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.629
It might be the last thing you do.

248
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.632
That's very supportive. Cole.
Whose side are you on?

249
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.301
At the moment.
I'm on Phoebe's side.

250
00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.929
Well. the last time I checked.
Phoebe was still my sister.

251
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.681
which technically puts her
on my side.

252
00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.558
- Why are we arguing?
- We're not arguing.

253
00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.935
We're discussing. Piper.
You are arguing.

254
00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.313
- And look. you're already hurt.
- I'm fine.

255
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.815
- You can't stop coughing.
- And your control over your powers

256
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.400
seems to be getting worse.
not better.

257
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.819
Well. our powers
are tied to our emotions.

258
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.655
so it makes sense that they
would be a little off right now.

259
00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:33.159
All the more reason to lay low.
These demons are dangerous.

260
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.828
All the more reason
to vanquish them. okay?

261
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.955
That is what we do. Eliminate evil.

262
00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.416
Regardless of the consequences.
Now you sound like Prue.

263
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.629
Okay. Cole. I'm going to vanquish
the cancer girls

264
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.005
with or without your help.

265
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.508
So either tell me what you know.
or get out of the way.

266
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.514
They're called Furies.

267
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.850
- Like from mythology?
- The dog-faced women from hell?

268
00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.561
They're modern knockoffs.
Their m.o. is the same. though.

269
00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.647
- They punish evildoers?
- Exactly.

270
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.190
Wait. Wouldn't that
make them good?

271
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.733
Well. these Furies
have no temperance.

272
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.860
They'll go after a shoplifter
as soon as a murderer.

273
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.987
and they take
great pleasure in the kill.

274
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:13.157
Great. Then we'll take
great pleasure in the vanquish.

275
00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.374
What aren't you telling us?

276
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.962
So they go after evildoers.
Have they attacked you before?

277
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.466
When they focus
their thoughts on you.

278
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.135
they force you to hear the cries
of all your former victims.

279
00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:37.014
You're not the demon
who did those things anymore.

280
00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.653
Evil got the <i>Book of Shadows.</i>

281
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.196
How did evil
get the <i>Book of Shadows?</i>

282
00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.365
- Oh. no.
- Oh. no. Phoebe?

283
00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.992
A demon has
the <i>Book of Shadows.</i>

284
00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.618
"Oh. no" doesn't quite cover it.

285
00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.121
- Let me go see what I can find out.
- No. wait.

286
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.789
Piper?

287
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.708
Promise me you're not
gonna overreact.

288
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.918
Is that even possible?

289
00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:09.422
I think that maybe...

290
00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:13.926
Well. it might--
Might be feasible that...

291
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.763
...Paige borrowed the <i>Book</i>.

292
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.475
What? Why--? Why--?

293
00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:23.436
Why would you think that?

294
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.188
See. now. this is what I meant
about overreacting.

295
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.065
- It's just that i--
- You let Paige

296
00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.775
take the <i>Book of Shadows</i>
out of the manor?

297
00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:33.487
Well. no. I did not let her.
It's just. she left pretty quick...

298
00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:39.285
- ...and it looks like she might have--
- Out of the window?

299
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:40.995
- Piper. I am--
- Phoebe. why would you

300
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.830
even leave her alone with it?

301
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.041
Well. because she's our sister.

302
00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:47.918
Not for long.

303
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.641
- Are you coming?
- To vanquish your sister?

304
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.559
I think I'll sit this one out.

305
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.401
It's unbelievable.

306
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.403
Maybe it was the light
from the copy machine.

307
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.113
God. this day is amazing.

308
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.532
- I mean. you went and got cute.
- You think?

309
00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:22.119
Totally. And then my car loan comes
through. like. out of nowhere.

310
00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:24.121
My credit is worse than Paige's.

311
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:27.500
- You know. I still can't believe all this.
- This is amazing.

312
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.795
Sir. I am taking full responsibility
for being late with the application.

313
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:33.089
I'm simply asking
for a deadline extension.

314
00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.590
<i>Well. I can't give you a deadline--</i>

315
00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.842
Well. I'm asking that you
not punish Adam O'Brien.

316
00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.011
who's already had
a tough enough life. for my mistake.

317
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.222
<i>Someone has to straighten
this thing out.</i>

318
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:42.598
Sir. all I'm saying is--

319
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.103
<i>These words will travel
Through the minds</i>

320
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.646
<i>Of stubborn parties and unbind</i>

321
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:52.233
<i>The thoughts too rigid to be kind
A compromise they'll disentwine</i>

322
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.860
<i>How does 6:00 on Friday sound?</i>

323
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.154
Six o'clock Friday is perfect.

324
00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:59.407
Thank you so much.

325
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.118
- Victory.
- You got the extension?

326
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.578
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable.

327
00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.288
You're into all that
witchy stuff. right?

328
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.208
- Excuse me?
- Well. I'm just thinking

329
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.168
that there must be something
in the stars today.

330
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.713
I mean. Billy's face.
my car. now this.

331
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.965
Is there a full moon or something?

332
00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.551
I don't know. but whatever it is.

333
00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.262
I'm gonna call my student-loan sharks
and take full advantage of it.

334
00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.806
Oh. good. Me too.

335
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.979
You know. Paige. as a lawyer.

336
00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:34.316
I could get those nasty creditors
off your back so easily.

337
00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.610
And if you can't afford to pay me.

338
00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:39.780
I could always
just take it out in trade.

339
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:42.199
Or I could just sue your ass
for sexual harassment.

340
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.494
And pay you with my big fat
punitive settlement.

341
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.580
The way you dress?

342
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.040
The judge would admire
my restraint.

343
00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.419
That's it.

344
00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.593
Perfect. I'll just change "demon"
to "dirtbag."

345
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.638
I don't understand
how someone can be that stupid.

346
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.849
I don't understand why
you haven't stopped ranting

347
00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.225
since we left the house.

348
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.478
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

349
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:13.105
- Yes. Paige made a mistake.
- A mistake?

350
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.733
- She stole from us.
- She borrowed. Borrowed.

351
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.279
She-- She threw our family heritage
out of the window.

352
00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:24.533
Well. that's because we never took
the time to explain its significance.

353
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.951
It was just a book to her.

354
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.787
Okay. Phoebe. it is not just a book.

355
00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:31.916
It's like-- It is like part of our family.

356
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.504
Paige is not a killer.
She didn't kill anyone.

357
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.798
And she's not a demon
that we're on our way to vanquish.

358
00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.216
- I get that. Phoebe.
- Do you?

359
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.134
Because I don't think that you do.

360
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.594
- You all right--?
- Hey.

361
00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:45.846
Get away from me. Hey.

362
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.934
- What the hell is going on?
- This is not funny.

363
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.270
Oh. Donnie. Give mama some sugar.

364
00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:57.399
Who's the man? You are.

365
00:21:57.817 --> 00:22:00.528
You are so...

366
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.115
...busted?

367
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.201
Hello.

368
00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.620
You stole our sacred book

369
00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:12.790
so you could perform magical
plastic surgery on yourself?

370
00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.166
You think I did this on purpose?

371
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.836
My body was perfectly fine
just as it was. thank you.

372
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.505
I mean it. Get away from me!

373
00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:25.427
Piper. you could've just blown up
a dozen innocent people.

374
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:28.180
- I took a chance.
- See? Are you listening to yourself?

375
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:31.767
- What happened?
- I don't know. They just grew.

376
00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.603
Oh. right. And you had
nothing to do with that.

377
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.564
Did you cast any spells?

378
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.650
One.

379
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.319
- Five.
- Five?

380
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:46.532
Okay. what did you do just before
you turned into Betty Boop?

381
00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.286
Well. I cast a spell on the slimeball
I work with

382
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.830
so I could give him a taste
of his own medicine.

383
00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:54.665
That the slimeball?

384
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.837
And that's the backfire.

385
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.423
- Backfire?
- You misused magic

386
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.633
to make him the object of ogling.

387
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.760
and the spell backfired
and did the same thing to you.

388
00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.096
Which you would've learned
if you had bothered to ask.

389
00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:11.056
but now. instead
of vanquishing demons.

390
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.475
we're gonna have to spend
the afternoon fixing your mess.

391
00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:19.857
Okay. Piper. call Leo and get him
to orb this slimeball back home.

392
00:23:20.024 --> 00:23:22.985
We have to protect him until we can
figure out a way to reverse the spell.

393
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:25.237
Paige and I will grab the <i>Book</i>
and meet you there.

394
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:38.250
Are my boobs gonna stay
this way forever?

395
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:40.794
Not if I can ever find the spell.

396
00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:42.588
What about Piper?

397
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:44.381
She gonna stay mad at me forever?

398
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.927
No. It's just...

399
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.262
...she hasn't really
been herself lately.

400
00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:53.265
You know. a lot of ups and downs...

401
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.226
...since Prue...
You know? Like us all.

402
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:58.729
The last thing I wanted to do
was add to your guys' stress.

403
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:01.774
I just wanted to get back at Donnie.

404
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:04.693
Yeah. and I understand
the temptation. Paige. I really do.

405
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.154
But I told you. the <i>Book</i>
does not leave the house.

406
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:09.406
Right. Sorry.

407
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:13.035
My boobs are in the way.

408
00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:15.412
Can you put it into third for me?

409
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:18.207
All right. Ready? Here we go.

410
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:20.751
All right.

411
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.336
Did you find the spell yet?

412
00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:25.839
No. but I found the demons.

413
00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.633
- Oh. my God.
- What?

414
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.219
You can't say "demons" followed
by "Oh. my God." I'm new at this.

415
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:33.180
- I'm likely to panic.
- Okay.

416
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:35.432
Fury smoke kills bad guys. right?

417
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:39.853
But in good people. it looks
for a portal of unexpressed fury.

418
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.107
- And?
- It builds until it consumes

419
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:46.527
your humanity.
and it turns you into a Fury.

420
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:48.570
We fought the Furies today.

421
00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:50.364
Piper got smoked.

422
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.701
Wait. Are you saying
that Piper is turning into a demon?

423
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.078
It wouldn't be the first time.

424
00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.331
Step on it and hit the clutch.
I'm going into fourth. Ready?

425
00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.458
On three. One. two. three.

426
00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:07.047
Easy. Piper.

427
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.882
What. are you protecting him now?

428
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.592
What the hell's going on?

429
00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:12.761
And what's with the chicks?
They've gone crazy.

430
00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:16.598
This chick just saved your ass.
you sniveling ingrate.

431
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.061
- Do you see what I mean?
- Who said you could get up?

432
00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:26.358
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh. my God.

433
00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.485
Okay. honey. look.
I don't know what's going on.

434
00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:30.070
but we really need to talk.

435
00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.865
Leo. you know what?

436
00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:34.575
I'm sick of talking.

437
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:41.457
Now we really need to talk.

438
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:45.711
Piper. you do not use your powers
on a mortal. do you hear me?

439
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.589
Back away slowly. Leo.

440
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:51.133
What?

441
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.344
She's becoming a Fury.

442
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.973
There's no reasoning with her now.

443
00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:02.728
Piper. you're a good witch.
Do you hear me? Fight this.

444
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:12.946
Oh. God. help.

445
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.991
No!

446
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.331
Cole.

447
00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:25.000
I-- Well...

448
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.129
That wasn't very nice.

449
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:42.059
Cole hit her with an energy ball.

450
00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:43.852
Leo. it was low voltage.

451
00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.813
Would you prefer
he'd let her kill an innocent?

452
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:48.774
I'd prefer that he wouldn't use
his demonic powers on my wife.

453
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.193
I can't believe that you let him
go look for her.

454
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.655
This is all my fault. I shouldn't have
stolen the <i>Book of Shadows</i>.

455
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.323
- You stole the <i>Book of Shadows?</i>
- Leo.

456
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.700
Leo. concentrate. please.

457
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.327
I just hope he finds her fast.

458
00:27:00.494 --> 00:27:03.288
because if this is anything
like the time I turned into a banshee.

459
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.125
- she's gonna be hungry for a kill.
- I'm sorry. A banshee?

460
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.294
Yeah. a demonic screamer.
Kind of trampy. feeds on pain.

461
00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:12.089
I think I need to sit down.

462
00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:22.599
- Paige.
- What?

463
00:27:22.766 --> 00:27:24.560
You only said I couldn't use magic
to punish him.

464
00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:26.270
Okay. Leo.

465
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:28.480
You orb Donnie back to his office.

466
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:31.608
Heal him there. then make sure he
doesn't narc us out for being witches.

467
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:33.902
- How?
- I don't know. Be creative.

468
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:35.445
What about Piper?

469
00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:38.407
You have to do your job.
and let us do ours.

470
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.577
We'll get your wife back.
I promise.

471
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:54.173
I hate to ask. but how are we
going to get his wife back?

472
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.842
I mean. she's kind of
a full-on demon.

473
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.595
No. she's not full-on.
She doesn't have the talons yet.

474
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:01.763
That probably comes
with the first kill.

475
00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:06.226
Besides. if we were able to save her
when she turned into a Wendigo...

476
00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:07.769
A Wendi-what?

477
00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:09.897
A Wendigo.

478
00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:14.359
It's kind of like a werewolf.
only meaner.

479
00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:18.530
Is this the spell that you used?

480
00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.869
Is there some sort of spell I could do.
you know. in advance

481
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:26.788
so I could not become.
maybe. a banshee or--

482
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:28.540
What word did you
sub "demon" with?

483
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.292
"Dirtbag."

484
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:33.462
"Dirtbag."

485
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:42.262
Okay.

486
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.932
Hand.

487
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.394
<i>Guided spirits. hear our plea</i>

488
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:53.649
<i>Annul this magic. let it be</i>

489
00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:55.359
Please let it be.

490
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.410
Do you think it worked
a little too well?

491
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.500
- Leave me--
- Shut up!

492
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.328
I've been looking for you.

493
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:55.544
- Damn it.
- Why isn't it working?

494
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:57.462
Because Piper isn't a witch anymore.

495
00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.548
Well. can't you just
scry for evil then?

496
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:03.969
Do you have any idea how much evil
is running around San Francisco?

497
00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:07.306
Damn it. Piper.

498
00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.602
Cole. Thank God.

499
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:15.230
- Don't thank him yet.
- You didn't find her?

500
00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:17.899
I didn't get a chance to look.
Every time I used my sensing powers.

501
00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:22.279
a bounty hunter sensed me.
I fought off three of them.

502
00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:25.240
- I'm sorry.
- No. it's-- It's okay.

503
00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:28.201
Somehow everything's
gonna be okay.

504
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:33.915
I don't have even a little idea
how everything's gonna be okay.

505
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:35.625
- Phoebe.
- You know why? Because nothing

506
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.210
- is okay.
- Phoebe?

507
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:39.755
My sister is a Fury.
my boyfriend is a demon--

508
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.631
- Oh. baby. You're bleeding.
- Phoebe.

509
00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:47.179
Didn't you say you found me because
Piper cast a spell to find a lost witch?

510
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:51.558
Yes. but I also said
that Piper's not a witch anymore.

511
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:55.228
Yes. but if I could substitute
the word "dirtbag" for "demon."

512
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.522
why can't we substitute
the word "sister" for "witch"?

513
00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:59.274
Would that work?

514
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:03.695
Well. no. Not if she's
already looking for a kill.

515
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.614
- The call won't be strong enough.
- Why not?

516
00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:07.199
Because of the pull of evil.

517
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.701
When I was possessed
by the Woogie.

518
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.828
- the blood lust was so strong.
- Woogie?

519
00:31:11.995 --> 00:31:15.082
- Don't ask.
- The point is...

520
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:16.875
...I don't think she'll answer the call.

521
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.048
Then we'll add bait.

522
00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:32.432
No. No. are you kidding me? No.

523
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:34.476
The Furies go after evildoers. right?

524
00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:39.439
Paige. we are not using
the love of my life as bait.

525
00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:42.109
Yes. we are. It's perfect.

526
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:45.695
Cole. you have been a demon
for over a century.

527
00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:49.699
That is a lot of victims. The pain
of their cries alone can kill you.

528
00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:52.244
But as you said. I'm not the demon
who did those things anymore.

529
00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:55.664
And if facing my crimes
helps save your sister--

530
00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:57.499
- Cole. i--
- Phoebe...

531
00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:05.382
I would do almost anything
for you. you know that.

532
00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:09.052
But I will not be a coward for you.
Please don't ask me to be.

533
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.437
We'll need some of your blood.

534
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:20.439
Right.

535
00:32:21.898 --> 00:32:23.108
Knife.

536
00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:32.784
<i>- Power of the sisters rise
- Power of the sisters rise</i>

537
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:35.495
<i>- Course unseen across the skies
- Course unseen across the skies</i>

538
00:32:35.662 --> 00:32:37.998
<i>- Come to us who call you near
- Come to us who call you near</i>

539
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:40.375
<i>- Come to us and settle here
- Come to us and settle here</i>

540
00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:42.919
<i>- Blood to blood. I summon thee
- Blood to blood. I summon thee</i>

541
00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:45.922
<i>- Blood to blood. return to me
- Blood to blood. return to me</i>

542
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:53.263
I know where evil dwells.

543
00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:00.187
You sure about this?

544
00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:03.273
I'm good at a lot of things.
Waiting is not one of them.

545
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:08.153
Honey. what are you doing?

546
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.779
I'm trying to do that orb thingy.

547
00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.781
I can't seem to get
the hang of it. though.

548
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.371
- What happened?
- You orbed.

549
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.749
- I did?
- It's a fear response.

550
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:23.418
So until you learn how to control it.
you just have to--

551
00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.712
- Get scared?
- Pretty much.

552
00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:28.423
All right.

553
00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:30.967
- Well. that shouldn't be too difficult.
- Good.

554
00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:33.011
Then we will orb. we will levitate.

555
00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:34.846
we will juggle knives if we have to.

556
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:36.765
just to keep the Furies
distracted from Cole.

557
00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:40.185
Okay. but what I don't get is how we
un-demon Piper once she gets here.

558
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.146
Well. we have to close the portal
of unexpressed fury.

559
00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:46.066
Unexpressed? I think
she's been raging for days.

560
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:48.109
That's because there's something
she's not saying.

561
00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:50.779
- Which is?
- I don't know.

562
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:52.364
But I think I have an idea.

563
00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.704
They're close.

564
00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:03.500
Paige.

565
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:06.878
I did it again.

566
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.381
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

567
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:21.184
Phoebe.

568
00:34:23.186 --> 00:34:25.730
Nice decoy. Piper. Two points.

569
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.322
Cole.

570
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.949
Cole.

571
00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:37.784
Come on.

572
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:41.079
Lamp.

573
00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:45.834
Sorry.

574
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:48.712
Really sorry.

575
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:01.891
Cole is not your problem. Piper.
and you know it.

576
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:10.942
Book.

577
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.238
Please let there be
something in here.

578
00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:19.034
Cole. don't.

579
00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:22.162
You think I abandoned you.

580
00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.206
You think it's my fault that Prue died.

581
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.125
You blame me.
So just admit it.

582
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:34.382
You don't wanna kill me. Piper.
You don't even know me.

583
00:35:34.758 --> 00:35:35.884
You okay?

584
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:37.636
It's not about me.
It's not about Phoebe. is it?

585
00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.012
Leo.

586
00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:47.979
Phoebe's not the sister
who abandoned you.

587
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:50.440
- It's Prue.
- Leo. do something.

588
00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:58.073
Where did he take them?

589
00:35:58.323 --> 00:36:00.867
To what Piper's really angry at.

590
00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:15.382
Tell her. Piper.
It's all right to hate her.

591
00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.637
You should hate her.

592
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:24.349
When my parents died.
I hated them for it.

593
00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:27.018
I was alone. and I hated them.

594
00:36:28.144 --> 00:36:30.397
It is okay to hate Prue.

595
00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:38.363
How dare you!

596
00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:41.324
How dare you leave me?

597
00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.994
How could you go and die
and leave me here all alone?

598
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:47.914
Please come back.

599
00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:51.918
I need you. Please come back.

600
00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:06.141
It's okay. It's okay. honey.

601
00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:08.268
It's not okay.

602
00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:11.604
She risked her life every day.

603
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:13.481
She never thought about
what would happen

604
00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:15.859
to me and Phoebe
if she was gone.

605
00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:17.277
I know.

606
00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:22.115
How could she think
that I could live without her?

607
00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:52.937
Did you sleep?

608
00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:57.317
Yeah. Actually. better than I have
in a while.

609
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:00.945
It's quiet. isn't it?

610
00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:03.281
Early and late.

611
00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:06.785
It's just really. really quiet.

612
00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.246
Prue was always the first one up.

613
00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:12.749
and the last one down.

614
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:16.753
It's strange. the things that you miss.

615
00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:21.382
So...

616
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:23.718
...how scary was I?

617
00:38:25.678 --> 00:38:27.680
Heck. I've seen worse.

618
00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:29.557
I've been worse.

619
00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:31.768
But...

620
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.354
...about Paige.

621
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:39.025
- She completely freaked.
- No. She handled it.

622
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.110
Better than most people would.
I think.

623
00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:43.988
She saved your life.

624
00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:47.992
She definitely is a Halliwell.

625
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.953
Last name or no.

626
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:55.875
I know I haven't been
the most welcoming.

627
00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:58.878
I just--

628
00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:01.297
I miss Prue so much.

629
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:05.510
It's hard to imagine opening up
to someone else.

630
00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:08.638
With everything that happens
in our lives.

631
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:11.766
love just feels like an invitation
for more pain.

632
00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:21.192
So maybe...

633
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.279
...maybe you don't start with love.

634
00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:28.324
Maybe you just start with "Thanks."

635
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.042
South Bay Social Services.

636
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.563
Muffins.

637
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.356
Thanks.

638
00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:02.567
Busywork. I'm best in the kitchen.

639
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:06.195
Prue was the one
that liked to chase demons.

640
00:40:11.117 --> 00:40:14.245
Man. he's like a whole new Donnie.

641
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.831
What did Leo say to him?

642
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:24.714
I don't know.

643
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:28.217
He's a miracle worker.
that husband of mine.

644
00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:33.681
So how are you?

645
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.811
I've had bad hours.

646
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:42.523
and hours that aren't quite so bad.

647
00:40:45.234 --> 00:40:46.527
I guess you know how it is.

648
00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:49.405
Yeah.

649
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:52.533
When my parents died.
there were some days

650
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.702
I didn't think I'd survive the sadness.

651
00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.249
It'll never be okay
that she's gone. Piper.

652
00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:02.460
But I promise it will get better.

653
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.050
You know. Leo could fix that for you.

654
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:13.388
It's my first war wound.
I think I'll wear it with pride.

655
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.350
Unfortunately. in this family.
it will not be the last.

656
00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:21.646
Well. every family
has its pros and its cons.

657
00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.732
A couple of demon battles
in exchange for the power

658
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:27.610
to clear up my friend's skin.
I'd say it's worth it.

659
00:41:27.777 --> 00:41:29.362
The power to what?

660
00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:34.492
He's cute. isn't he?

661
00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:36.661
You should've seen him yesterday.

662
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.999
Okay. you saved my life.

663
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.751
So I guess we're even on
the <i>Book of Shadows</i> swipe.

664
00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:47.880
But. Paige. there are rules
to being a witch.

665
00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:51.592
Rules that you will have to
learn and follow.

666
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:56.472
Well. not to be difficult.
but you're married to our whitelighter.

667
00:41:56.681 --> 00:42:00.018
and Phoebe's shacking up
with a demon.

668
00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:03.354
so on balance.
maybe my friend could stay cute?

669
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:06.774
Okay.

670
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.985
My. my. my.

671
00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:13.197
That pile looks about the same size
as it did about an hour ago.

672
00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.824
Oh. that was my fault.

673
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.368
I distracted her with muffins.

674
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:19.120
And you are...?

675
00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.043
I'm her sister.
