<i>Previously on</i> Yellowjackets...

2
00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.298
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.971
- Run.
- Don't hurt them!

4
00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.057
Just bring them back.

5
00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.184
Shauna. don't leave me!

6
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.477
Get it out!

7
00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.938
- If she dies. you die.
- Shauna!

8
00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.029
Take us with you.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.322
<i>In the fall of '97.</i>

10
00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.908
<i>two researchers and a guide
disappeared without a trace.</i>

11
00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.702
<i>That tape that Mom got sent?</i>

12
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.995
I think it's a part of
that research project.

13
00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.080
<i>And Mom and Tai and Van.</i>

14
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.625
<i>they all knew
exactly what it was.</i>

15
00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.420
Hi. I'm Hannah.

16
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.380
Hannah had a daughter.

17
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.050
who somehow got hold of
a tape of what we did

18
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.968
and is out to punish us.

19
00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.762
What are you planning
to do to this woman?

20
00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.472
I'm gonna sit her down

21
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.640
and have a gentle. reasonable
conversation with her.

22
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.393
Gen and Melissa got
pretty close to Hannah.

23
00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.353
Yeah. they're both dead.

24
00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.522
Oh. my God!

25
00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:09.026
Don't worry. This
isn't the end for us.

26
00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.694
You're not gonna die.

27
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.946
No. I don't want to talk to
you. Please. I-I need her.

28
00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:14.782
But I'm the one
who can save you.

29
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.867
We all know you killed Lottie.

30
00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.702

You already scanned that one.

33
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.691
It's easier this way.

34
00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:51.986
Tricks of the
trade. huh. Shipman?

35
00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:57.449
What are you doing here?

36
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.411
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

37
00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.415
Wow.

38
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.795
You really did not pan out. huh?

39
00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:13.841
So much potential. so
little to show for it.

40
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.685
Hey. Shipman. come on.

41
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.270
You're not gonna make employee
of the month like this.

42
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.106
Stop calling me Shipman.
I fucking hate it.

43
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.901
- Since when?
- Since always.

44
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.488
Why didn't you say something?

45
00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:44.371
Is this really what my
life is gonna look like?

46
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.540
How am I supposed
to know? I'm dead.

47
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.250
You killed me.

48
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.686
They're drawn to the light.

49
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.191
Should've known better.
don't you think?

50
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.668
Hey. hey. hey. slow
down on the stairs!

51
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.006
Okay. what are we
having for lunch today?

52
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.133
What did Mama make for us?

53
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.634
No more apples.

54
00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.636
Ugh. let's hope no
more apples. Worm food.

55
00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.596
- You're gonna be late!
- We know!

56
00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:08.557
And I don't want to hear
anything about the apples!

57
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.725
Don't look at me.

58
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.226
I love apples.

59
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.936
She's lying. She said
they were worm food.

60
00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.355
Betrayal.

61
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:16.606
Come on. you better get
a move on. little worm.

62
00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:17.774
or you're gonna be late.

63
00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:18.692
We're going. we're going.

64
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.901
Go get your jacket.

65
00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.361
- Bye.
- Mwah.

66
00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.363
Oh. by the way. I.
um. took your car

67
00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:25.157
to go get groceries
yesterday. and you need gas.

68
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.159
Oh. you couldn't fill it
up like a real wife would?

69
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.870
I was in a rush.
and I had to pee.

70
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:30.871
Oh.

71
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.289
Bye. love.

72
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.458
- Love you. Mama.
- I love you more.

73
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.792
- Go. go. go.
- Love you. Kelly.

74
00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:37.002
Bye. I love you. honey. Bye.

75
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.045
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

76
00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.731
Whoever the fuck you are.

77
00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.442
you better get out
here right now.

78
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.363
You have no idea whose
house you just walked into.

79
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.036
Actually...

80
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.413
...I'm pretty sure
I do. Melissa.

81
00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:16.041
Or. sorry. it's Kelly now?

82
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.294
Shauna? What are you doing here?

83
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.089

Yeah. sure. That sounds
like a great idea for me.

108
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:01.646
Um. I'm not asking.

109
00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.482
Shauna. I'm not gonna talk to
you with a knife in your hand

110
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.817
and no knife in mine.

111
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.403
We're not in high
school anymore.

112
00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:12.240
Let's act like sane adults
and both put the knives down?

113
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:14.659
Sane?

114
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.246
Like marrying the daughter
of a woman we killed?

115
00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:20.624
And changing your name to Kelly?

116
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.043
A lot's happened in
the last 25 years.

117
00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.670
No shit.

118
00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.883
We can both keep our knives.

119
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.636
Hi. Shauna.

120
00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.347
I'm just calling to
say fuck you. actually.

121
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.432
And I swear to God.
you will regret it

122
00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.726
if you do not turn that
car around right now

123
00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:42.229
and come back here
right this minute.

124
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.606
Thank you.

125
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:47.567
I'm so sorry. I know
this is hard to hear.

126
00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:50.820
but there isn't any more
we can do for her here.

127
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:53.865
I don't understand.
Are you saying...

128
00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.700
you don't have the means to
help her at this hospital?

129
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.952
Should I transfer her
to another hospital

130
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.703
that's actually competent. or...

131
00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:02.165
I'm saying it's time to
think about palliative care.

132
00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.459
Hospice.

133
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.504
- Oh. my God.
- No. that's...

134
00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.965
Hospice is for...

135
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.175
Making people as comfortable
as possible while they're...

136
00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:13.677
No.

137
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.137
- Tai.
- No!

138
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.473
I want to see her.

139
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.225
She's under sedation right now

140
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.311
while we try and keep her
stable and run a few more tests.

141
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.648
Let me get you some
paperwork for her release.

142
00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.443
Just to look over.
You have some time.

143
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.239
Oh. God.

144
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.116
Tai.

145
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.493
I'm sorry. I...

146
00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:41.204
It's okay.

147
00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:43.082
It's gonna be okay.

148
00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.294
Is there anything I can do?

149
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.047
You can help me find the
palliative care unit.

150
00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:53.675
I-I thought you said you didn't
want her transferred there.

151
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.051
We don't.

152
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.930
Come on.

153
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.440
Guys?

154
00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:16.449
Guys?!

155
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.692
Okay. Okay.

156
00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.633
It's a pretty rough hike
to the pickup point.

157
00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.968
You sure you guys are prepared?

158
00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:20.346
Don't worry about that.

159
00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.856
What about the others?

160
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.566
There's no time.

161
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:35.193
We should be doing
this together.

162
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.487
This doesn't feel right.

163
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.030
What doesn't feel right

164
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.740
about getting our
ass to civilization

165
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.575
- and sending back rescue? Hmm?
- That we aren't all here.

166
00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:44.577
That we all know Ben
was supposed to be

167
00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:47.372
- our way home. not this...
- Okay. Akilah.

168
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.873
You had a fucked-up dream

169
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:51.418
because you were
huffing cave fumes.

170
00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.420
The same way that I
tripped balls on mushrooms

171
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.589
and Lottie told me what
I was seeing. That's it.

172
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.508
You're not a prophet.

173
00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:02.262
I didn't pick you as a fucking
"seer" because I had a vision.

174
00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.764
I made it up.

175
00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.726
This is all made
up. It's not real.

176
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.229
And I think. deep
down. you know that.

177
00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.986
But what is real is
that he can get us home.

178
00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.241
So let's go.

179
00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.323
- What day is it?
- Can you get us out?

180
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.741
- Where are we?
- Get help?

181
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:05.575
Did Mulder and
Scully get together?

182
00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:06.619
Everyone. shut up!

183
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.705
Let her answer.

184
00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:13.249
Why are you here?

185
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.627
We're a...

186
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.004
...we're a research team.

187
00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:20.340
studying a species
of frogs out here.

188
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:21.841
Maybe you've heard
their mating call...

189
00:13:21.842 --> 00:13:23.760
What are people saying
about us back home?

190
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.222
Who are you?

191
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:31.309
We w... are a soccer team. um.

192
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.311
from Wiskayok. New Jersey.

193
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:34.771
Our plane crashed. and...

194
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.648
Oh. my God.

195
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.316
I remember that.

196
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.859
It was. it was all
over the news...

197
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.570
Is anyone still
searching for us?

198
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.240
I-I-I don't know.

199
00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:48.493
- They searched for months. but...
- What?

200
00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.203
Wh-What are you talking about?

201
00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.871
You have to be kidding me.

202
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:54.541
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.584
Fuck. We've been out
here a long time.

204
00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.253
Wait. so you're saying

205
00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.755
that people just... gave up?

206
00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:02.465
Our friends? Our families?

207
00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.467
I-I really don't know.

208
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.553
You can get us home. right?

209
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.763
If you got here. then
you can get us back.

210
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.892
I-I don't even know
where I am right now.

211
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.227
Fuck.

212
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.748
You don't seem to
know a lot of things.

213
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.359
Are you. like. the captain?

214
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.113
Of the team?

215
00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:28.408
If I say "yes." will you
start fucking remembering?

216
00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:30.368
- She's not the captain...
- Neither are you.

217
00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:31.494
Yeah. 'cause she's fucking dead!

218
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:34.123
Guys! Stop.

219
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:45.091
S... So. y-you all
built this yourselves?

220
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:47.302
Yeah. Who else do you
think would have done it?

221
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.721
You obviously all left
us out here to die.

222
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.640
It's impressive.

223
00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:56.312
Can you get us out of here?

224
00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:00.273
Not by myself.

225
00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:03.234
The other guy we were
with. he was our...

226
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.069
- Guys! I found them!
- What?

227
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.613
I know where they are.

228
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.949
Akilah and Travis and.
um. and-and the other one.

229
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.410
His name is Kodi.
He was our guide.

230
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.162
Come on. let's go.

231
00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.956
- Watch her.
- Come on. let's go!

232
00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:18.583
You stay here.

233
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.627
- Gen. I'm fine.
- I'm going.

234
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.295
- Watch her. too.
- It doesn't hurt.

235
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.340
I can go. I'm going.

236
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.102
Thank you.

237
00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.611
Maybe we should go
back to the room.

238
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:49.280
No. No. you're right.

239
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.616
Um...

240
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.744
Staying cooped up in that
hotel room for that long

241
00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.038
just wasn't good for
our mental health.

242
00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:00.458
Are we sure that any of
this is. like. actually...

243
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.918
Oh. shit.

244
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.461
Shit.

245
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:04.754
What?

246
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.674
It's the Joels.

247
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:13.305
Technically. only one of
them's named Joel. but...

248
00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.809
They were the work dinner your
mom torched the other night.

249
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.149
Call him over.

250
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.278
Hey. Hey. Yeah. Come on.

251
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.155
Mm. Fuck.

252
00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.032
Why don't they come over here?

253
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.034
Because. apparently. Callie.

254
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:37.286
some people just wave
other people over.

255
00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:40.331
and some people are the ones
that come over when they're...

256
00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.042
waved.

257
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

258
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.923
Well. look at. uh...

259
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.718
Fancy seeing you guys in
a place like this. huh?

260
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.012
Yeah. Hey. man. What
are you doing here?

261
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.514
Oh. you know. just...

262
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.142
You know. little
staycation. With the fam.

263
00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.977
- Staycation? Right. right.
- Staycation.

264
00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:02.437
Yeah. that's nice. man.

265
00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.605
That's my daughter.

266
00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:06.274
Oh. you were serious? Shit.

267
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.026
Sorry. man.

268
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.444
It's all right. it's all right.

269
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:12.405
Look. while I'm
here. I'd really love

270
00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:14.032
to take another swing at this...

271
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.409
What? No. Seriously?

272
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.662
I-I know our dinner
didn't go great.

273
00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.664
- But that doesn't mean I...
- Sorry.

274
00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.041
Jeff. man. we're...

275
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.333
We're going in a
different direction.

276
00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:25.835
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- I'm not sure that...

277
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.837
Oh. There he is.

278
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:32.133
Not FurnitureFam.net.

279
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:36.179
You can't go with
FurnitureFam.net.

280
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.764
That's a worse direction.

281
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.265
That's not a
different direction...

282
00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.558
Really nice to see you. Jeff.

283
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.684
It was great
talking to you. man.

284
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.061
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

285
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.187
- Hey...
- There he is.

286
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:47.733
Sit down.

287
00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.780
Hello? Misty?

288
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.698
Have you heard from Shauna?

289
00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:58.576
No. I assumed she was with you.

290
00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:01.579
Yeah. well. your assumption
should be correct.

291
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.249
but it's not. seeing as she
just ditched us at the hospital.

292
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.044
You're at a hospital. Why
are you at a hospital?

293
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:09.670
It doesn't matter.

294
00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:11.839
So. you haven't heard from her?

295
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.175
No. I... Why?

296
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.927
<i>Just tell me what's
happening. Misty.</i>

297
00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.387
Where was Shauna
the day Lottie died?

298
00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:21.432
- What?
- Where was Shauna...

299
00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.643
- Why are you asking me that?
- Why aren't you answering?

300
00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:25.436
Uh. we were...

301
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.688
Didn't we... We were
with you. Misty.

302
00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.774
We were with you and
the Bingo ladies.

303
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:30.858
Right?

304
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.693
She was there the entire day?

305
00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.695
What's going on?

306
00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.448
<i>I. too. would love to know.</i>

307
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:40.285
What's Shauna done now?

308
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.912
I got to go.

309
00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.664
Uh. if she calls you.
tell her to get her ass

310
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.082
- back here. stat.
- Misty...

311
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.625
Misty? Don't you...

312
00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.045
Misty! Misty?

313
00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:54.967
I'll call her back.

314
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.267
What's wrong?

315
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.852
Oh. noth...

316
00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.479
Nothing. Everything's good.

317
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.607
All good.

318
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.486
So good.

319
00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:21.951
You know. you could've just rang
the doorbell like a sane person.

320
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:24.954
Oh. right. I'm sorry. I
forgot... sanity's off the table.

321
00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.957
I didn't exactly know
that you lived here.

322
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.668
Or that you were alive.

323
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.545
How are you alive. by the way?

324
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.172
We all went to your funeral.

325
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.174
It turns out. if you
leave a suicide note.

326
00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:39.552
even without a body. the
cops will take the easy win.

327
00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:40.888
But why?

328
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.514
Cone on. Shauna.

329
00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.976
Are you still in love with me?

330
00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:49.187
Oh. my God.

331
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.730
No.

332
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:52.566
Are you... Is that...

333
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.067
I'm not still in love with you.

334
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:58.154
I mean. honestly. I never was.

335
00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.532
You want to know why I did it?

336
00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.618
Because I had no other choice.

337
00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:06.955
After we made it back. I
was no longer one of you.

338
00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:11.167
And you scared the absolute
fucking shit out of me.

339
00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:17.799
Don't even think about it.

340
00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.093
All right. Shauna.

341
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:23.137
Why are you here?

342
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:27.559
I want to know why
you're fucking with me.

343
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:31.312
How did you even get it?

344
00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:32.939
Hannah told me where to find it.

345
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.982
She begged me to give
it to her daughter

346
00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:37.610
if I ever made it back
home. but I. um...

347
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.612
- You didn't.
- No.

348
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.948
I couldn't. But you know that.

349
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.533
If anyone heard
what was on it...

350
00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:48.287
And what good would that have
done for her to-to know that?

351
00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:49.997
To have to live with that?

352
00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:53.001
So. you married her instead.

353
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.170
I love her.

354
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.673
She doesn't even know
your real fucking name.

355
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:00.299
I'm serious.

356
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.593
This is real.

357
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.387
This isn't some
sympathy marriage.

358
00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:07.265
or fucked-up version
of survivor's guilt.

359
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.766
I...

360
00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:11.018
Or shit. I don't
know. maybe it is.

361
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.606
But I. I couldn't
give her the tape.

362
00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.650
Although. I wanted to
make sure she was okay.

363
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.319
and for years.
that's all it was.

364
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.072
Until one day we actually met.

365
00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.283
And I swear. I tried
not to let it happen.

366
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.993
but you don't know her.

367
00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:28.786
She's...

368
00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.082
relentless and funny
and kind. and...

369
00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.168
We love each other.

370
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:38.129
I know it doesn't
matter to you. Shauna.

371
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.506
but I have a good life.

372
00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:42.633
I have a decent job.

373
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.636
I have a great kid.

374
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:47.972
I go to church.

375
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.808
I go to fucking church

376
00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:54.896
with a wife and a
kid that love me.

377
00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:58.066
You're right.

378
00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:02.321
None of that matters to me.

379
00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.490
Sit.

380
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:27.094
Okay. Akilah?

381
00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.846
Hang on. Okay?

382
00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:31.183
I swear. there's like a
rock in here. or something.

383
00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.774
Come on. We've
got to get moving.

384
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:44.780
Okay.

385
00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:48.617
Stop walking.

386
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.911
Akilah?

387
00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:57.249
Oh. fuck.

388
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.709
You're coming back to camp.

389
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.753
Now.

390
00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.171
You know there's
more of us out here

391
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.464
than just me. Hannah and Edwin.

392
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:05.633
No. There isn't.

393
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.051
We saw your camp.

394
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.637
You only have three
sleeping bags.

395
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:15.310
Let's go.

396
00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:19.855
You heard her.

397
00:23:38.708 --> 00:23:40.292
Where were you guys going?

398
00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:42.294
To get rescued.

399
00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:44.088
You were just gonna
leave us here?

400
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:48.634
No. We just thought... well.
I-I just thought that. um...

401
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.262
That it would be easier
as a small group.

402
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.848
Faster.

403
00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:56.518
Then why'd you leave a
trail behind for us to find?

404
00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:00.020
In case he turned on us.

405
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.022
Yeah. Then you would
know where to find us

406
00:24:02.023 --> 00:24:04.276
and the rescue point either way.

407
00:24:08.488 --> 00:24:10.281
Can you get us out of here?

408
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.408
- I can.
- Well. how long

409
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.618
will it take to get to the
rescue point from here?

410
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.162
Six days if you can keep up.

411
00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:18.831
Okay.

412
00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:21.292
Everyone. pack what
you can for six days.

413
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.169
We'll need designated
water carriers.

414
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.753
We'll need whatever
food we can gather...

415
00:24:24.754 --> 00:24:26.338
Maybe you didn't hear
it the first time.

416
00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:28.257
but you're not in
charge anymore.

417
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:29.633
It's fucking rescue.

418
00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.052
What do we do with them?

419
00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:34.263
We need them for...

420
00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:36.515
Yeah. I-I know. but I'm
talking about afterwards.

421
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:40.311
I mean. what if they
tell people what...

422
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.104
what they saw?

423
00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:43.856
Hey.

424
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.358
I didn't see shit.

425
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.235
We'll say whatever
you want us to say.

426
00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:50.154
Yeah. Well. we can't really
guarantee that. can we?

427
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:51.197
I swear to God.

428
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:53.616
That means nothing out here.

429
00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:56.660
Okay. we have time
to decide about this.

430
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.496
How to talk about
it when we're back.

431
00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.749
what to do about them. but...

432
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.251
Right now you should
bury your friend.

433
00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.837
Um. hello? That involves
untying their hands.

434
00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:09.174
And that's why you'll
be supervising them.

435
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.343
You guys...

436
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.637
we can finally go home.

437
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.931
We can finally go
home. Let's pack.

438
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.474
- No.
- Let's...

439
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.892
We can't go back.

440
00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:22.937
Jesus Christ. Lottie.
why the fuck not?

441
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.231
Because we don't
belong there anymore.

442
00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:26.608
What?

443
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.193
Oh. really. Lottie?

444
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.946
Why the fuck should
we listen to you?

445
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:36.242
Come on. We got a
lot of shit to do.

446
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.035
Let's fucking go.

447
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:41.330
Come on.

448
00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:56.554
Here's the thing I
don't understand.

449
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:59.807
If you're so worried
about me ruining

450
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:02.351
your perfect little life.

451
00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:04.853
why send me the fucking tape?

452
00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:06.398
Because it was
haunting me. okay?

453
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.485
I hadn't thought about
the tape in years.

454
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:14.405
I had it. uh. locked in
a safety-deposit box.

455
00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:17.700
It was my leverage in case
any of you figured out

456
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:19.618
what I did and came
looking for me.

457
00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.788
Why would we come
looking for you?

458
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:26.792
Why would Lottie start a cult?

459
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:28.544
Why would you all join it

460
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:31.880
and start making sacrifices
again to appease some...

461
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.799
I don't... whatever the fuck?

462
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.385
Okay. first of all. I
did not join the cult.

463
00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:38.637
And also.

464
00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:41.932
it's more of an intentional
community. but it...

465
00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.643
None of that matters right now.

466
00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:46.645
That's...

467
00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:49.064
- That's not what happened.
- Shauna.

468
00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:50.941
Natalie died there.

469
00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.485
And some fucking cop.

470
00:26:53.486 --> 00:26:56.614
I mean. I... I stopped sleeping.

471
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.240
One day I'm fine.

472
00:26:58.241 --> 00:27:00.284
and the next I'm having
these horrible nightmares.

473
00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:02.536
And then they start
happening during the day.

474
00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:06.165
Like the world's most
fucked-up daydreams.

475
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:08.167
I had to do something.

476
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.710
Barbara says that...

477
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:12.004
Sorry. Who the fuck is Barbara?

478
00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.798
My therapist.

479
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.051
Oh. you call her "Barbara"?

480
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:18.677
That's her name. What
else am I gonna call her?

481
00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:20.429
I don't know. Dr. Whatever.

482
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.930
She's not a doctor.

483
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.516
She's technically not
even a licensed therapist.

484
00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:26.143
She's more of an advisor.

485
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:28.562
She's extremely intuitive.

486
00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:30.773
Mm. Barbaras always are.

487
00:27:30.774 --> 00:27:34.193
So. Barbara said that

488
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:36.695
I was holding on to something.

489
00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:40.532
That if I wanted to be
free of what happened...

490
00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:44.203
of that darkness...
that I had to...

491
00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:46.372
let it go. truly.

492
00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:50.334
And that's when I
realized... the tape.

493
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.461
So. the day of Nat's funeral.

494
00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:54.630
I left it at your house
so that you could.

495
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:56.591
uh. try and do the same.

496
00:27:57.592 --> 00:27:59.051
Bullshit.

497
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:02.429
How can it be
anything but a threat?

498
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.432
Shauna. this was
all in the note.

499
00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:06.934
What note?

500
00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:08.687
The note that I
left with the tape.

501
00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:14.274
- There... You're lying.
- No. I'm...

502
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:17.027
You've been messing
with me for-for weeks.

503
00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:20.322
Trying to make me feel crazy.

504
00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:22.074
trying to kill me.

505
00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:24.326
Shauna. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

506
00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:26.745
Leaving the phone
in the bathroom

507
00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:29.164
so that it would play
"Queen of Hearts."

508
00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:31.083
Locking me in a freezer.

509
00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:32.584
Cutting my brakes.

510
00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:34.920
Clearly something's going
on with you. but I...

511
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:36.922
I should have given
you more credit.

512
00:28:36.923 --> 00:28:40.718
It-It's genius. actually.

513
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:43.345
We can make all the pacts

514
00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:46.348
and vows of silence
that we want.

515
00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:50.644
but if you really
think about it.

516
00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:54.189
the only way to truly be safe.

517
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.901
to be 100% fucking certain

518
00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:01.029
that nobody is ever gonna
spill your darkest secrets.

519
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.908
is to be the only one left.

520
00:29:05.118 --> 00:29:07.244
That's why you killed
Lottie. isn't it?

521
00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.663
That's why you pushed
her down those stairs.

522
00:29:09.664 --> 00:29:11.290
It's why you came after me.

523
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.917
Lottie's dead. too?

524
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:19.382
Tai. Tai.

525
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.717
What are you doing?

526
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:24.636
Does he. uh... have
a lot of time left?

527
00:29:24.637 --> 00:29:26.722
- Why?
- Just tell me.

528
00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:30.684
Uh... Well. he. um.

529
00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:34.981
he has end-stage
heart failure. so...

530
00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:38.067
The man is dying.

531
00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:41.112
He's dying anyway.

532
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:44.115
"He's dying anyway"?

533
00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.452
I can't lose Van.

534
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.499
Oh. wait. hold on. Hold on. hey.

535
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.125
You don't have to
be here for this.

536
00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.502
Why are you doing this?

537
00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.630
Tai.

538
00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:08.514
Fuck!

539
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:11.683
What? I didn't... It wasn't...

540
00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.435
- I didn't... Do you think...
- Okay.

541
00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:14.728
Does that count?

542
00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:16.980
We have to get out of here.

543
00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.440
I'm not leaving without Van.

544
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:21.026
Yeah. I know. I know.
I know. Let's go.

Van? Can I talk to

564
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.891
What if we can't be
together when we get back?

565
00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:37.061
Why wouldn't we?

566
00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:39.897
We've been out here a long time.

567
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:43.275
but it hasn't been
that long back there.

568
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:44.818
Okay. what do you mean?

569
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:46.820
I mean. what if...

570
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:49.239
Do you really think the
world has changed that much?

571
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.992
- I'm optimistic.
- Why?

572
00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.369
Because...

573
00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:56.079
Me.

574
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.123
I need you to be serious.

575
00:31:58.124 --> 00:31:59.751
I am being serious.

576
00:32:01.794 --> 00:32:04.129
Aren't you worried

577
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.048
about what we're gonna
have to tell people?

578
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:08.258
All of the lies

579
00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:11.929
we will have to memorize and be
on the exact same page about?

580
00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:16.141
Everything we've done out here?

581
00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:20.270
What happened to
Jackie and Javi and...

582
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.816
No matter what. we can't
trust the scientists.

583
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:27.194
Oh. shit. We're gonna
have to kill them. Van.

584
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:29.112
- Tai.
- And even then.

585
00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:31.323
someone could slip
up when we get home.

586
00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:33.533
and then everyone would
know what we did and...

587
00:32:33.534 --> 00:32:36.119
I don't know what would happen.
but it wouldn't be good for us.

588
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:40.123
Our futures would be fucked.

589
00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:44.295
This will follow us for
the rest of our lives.

590
00:32:45.588 --> 00:32:48.799
This place will follow us

591
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.135
for the rest of
our fucking lives.

592
00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:55.973
Why is no one
thinking about this?

593
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:59.893
Because getting
rescued and going home

594
00:32:59.894 --> 00:33:03.272
outweighs all of that.

595
00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:07.943
Okay? Just go get a bag

596
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:09.821
and let's put some shit in it.

597
00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:37.222
You're being weird. Melissa.

598
00:33:37.223 --> 00:33:38.890
Why?

599
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:41.435
I'm actually being
completely fucking normal.

600
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:44.062
given the situation.

601
00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:45.897
- Rescue?
- No.

602
00:33:45.898 --> 00:33:47.899
I'm fucking thrilled
to be rescued.

603
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.569
Can't wait to get away from you.

604
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.947
- What's your problem now?
- You!

605
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.575
My fucking arm is in a sling

606
00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:58.910
because that fucking guy
shot an arrow through me.

607
00:33:58.911 --> 00:34:00.746
and when you got back to
camp and saw me bleeding out.

608
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:02.039
you didn't even care.

609
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.168
You didn't even
ask if I was okay.

610
00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:08.379
You just ran off.

611
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.216
I knew that Gen would get
the bleeding under control.

612
00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:15.635
and I knew you
weren't gonna die.

613
00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:17.054
And I also knew that

614
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:18.889
I'm the fastest on the team.

615
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.309
I wanted to be the person
who got the guy who shot you.

616
00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:24.437
- You're lying.
- Believe what you want.

617
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:28.106
But just know that I'm still
not ruling out killing him

618
00:34:28.107 --> 00:34:29.317
for shooting you. so...

619
00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:33.571
Stop being a bitch.

620
00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.249
Here.

621
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:56.802
Do you know what the first
thing you're gonna do is

622
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.011
when we get back?

623
00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.137
What?

624
00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:01.264
Like. the dream thing to do.

625
00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:03.850
What you're most excited for?

626
00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:05.936
Oh.

627
00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.854
'Cause I'm excited
for everything.

628
00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:09.356
I want to do everything.

629
00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.149
Everything I thought
I wouldn't get to do

630
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.400
because we're out here.

631
00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:14.611
Like. college and then

632
00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:17.239
graduating college and
then working a normal job.

633
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.783
I don't even care
how boring it is.

634
00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:22.119
You know. I can't wait
to work a nine-to-five.

635
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.579
A-And then I want to
get a gym membership

636
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.998
and not even use it. and then...

637
00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.509
Shauna? Hello?

638
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.636
Shauna.

639
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:41.139
What?

640
00:35:44.016 --> 00:35:45.851
Are you gonna take this
back home with you?

641
00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:08.707
I'm not fucking stupid.

642
00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:11.543
No. You're not.

643
00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:13.880
And I'm not insane.

644
00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:21.053
I'm not insane.

645
00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:28.185
I'm not saying you are.
but... I didn't kill Lottie.

646
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.563
I didn't do any of
those things you said.

647
00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:35.526
I don't believe you.

648
00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:43.867
My life is normal. It's boring.

649
00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:46.370
And that's exactly
how I want it.

650
00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:53.251
Shauna. you really can
put the past behind you.

651
00:36:53.252 --> 00:36:56.964
This... isn't normal.

652
00:36:58.257 --> 00:37:00.800
It's a fucking lie.

653
00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:04.054
And the only reason that you
can even pretend it's normal

654
00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:07.433
is because you aren't you.

655
00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:13.146
I hate to break
it to you. but...

656
00:37:13.147 --> 00:37:15.523
you don't have a normal life.

657
00:37:19.278 --> 00:37:24.116
You don't get to
have a normal life.

658
00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:30.790
Fuck.

659
00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:40.174
Is that your daughter?

660
00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:46.430
You say I'm living a lie.
Does she know what you did?

661
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.099
What you're capable of?

662
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.686
Actually. she does.

663
00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:55.773
And she still loves you?

664
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:59.777
Yes.

665
00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:02.947
She does.

666
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.996
Who's lying now?

667
00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:15.333
Hey.

668
00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:17.794
Would just love to
know you aren't dead.

669
00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:20.255
And also...

670
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:24.301
I think you're breaking Dad.
Just call us back. please?

671
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.720
Misty. Misty. you
got to talk to me.

672
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:28.388
I can help you.

673
00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:32.100
What's wrong with Shauna?
Please call me back. Please!

674
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:35.146
Freaky little
four-eyed mushroom.

675
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.150
Hello?

676
00:38:45.531 --> 00:38:49.993
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I-I can't.

677
00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:59.378
Dad! I need you to
pull it together.

678
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:04.966
You're right. I'm sorry.

679
00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:09.763
You need one of your parents
to hold it together right now.

680
00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:11.056
What do you mean "one"?

681
00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:12.183
Nothing.

682
00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.311
I didn't mean anything by that.

683
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.356
Dad. I'm gonna say
something crazy.

684
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:24.277
but I-I think that you're
thinking it. too. I...

685
00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:26.571
I don't think
anyone's after Mom.

686
00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:30.116
I don't either. Wait.
Why do you say that?

687
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:31.243
Why do you?

688
00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:38.792
Oh. I don't know. A
lot of stuff. I guess.

689
00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:41.669
Like. the brakes on the van.

690
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.215
she just jumped to
somebody cutting them.

691
00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:48.886
And the phone and the
freezer stuff and...

692
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.393
God. It just doesn't add up.

693
00:39:58.187 --> 00:40:00.898
What about you?

694
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:04.777
I...

695
00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:09.239
I-I-I can't... explain it.

696
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.827
It's just. like... a feeling.

697
00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:18.248
Look. I don't know
what Mom or...

698
00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:21.335
any of them did to
survive. but I...

699
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.088
I think that it messed them up.

700
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:29.134
Like. really messed them up.
and way more than we thought.

701
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:31.970
And whatever happened
to Lottie. it...

702
00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:34.431
it doesn't have
anything to do with us.

703
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.568
Yeah.

705

into a quarter pounder

717
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:34.324
and then washing it
all down with a Sprite.

718
00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.493
No. you got to end
with the fries.

719
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:38.161

724
00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.587
What's happening?

725
00:42:38.472 --> 00:42:40.099
What's wrong?

726
00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:51.776
Is this real?

727
00:42:51.777 --> 00:42:53.319
Is what real?

728
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.862
The animals... are they
moving? Are they okay?

729
00:42:54.863 --> 00:42:56.282
Yes.

730
00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:58.826
Why?

731
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.619
Did you s...

732
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.205
see something?

733
00:43:27.813 --> 00:43:29.523
Goodbye. Coach.

734
00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:35.821
I'm sorry you didn't
make it to this moment.

735
00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:39.533
I wish you did.

736
00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:02.388
We are going home.

737
00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.350
Got it?

738
00:44:05.392 --> 00:44:09.605
We are leaving whatever
you are behind.

739
00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:53.940
Please. I need to see her.

740
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:55.942
I need to be with her.

741
00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:58.069
Let me in.

742
00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.362
I can't.

743
00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.698
I'm the only one
that can help her.

744
00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:04.201
You won't do what
needs to be done.

745
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.746
- You never did believe.
- Please.

746
00:45:08.747 --> 00:45:12.208
I believe. Please!

747
00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.253
Please. let me in.

748
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:19.258
- Ready?
- Hell yeah. I am.

749
00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:21.927
Oh. let's go.

750
00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:28.182
All right.

751
00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:30.227
Everybody. listen up.

752
00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:36.566
We're trusting you to
get us there safely.

753
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.359
And I think you know
that we will kill you

754
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.779
if you try any stupid shit.

755
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.490
Yeah. it's very clear.

756
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.576
We won't try anything.

757
00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:49.079
We want to go home. too.

758
00:45:52.499 --> 00:45:54.042
Good.

759
00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.128
Let's fucking do this!

760
00:45:57.129 --> 00:45:59.506
Let's fucking go! Let's go!

761
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:01.924
I'm staying.

762
00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.051
What?

763
00:46:04.887 --> 00:46:06.763
Yeah. cute joke. Lott.

764
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.681
- Not joking.
- What?

765
00:46:08.682 --> 00:46:10.016
- Are you fucking crazy?
- She actually

766
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:11.810
- might be crazy.
- Why?

767
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.941
Lottie. Look...

768
00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:21.152
Lottie.

769
00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:22.987
I know it's a lot.

770
00:46:22.988 --> 00:46:24.907
It's fucking scary. going back.

771
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:30.787
I think we all kind of gave
up on it happening. but...

772
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:33.123
this is very real.

773
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:36.918
This is rescue.

774
00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:38.545
I mean. this is home.

775
00:46:41.006 --> 00:46:42.633
That's not home. Nat.

776
00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:46.970
What home do you
have to go back to?

777
00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:50.808
I can't go back.

778
00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.312
If I go back...

779
00:46:57.523 --> 00:46:59.066
...nothing will be...

780
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:01.526
...well.

781
00:47:03.403 --> 00:47:04.780
I won't...

782
00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:07.406
I won't be well.

783
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:11.244
I won't be me.

784
00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:13.038
The me that was made out here.

785
00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:18.125
And that unwellness
that I feel...

786
00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:20.879
I feel it so deeply in my bones.

787
00:47:22.714 --> 00:47:25.175
We're safer here.

788
00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.639
Fine.

789
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.767
You know what? You stay. then.

790
00:47:37.062 --> 00:47:40.399
Everyone else. let's go.

791
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:47.530
I'm staying. too.

792
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.074
Oh. for fuck's sake.
Shauna! Come on.

793
00:47:50.075 --> 00:47:51.702
You feel It. too?

794
00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:56.497
I'm not staying
because of you or It.

795
00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:58.792
Why the fuck would
you stay at all?

796
00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:04.131
I don't know.

797
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.176
Something just...

798
00:48:09.177 --> 00:48:11.054
something just
doesn't feel right.

799
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:18.686
No. Tai. no.

800
00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:20.605
No. No. Tai. pick it up.

801
00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:22.607
Pick it up. No way.

802
00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:24.400
You're not staying.
You're coming with us.

803
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.571
Whatever the fuck Shauna and
Lottie have been feeling...

804
00:48:28.822 --> 00:48:30.615
...I've been feeling. too.
since those two arrived.

805
00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:33.284
Who cares?

806
00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:36.203
God. since when has that
ever mattered to you?

807
00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:38.456
Please. please. Tai. look at me.

808
00:48:38.457 --> 00:48:41.208
You are not staying here.

809
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:43.294
- I have to.
- Why?

810
00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:45.130
I'm telling you...

811
00:48:46.214 --> 00:48:48.591
something doesn't feel right.

812
00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.302
Has everyone gone
fucking insane?!

813
00:48:51.303 --> 00:48:53.763
Okay. what doesn't feel right

814
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:56.642
- is staying and ignoring rescue.
- Yeah.

815
00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:03.814
Okay.

816
00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:05.400
Fuck it.

817
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:09.362
Stay. then.

818
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:12.240
You've all lost
your fucking minds.

819
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:17.496
The rest of us are going.

820
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:21.959
No.

821
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:31.468
You're not.

822
00:49:36.014 --> 00:49:38.975
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

823
00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.519
Uh...

824
00:49:42.187 --> 00:49:43.437
Checking out.

825
00:49:43.438 --> 00:49:46.565
Room 2106 and 2107.

826
00:49:46.566 --> 00:49:48.317
Great.

827
00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:51.529
All right. Well. unless you
just raided the minibar.

828
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.822
you should be all set.

829
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.156
Oh. I'm just kidding.

830
00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.450
Yeah. we wish we had minibars.

831
00:49:56.451 --> 00:49:58.035
Oh.

832
00:49:58.036 --> 00:49:59.829
That's good.

833
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.456
Yeah. I guess checking out isn't
even a thing anymore. is it?

834
00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:04.291
It's all electronic now.

835
00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:05.710
All in the cloud.

836
00:50:07.462 --> 00:50:09.672
I guess. yeah.

837
00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.216
I still... I-I like the
face-to-face. I do. I like it.

838
00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:14.510
I like that we still have
gas station attendants

839
00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:17.013
here in New Jersey. Thank
you. It's... You know.

840
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.723
- I could pump my own gas.
- Dad?

841
00:50:18.724 --> 00:50:21.934
But there's something
about... Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

842
00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:23.728
Uh. have a good day.

843
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:24.729
Have a great day.

844
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:25.855
Jordan.

845
00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.274
Have a great day. sir.

846
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.279
Oh.

847
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.613
One second.

848
00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:36.574
Uh. Joels! Hey!

849
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:37.826
Oh. God.

850
00:50:40.245 --> 00:50:42.413
My wife ruined our dinner.

851
00:50:42.414 --> 00:50:44.248
I didn't.

852
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:47.293
My business didn't.
My talent didn't.

853
00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:48.586
- Jeff. buddy. come on. man...
- No. no. no.

854
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.755
Hey. Listen.

855
00:50:50.756 --> 00:50:53.507
Now. my wife hasn't been...

856
00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:57.011
clinically diagnosed as
being a fucking crazy person.

857
00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:58.971
but for all intents and
purposes of this discussion

858
00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:02.808
we're having here
right now. she is.

859
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:04.602
- Y...
- Yeah.

860
00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:07.104
She is. And she's the reason
you didn't like that dinner

861
00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:09.523
and thus didn't like me.

862
00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:11.108
She's the fucking
reason most people

863
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:13.153
don't fucking like
anything. She's miserable.

864
00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.405
But I'm not her.

865
00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.199
I'm not her.

866
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.494
I'm the reason most
people like anything.

867
00:51:21.495 --> 00:51:23.997
I'm affable.

868
00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.417
Don't give up on me. guys.

869
00:51:29.669 --> 00:51:32.297
Haven't you ever fallen in
love with an unhinged woman?

870
00:51:33.507 --> 00:51:36.634
Or has every woman you ever
been with been fucking boring?

871
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.390
Anyway. Cal.

872
00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:47.145
I am the best man for this job.

873
00:51:48.855 --> 00:51:50.773
Just wanted you to know that.

874
00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.400
Let's go home.

875
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:57.488
Were your brakes cut. Shauna.
or is your car just old?

876
00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:00.741
Did someone lock
you in a freezer

877
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:02.493
or do walk-in freezers
just have doors

878
00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:04.912
that don't stay open
unless you prop them open?

879
00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:07.790
- No. That's...
- Someone left

880
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.667
a cell phone in a bathroom
with a popular song

881
00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:11.669
as a ringtone... wow.

882
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.962
Fuck you.

883
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.506
Did someone murder Lottie

884
00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:17.424
or did she just
struggle from a lifetime

885
00:52:17.425 --> 00:52:20.011
of mental health issues?

886
00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:26.475
This is what you do. Shauna.
You create your own problems.

887
00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:28.686
You stir the pot
just to feel alive.

888
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.980
I mean. even before the
plane crash. weren't you

889
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:33.066
fucking your best friend's
boyfriend behind her back?

890
00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:35.484
You stew and you seethe

891
00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.403
and you make it
everyone else's problem

892
00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:39.196
because you hate to be alone.

893
00:52:39.197 --> 00:52:40.739
You hate yourself.

894
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.409
And you want
everyone else to feel

895
00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.495
just as miserable as you are.

896
00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:48.998
Relax.

897
00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.916
I just need some water.

898
00:52:50.917 --> 00:52:53.711
- Do you want some?
- No.

899
00:52:53.712 --> 00:52:55.880
So...

900
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:57.715
did you come here to kill me?

901
00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.341
Or...

902
00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.886
I don't... Sorry.
I just honestly

903
00:53:01.887 --> 00:53:04.054
don't know what your plan was

904
00:53:04.055 --> 00:53:06.183
when you broke in here. Um...

905
00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.187
You know what I think?

906
00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:14.232
I think you came here because
you want your life to explode.

907
00:53:15.233 --> 00:53:16.734
It's fun for you.

908
00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:18.278
It lights you up.

909
00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:22.616
You want to burn it all
down just so you can watch.

910
00:53:24.451 --> 00:53:26.410
Fuck!

911
00:54:06.993 --> 00:54:08.619
Eat it.

912
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.913
What the fuck?

913
00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:13.082
You really are insane.

914
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:15.125
Eat it.

915
00:54:15.126 --> 00:54:18.045
Or I'll fucking tell your family

916
00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:20.839
exactly who you really are.
