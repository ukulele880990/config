Still can't
afford to buy a boat.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.930
You know what they used
to call me in the army. right?

4
00:00:14.057 --> 00:00:16.357
-Mr. Fish and Loaves.
-That's right! That's right!

5
00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:19.194
No matter what the resources.
I would make it work.

6

-Dad!
-Oh!

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.550
Welcome
to your worst nightmare.

8
00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.328
It's Mom. I think this
place is starting to get to her.

9
00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:29.513
You've been going out there
for weeks now.

10
00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:31.338
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

11
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.466
Help your Mom get everybody
secured. tucked away.

12
00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:36.168
And when I get home tonight. we
will talk.

13
00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:37.337
I promise.

15
00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:48.442
The only way
for us to go home

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.830
is to wake everyone up.

17
00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.792
-Abby. stop!

18
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.841
I found something. s-something
I think is gonna help us.

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.446
Mom!

20

-No. no!

00:00:57.492 --> 00:00:59.362
-They're in the house!

22

We have to go.

Go where?
Where are we going?

24
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:07.281
You go first.

25
00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.365
I'll follow you down.

26
00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:10.114
We need to get to town.

27
00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.289
No. We have to go to the trees.

28
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:15.381
You have to get inside.

29
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.470
The tree? No!

30
00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:17.598
You'll be safe!

31
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.209
-What?
-I promise.

32
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.730
-Go. go!
-No. wait!

33
00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:23.173
Find your brother.
I'll be right behind--

34
00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:27.354
You went through
a Farway tree!

35
00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:28.608
-Honey...
-What is going on?

36
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.310
What's happening?

37
00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:33.008
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

38
00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:35.486
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

39
00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.047
Is anybody out there?

40
00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:40.714
All I got was some static. but it worked.

41
00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:42.229
I think if we get it up
over the tree line.

42
00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:43.843
and we get it enough power.

43
00:01:43.973 --> 00:01:45.413
I think we could
get a signal out.

44
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.500
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

45
00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.369
We start by going
to the high ground.

46
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.330
If these voices
are real.

47
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.069
if something here is
communicating with you.

48
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.460
then that means you're
connected to this place

49
00:01:54.592 --> 00:01:56.202
in a way that
no one else here is.

50
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.203
But we need proof.

51
00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:58.864
What is this?

52
00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:01.118
They said they
watched you bury the bag

53
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.171
and that this is proof
that they're real.

54
00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:06.428
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

55
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:07.951
Tell me you're joking.

56
00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:09.964
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

57

the way we all go home.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.391
Making sure we
find our way back.

182
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:37.351
All right. let's go.

183
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.500
How do you know
it's not just like the road?

184
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:55.241
What's that?

185
00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:57.202
It just goes
in one big loop

186
00:14:57.331 --> 00:15:00.201
and then brings
you back to town.

187
00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:03.124
How do you know this
isn't the same?

188
00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.689
How do you know we
won't just walk and...

189
00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:09.729
walk and walk.

190
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:12.605
and then end up right back
in town where we started?

191
00:15:12.737 --> 00:15:15.087
I don't.

192
00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:17.958
Guess we'll see.

193
00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:22.097
Let me ask you a question.

194
00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:24.265
You say those voices told you

195
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:28.931
that killing those people
would get everyone home.

196
00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:31.228
You ever stop to think
that maybe they were lying?

197
00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.405
I don't want to talk about that.
-Wait. wait. wait.

198
00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:37.275
I think. if we're gonna start
second-guessing

199
00:15:37.414 --> 00:15:40.244
each other's decisions.
then that seems like

200
00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:42.294
a fair question to ask.

201
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:45.029
So. what is it?
What exactly

202
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:47.641
did they tell you that made you
willing to kill that little boy?

203
00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:50.652
You wouldn't understand.

204
00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:52.685
Try me.

205
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:55.781
They told me...

206
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.311
that those people were coming.

207
00:15:58.435 --> 00:16:01.255
They told me that there
would be two cars!

208
00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:04.135
And they said that if
I didn't do what they said...

209
00:16:05.703 --> 00:16:07.273
Then what?

210
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:09.271
If you didn't do
what they said. then what?

211
00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:13.803
Hey. let me explain to you
again how this works.

212
00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:15.979
I say jump. you jump.

213
00:16:16.105 --> 00:16:17.925
I ask you a question.
then you goddamn answer...

214
00:16:18.064 --> 00:16:21.204
They said my brother
would die. okay?!

215
00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:27.375
They said that
if I didn't do it.

216
00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.288
that he would die.
that everyone would die!

217
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:42.179
Why didn't you
just put me in the box?

218
00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:44.655
I don't know!
I thought...

219
00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:50.046
Hey.

220
00:17:02.369 --> 00:17:06.029
I've seen this town
make good people...

221
00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:11.158
do bad things.

222
00:17:16.861 --> 00:17:18.601
Let's keep moving.

223
00:17:20.256 --> 00:17:30.046
♪

224
00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.931
I don't understand.

225
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.226
Ethan said
he thinks it's a puzzle.

226
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:39.841
No. not a puzzle.

227
00:17:39.971 --> 00:17:42.021
A story.

228
00:17:42.148 --> 00:17:43.368
They all fit together
and tell a story.

229
00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:45.927
And once we
figure out the story.

230
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.235
we'll know what to do next.

231
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:51.461
That's how it works.

232
00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:54.252
Yeah. um. I think
we should stop seeing these.

233
00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:56.417
But we have to.

234
00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:59.253
We can't finish the quest unless
we figure out the story.

235
00:17:59.382 --> 00:18:01.172
I'm not scared.
I promise.

236
00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:02.727
I know.

237
00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:07.125
Do you think Dad's
tower's gonna work?

238
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.740
I don't know. I mean. we'll just
have to wait and see.

239
00:18:12.003 --> 00:18:13.923
Where do you
think this one goes?

240
00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:16.309
Oh. yeah. this is super healthy.

241
00:18:16.443 --> 00:18:17.533
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. Okay.

242
00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:20.531
Okay. We should--
We should stop.

243
00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:22.754
Um. maybe we should
play another game.

244
00:18:22.884 --> 00:18:25.104
What kind of game?

245
00:18:26.453 --> 00:18:27.373
Um...

246
00:18:27.497 --> 00:18:30.067
Okay.

247
00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:32.976
A game called
"When I get home. I..."

248
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.982
And we just say whatever
we're looking forward to

249
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.774
the most about getting home.

250
00:18:36.898 --> 00:18:38.938
I'll start.

251
00:18:39.074 --> 00:18:42.344
When I get home. I...

252
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:46.429
I will go to Giovelli's

253
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.950
and I will order...

254
00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:50.964
everything on that menu.

255
00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:53.306
Maybe two of everything
on the menu.

256
00:18:53.436 --> 00:18:54.956
Your turn. Jules.

257
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.310
This is stupid.

258
00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.750
Oh. come on. Jules.

259
00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:00.306
Fine.

260
00:19:00.443 --> 00:19:03.273
When I get home.
I'm going to. um...

261
00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:10.536
I'm gonna call my friends and...

262
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:13.801
I'm just gonna call them.

263
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.370
What about you?

264
00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:21.455
When I get home. I...

265
00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:24.545
I want us to be happy.
like we are here.

266
00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:27.815
We never play games
around the table at home.

267
00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:37.221
Okay. look.

268
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.180
most of these batteries are way
past their expiration date.

269
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.230
All right. we've got the
newer batteries from my car

270
00:19:43.356 --> 00:19:46.916
and that giant lunchbox that
you guys were driving. but...

271
00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:50.492
even those'd drain
in a couple of hours.

272
00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:53.454
We need something that'll
keep this running for days

273
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:56.673
or weeks. right? Not hours.

274
00:19:56.804 --> 00:19:58.554
What we do is we-we
take the batteries.

275
00:19:58.675 --> 00:20:00.325
we put 'em in the cars
and then we just run the cars

276
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.460
to recharge them.

277
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:03.031
And then what?
Burn how much fuel?

278
00:20:03.158 --> 00:20:04.938
Look. the point is.
you're either burning out

279
00:20:05.073 --> 00:20:06.683
one vital resource or another.

280
00:20:06.814 --> 00:20:09.214
which would be fine if this
was guaranteed to work.

281
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:10.948
but let's be honest.
man. it probably won't!

282
00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.909
Hey. Keep it down.

283
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.570
Has anyone seen Victor?

284
00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:26.881
Look. if you would just
take a look at the symbol.

285
00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:29.008
Open the book!

286
00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.580
What is wrong with you?

287
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.538
We have a legitimate chance here
to go home and you're...

288
00:20:40.064 --> 00:20:41.984
You know what?
Just go.

289
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.590
Go.
Go. go find Victor.

290
00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:46.721
Do whatever you want.

291
00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:50.294
I'll stay here. and I'll
figure this out myself.

292
00:20:50.423 --> 00:20:52.383
There's nothing to figure out.
There's no power source.

293
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.300
Jim. this isn't
Gilligan's Island.

294
00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:58.559
You're not gonna build a radio
with palm leaves and coconuts.

295
00:20:58.692 --> 00:21:00.872
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

296
00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:07.002
Whatever.

297
00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:23.024
What do you want?

298
00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:27.325
I. uh...
I heard what happened.

299
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.590
You okay?

300
00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:32.293
Not my bathroom
the asshole hung himself in.

301
00:21:34.684 --> 00:21:36.514
Shouldn't you be out there

302
00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:39.043
rounding up supplies
or building a spaceship

303
00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:40.467
or some shit?

304
00:21:40.603 --> 00:21:41.693
I'm just saying. if...

305
00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:43.002
if you
want someone to talk to--

306
00:21:45.173 --> 00:21:46.263
Oh. so. now you're sheriff.

307
00:21:46.392 --> 00:21:48.612
you're gonna start
doling out words of wisdom?

308
00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:51.482
One thing I always
appreciated about Boyd

309
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:53.444
is he minded his own business.

310
00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:59.225
Well. I'm gonna take a few
people down to the barn.

311
00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:01.101
salvage some more wood
for the tower.

312
00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:02.232
Maybe if you want to...

313
00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:04.634
come with us or...
I don't know.

314
00:22:04.758 --> 00:22:06.108
You want wood?

315
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:10.149
We got plenty of wood.

316
00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:11.765
Where are you going?

317
00:22:11.895 --> 00:22:13.675
Let's get wood!

318
00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:17.416
Donna!

319
00:22:17.553 --> 00:22:18.473
Come on!

320
00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:20.468
I'm saving you a trip!

321
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.080
Donna!

322
00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:27.426
Donna! Hey!

323
00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:31.484
Hey!

324
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.481
Donna!

325
00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:34.833
Donna! Hey!

326
00:22:34.962 --> 00:22:36.792
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

327
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.360
-Hey!
-Donna. wait. wait. wait!

328
00:22:38.487 --> 00:22:40.617
Oh. calm the fuck down!
I'm not a fuckin' psycho.

329
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.670
You said we needed wood?
Let's get wood.

330
00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.056
Wha...? Okay.

331
00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:49.235
Donna. please.

332
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.588
Better here than any of
that half-rotten shit

333
00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:53.068
you're gonna pull off the barn.

334
00:22:55.504 --> 00:22:57.814
You gonna get her to stop
or you want me to?

335
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:59.681
Donna. stop! We need--
we need this place intact.

336
00:22:59.813 --> 00:23:01.823
For what? Huh?

337
00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:03.815
We're all going home. right?

338
00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:06.337
We don't need
this place anymore.

339
00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:09.612
Your glorious tower's
gonna get us all home.

340
00:23:09.736 --> 00:23:12.906
No need to keep
this place standing.

341
00:23:13.043 --> 00:23:16.743
It's not a home anymore.
It's a fucking tomb!

342
00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:20.046
The fuck!

343
00:23:20.181 --> 00:23:21.401
Fuck!

344
00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:31.366
Look. can we please--

345
00:23:31.497 --> 00:23:33.457
Can we please just take
a minute and let's--

346
00:23:33.586 --> 00:23:34.406
Fuck off!

347
00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:41.897
Aw. fuck!

348
00:23:43.683 --> 00:23:46.213
Oh. fuck.
Oh. fuck.

349
00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:11.753
It was nice that Ellis came
to see you before you left.

350
00:24:11.885 --> 00:24:14.095
I'm sure he appreciates
what you're doing.

351
00:24:17.368 --> 00:24:19.808
I heard the story about what
happened with your wife.

352
00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:21.716
what you had to do.

353
00:24:21.851 --> 00:24:23.771
We're not gonna talk
about that.

354
00:24:23.897 --> 00:24:25.937
That's okay.

355
00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:27.203
We don't have to. It's...

356
00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:32.598
It's just. in some ways...

357
00:24:32.732 --> 00:24:35.522
you remind me of Nathan.

358
00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:39.906
I mean. you're a lot
more gruff than he was.

359
00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:43.263
But you always put other
people's needs before your own.

360
00:24:43.394 --> 00:24:45.794
That's how he ended up here.

361
00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:48.359
I don't think he'd like
what we're doing now.

362
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:49.917
And why is that?

363
00:24:50.053 --> 00:24:53.363
Nathan had a theory
about this place.

364
00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:57.372
If we tried to leave.
if we pushed too hard.

365
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.626
then something
would push back.

366
00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:07.845
What is that?

367
00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:13.123
I don't know.

368
00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:26.955
Are you sure it was
coming from this direction?

369
00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:31.311
Let's go.

370
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:47.023
I thought you said no one
had been out this far before.

371
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.980
No.

372
00:25:57.164 --> 00:25:58.384
What are you doing?

373
00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:01.083
Look. there's
something inside them.

374
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:03.041
We gotta get one down.

375
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.210
Just. uh...

376
00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:07.695
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

377
00:26:07.827 --> 00:26:09.047
Maybe we should...

378
00:26:11.047 --> 00:26:11.827
Hey. what's wrong?

379
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:13.011
Ow!

380
00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:15.006
Ow!

381
00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:16.098
Whoa. Sara.

382
00:26:16.226 --> 00:26:17.836
Ow!

383
00:26:17.967 --> 00:26:20.877
Hey. hey. hey.
Hey. you're okay.

384
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:22.154
-You're okay.
-Ow!

385
00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:23.186
Look at me. Sara.
You're okay.

386
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.020
No! No!

387
00:26:25.148 --> 00:26:26.668
Look...
What's going on?

388
00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:27.802
Sara! Sara!

389
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:31.333
I can hear them!
I can...

390
00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:32.809
-No. no. Talk to me.

391
00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:34.159
Talk to me. Talk to me.

392
00:26:34.288 --> 00:26:35.718
-No. no. no. no!

393
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:37.635
No! No!

394
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.120
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!
Don't. don't! No. no!

395
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.210
No. Sara?
No. no. no. Okay.

396
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.130
No. Sara! Sara! Hey!

397
00:26:50.478 --> 00:26:51.738
How's the magic
tower coming?

398
00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:00.184
You know. all the time
I've been here.

399
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:01.884
this is first you've
set foot in this place.

400
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:09.894
Because you serve piss water.
Your distilling is for shit.

401
00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:12.939
At least here.
I can be alone.

402
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.590
Oh.

403
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:17.371
Kinda feels like
a banner day today.

404
00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.895
Feel like
I'm holding court.

405
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:22.029
You mind
giving us a second?

406
00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:24.772
Yeah.

407
00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:27.434
I'll leave this here.

408
00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:29.298
Give me a holler
if you need anything. okay?

409
00:27:34.435 --> 00:27:37.695
Are you okay?

410
00:27:40.354 --> 00:27:42.014
Donna. I know you're
upset about Eric.

411
00:27:42.138 --> 00:27:43.918
but there's
nothing you could have--

412
00:27:44.053 --> 00:27:46.063
Oh. for fuck's sake.
it's not about that.

413
00:27:48.536 --> 00:27:51.966
Eric punched his own ticket.

414
00:27:52.105 --> 00:27:56.105
Kid's got a right to
go out the way he wants.

415
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:58.419
Why don't you just
fuck off and leave me be.

416
00:27:58.546 --> 00:28:02.586
Go back to your
little fantasy land.

417
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:05.814
You don't think
the tower's gonna work.

418
00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:08.635
Do you?

419
00:28:08.774 --> 00:28:13.264
I think it might.
I think it's worth trying.

420
00:28:13.387 --> 00:28:14.817
And what happens
when you fail?

421
00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:18.216
Then we try again.

422
00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:19.438
No!

423
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:22.267
No. ya stupid little shit.

424
00:28:22.396 --> 00:28:24.956
That's the point.
You don't try again.

425
00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:27.054
because you got
people's hopes up.

426
00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:28.923
you made them believe.

427
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:31.355
You take that away now
and they're lost.

428
00:28:31.492 --> 00:28:34.712
they give up.
and then they fucking die.

429
00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:41.066
'Cause it isn't some
grade-school softball game

430
00:28:41.197 --> 00:28:43.197
where everyone gets
a participation medal.

431
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.460
You don't know!

432
00:28:45.593 --> 00:28:47.943
You don't remember
what it was like before

433
00:28:48.074 --> 00:28:50.084
because you weren't here.

434
00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:56.209
You wanna know
what I'm grieving?

435
00:28:56.343 --> 00:29:01.043
I'm grieving the loss of what
we almost made this place.

436
00:29:01.174 --> 00:29:04.314
I'm grieving the fact that.
for a little while.

437
00:29:04.438 --> 00:29:07.088
this place almost felt like
something that could work.

438
00:29:07.223 --> 00:29:10.443
I am grieving the fact that
you guys are so caught up

439
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:13.404
in playing Mr. Fucking Wizard
that you can't see

440
00:29:13.534 --> 00:29:15.884
what this place is
gonna become when you fail.

441
00:29:26.242 --> 00:29:29.902
So. what are
we supposed to do?

442
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:31.729
What are we supposed to do?

443
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:33.337
Just sit here
and not try to go home?

444
00:29:35.382 --> 00:29:36.952
Live in a place where
those things come to hunt us

445
00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:38.039
every single night?

446
00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:40.867
Oh. God. the fuck...

447
00:29:40.996 --> 00:29:42.736
Why not?

448
00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:45.038
At least here.
the monsters have the decency

449
00:29:45.174 --> 00:29:47.394
to show you what they are.

450
00:29:52.703 --> 00:29:57.533
I know you guys from town
look at Colony House

451
00:29:57.665 --> 00:30:02.145
and figure it's all just
drinking and fucking.

452
00:30:02.278 --> 00:30:05.108
But it was more than that.

453
00:30:05.238 --> 00:30:07.678
It was special.

454
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:12.026
All those people from
all those different places.

455
00:30:12.158 --> 00:30:15.938
different lives.
everyone living together.

456
00:30:16.075 --> 00:30:18.075
For all the fear

457
00:30:18.207 --> 00:30:21.117
and all the
monsters-in-the-forest bullshit.

458
00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:23.214
there was something.

459
00:30:23.343 --> 00:30:25.263
there was a joy in that house.

460
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:32.087
For a little while. anyways.

461
00:30:32.221 --> 00:30:35.701
And. like most things.
none of us appreciated it

462
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.584
nearly as much as we should
have. and now it's fucking gone.

463
00:30:47.236 --> 00:30:48.366
I'm sorry.

464
00:30:50.283 --> 00:30:53.203
Yeah.

465
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:54.639
Me. too.

466
00:31:04.297 --> 00:31:07.947
Look. I'm gonna put
my game face

467
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:10.223
back on tomorrow.

468
00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.906
and we'll give
that tower a shot.

469
00:31:17.527 --> 00:31:21.047
But you have to be prepared for
the fallout if it doesn't work.

470
00:31:21.183 --> 00:31:23.233
And if it does work...

471
00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:29.495
I think you'll find there's
more you're gonna miss

472
00:31:29.626 --> 00:31:31.446
about this place
than you thought.

473
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:40.460
♪

474
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:50.945
That kinda day. huh?

475
00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:58.094
Just ironing out a few wrinkles.
that's all.

476
00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.090
Yeah.

477
00:31:59.221 --> 00:32:01.091
Where's Jade?

478
00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:06.623
He's. uh...
I don't know.

479
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.190
Okay?

480
00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:10.187
Donna did a number
on the floor.

481
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.279
Yeah.

482
00:32:12.408 --> 00:32:14.278
She knows how to wield an axe.
I'll give her that.

483
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:26.245
Well. better
get back to it.

484
00:32:26.379 --> 00:32:29.509
So. we got that coil
for the CB that you needed.

485
00:32:29.643 --> 00:32:32.123
and we should have enough
wire stripped for the cord.

486
00:32:32.254 --> 00:32:34.084
That's great.

487
00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:35.393
Is it?

488
00:32:35.518 --> 00:32:38.428
Well. yeah.
I mean. look.

489
00:32:38.565 --> 00:32:40.915
I'm not gonna stand here and
pretend that it was a great day.

490
00:32:41.046 --> 00:32:44.566
These are setbacks.
nothing more.

491
00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:47.011
Look. you got what we
need for the radio.

492
00:32:47.139 --> 00:32:50.359
tower's almost finished.
and I'm gonna figure this out.

493
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.190
How?

494
00:32:52.318 --> 00:32:54.758
Well. that
I don't know.

495
00:32:54.885 --> 00:32:58.105
But one thing you learn as an
engineer: there's always a way.

496
00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:01.239
We will figure this out.

497
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:33.491
Hey.

498
00:33:36.623 --> 00:33:38.193
Hey.

499
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.110
Are you okay?

500
00:33:43.543 --> 00:33:46.853
Eric was a friend.

501
00:33:47.677 --> 00:33:50.327
Oh God. I'm...
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:50.463 --> 00:33:52.163
I-I didn't know that
you guys were close.

503
00:33:54.989 --> 00:33:57.909
He had celiac disease.

504
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.466
so he came to the clinic a lot.

505
00:34:00.603 --> 00:34:04.353
He was always bloated
and dehydrated.

506
00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:06.607
I kept telling him
to stop eating bread.

507
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.480
But he always said things like.
"I'm already in shitsville.

508
00:34:10.613 --> 00:34:13.703
"now you want me
to give up carbs?"

509
00:34:13.834 --> 00:34:16.104
He just had this way
about him. you know?

510
00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:19.358
He was one of the people that.
when I first got here. he...

511
00:34:22.408 --> 00:34:23.448
just made it a lot easier.

512
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:30.718
And now he's gone. so...

513
00:34:38.554 --> 00:34:40.564
Hey. Kristi...

514
00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:44.727
Look. I know you've had
a hard time lately.

515
00:34:44.865 --> 00:34:48.085
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody.

516
00:34:48.216 --> 00:34:50.476
and you feel like it's
your responsibility now--

517
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.570
Kristi. I--

518
00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:56.309
But I just need you
to promise me. okay?

519
00:34:56.442 --> 00:35:00.712
If it falls apart.
if you fall apart.

520
00:35:00.837 --> 00:35:04.927
just promise me.
you'll come to me.

521
00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:07.239
you'll talk to me.

522
00:35:07.366 --> 00:35:09.106
you'll let me help.

523
00:35:12.545 --> 00:35:14.235
I promise you.

524
00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:20.936
Hey. I promise you.

525
00:35:21.075 --> 00:35:24.425
Come here.
Come on.

526
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.300
It's okay.

527
00:35:35.568 --> 00:35:37.698
People just don't
understand what it's like.

528
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:41.361
I mean. it's not like
you can take a nickel

529
00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:44.837
and suddenly make it
worth 10 cents!

530
00:35:45.795 --> 00:35:47.615
Aw. it doesn't matter.
You know why?

531
00:35:47.754 --> 00:35:52.674
Because Jade is a genius.
Jade'll figure it out. You...

532
00:35:52.802 --> 00:35:54.152
Let me tell you something.

533
00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:56.592
you have no idea
how much pressure that is.

534
00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:57.939
to be the one that everybody

535
00:35:58.068 --> 00:36:01.988
just assumes can fix a...

536
00:36:02.116 --> 00:36:03.676
an unfixable problem!

537
00:36:03.813 --> 00:36:07.563
Oh. and then...

538
00:36:07.687 --> 00:36:09.467
then. you've got
Mr. Tea Cups sauntering in

539
00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:14.432
with his big white horse
and his blue eyes and his.

540
00:36:14.563 --> 00:36:18.393
"Oh. don't smoke weed.
you degenerate."

541
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:22.529
Fine. fine.
You know what? Fine.

542
00:36:22.658 --> 00:36:24.438
You think you can fix this?
Go ahead! Fix it!

543
00:36:24.573 --> 00:36:27.533
I'm just dying
to see how it's done. Ha!

544
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:30.541
You so much complain!

545
00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:33.316
Complain. complain!

546
00:36:33.452 --> 00:36:35.062
Stop complain!

547
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:37.413
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

548
00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:40.203
You need electric?

549
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:42.497
Yeah.

550
00:36:55.604 --> 00:37:00.174
The problem is you can't
plug anything in.

551
00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:01.865
I mean. it'd be one thing
if it was just.

552
00:37:02.002 --> 00:37:05.572
you know. like a pan we
could throw on the stove.

553
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:07.531
God knows.

554
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.230
whatever's coming up through
those wires is still...

555
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:20.891
Holy shit.
I know how to do it.

556
00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:26.724
Hello?

557
00:37:26.853 --> 00:37:30.383
We're down here!

558
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:34.431
Hi.

559
00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:36.466
How did it go
with the tower?

560
00:37:36.602 --> 00:37:37.692
Uh. good.

561
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.650
I think things are
really shaping up.

562
00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:42.739
You're a pretty bad liar.

563
00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:45.569
Thanks.
I'll add that to the list.

564
00:37:45.698 --> 00:37:48.348
It's gonna work.

565
00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:55.491
The tower.
it's gonna work.

566
00:37:55.621 --> 00:37:57.451
What's got you
feeling so optimistic?

567
00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.929
I don't know.

568
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.630
I was just thinking about
something Ethan said.

569
00:38:02.758 --> 00:38:04.758
What was that?

570
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:06.811
What if we were
supposed to come here?

571
00:38:06.936 --> 00:38:08.676
I don't know. it's weird. but...

572
00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:12.548
back home.
we never talked anymore.

573
00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:13.681
We just...

574
00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:16.563
And now.
we're together again.

575
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:18.555
like. we're really together.

576
00:38:18.687 --> 00:38:21.727
And it's...

577
00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:23.694
it's like Fatima said to me
on my first night.

578
00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:26.523
"If you climb up high enough.

579
00:38:26.652 --> 00:38:28.392
even a nightmare can
look like a dream."

580
00:38:28.523 --> 00:38:30.353
Wise words.

581
00:38:33.528 --> 00:38:37.708
So. how about you forget about
your tower for a little while

582
00:38:37.837 --> 00:38:39.617
and come help us dig our hole?

583
00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:43.317
Deal.

584
00:38:56.595 --> 00:39:03.465
♪

585
00:39:11.087 --> 00:39:13.737
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

586
00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:16.753
Hey. it's okay.
It's okay. Come on.

587
00:39:19.095 --> 00:39:21.875
It's okay.
It's okay. Come on.

588
00:39:22.011 --> 00:39:23.621
There.
There. there you go.

589
00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:25.752
There you go.

590
00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:27.665
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.

591
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.670
Where are we?

592
00:39:32.805 --> 00:39:34.545
Don't worry. We're safe.

593
00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:39.807
Is that...?

594
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:41.642
Oh. yeah.

595
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.560
I. uh...
finally managed to get one down.

596
00:39:45.687 --> 00:39:48.687
and. uh... this was inside.

597
00:39:50.736 --> 00:39:52.556
What does it say?

598
00:39:52.694 --> 00:39:54.524
1864.

599
00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:57.794
That's it.

600
00:39:57.917 --> 00:40:00.787
And. from what I could tell.

601
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.750
every bottle up there seems
to have a slip of paper

602
00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:04.658
just like this.

603
00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:07.665
I think we should go back.

604
00:40:08.797 --> 00:40:11.887
What?

605
00:40:12.018 --> 00:40:13.758
The voice I heard.

606
00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:16.629
it was different this time.

607
00:40:16.762 --> 00:40:20.642
It was a woman and...

608
00:40:20.766 --> 00:40:22.546
and she was screaming.

609
00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:24.551
She said--

610
00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:29.822
She said that she was wrong.

611
00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:33.609
that we shouldn't have come.
that there are things out here

612
00:40:33.735 --> 00:40:35.815
that are worse
than the monsters.

613
00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:38.825
She kept saying...

614
00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:40.868
What?
She kept saying what?

615
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:43.833
I don't know.

616
00:40:43.963 --> 00:40:47.273
It doesn't make any sense.

617
00:40:47.401 --> 00:40:48.751
She kept saying.

618
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:50.671
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

619
00:40:50.796 --> 00:40:52.446
that I was wrong."

620
00:40:54.843 --> 00:40:57.283
What?

621
00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:04.638
What is that?

622
00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:05.766
I don't know.

623
00:41:22.088 --> 00:41:23.658
What's happening?

624
00:41:23.785 --> 00:41:25.305
I don't know.

625
00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:43.018
There's drawings of scarecrows

626
00:41:43.152 --> 00:41:45.072
and bogeymen. giant spiders.

627
00:41:45.198 --> 00:41:47.508
This is definitely a quest.

628
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:53.771
What is it?

629
00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:55.952
Keep digging. keep digging!

630
00:41:56.078 --> 00:41:57.688
I think I hit the bottom.

631
00:41:57.819 --> 00:41:58.909
Oh. my God.

632
00:41:59.038 --> 00:41:59.728
Here. here.
Let me help.

633
00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:01.815
Hey!

634
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:06.646
Get in!

635
00:42:12.965 --> 00:42:14.655
Are you-- are you--

636
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.854
Hey. where's the talisman?

637
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:34.677
W-where's the talisman?

638
00:42:34.813 --> 00:42:35.773
Here!

639
00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:51.916
We shouldn't have come here.

640
00:42:52.047 --> 00:42:53.697
Shh!

641
00:42:53.832 --> 00:42:56.622
We're okay. We're okay.

642
00:42:56.748 --> 00:42:58.708
No.

643
00:42:58.837 --> 00:43:00.577
I don't think we are.
