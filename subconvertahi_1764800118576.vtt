2
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.820
I sense you. brother.

3
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.520
Hiding...

4
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.890
...Behind your cloak.

5
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960
It is time to earn yours.

6
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.320
Still too small to take me head on.

7
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.180
Use the cave!

8
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.250
You fight with rage.

9
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.030
I fight like father.

10
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.030
You are not father. you are Dek!

11
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.970
Do you yield?

12
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.310
Never!

13
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.230
Good.

14
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.870
I'm still alive. brother.

15
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.160
Still much to prove...

16
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.750
...to show who you are.

17
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.690
I am Yautja.

18
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.500
Not yet.

19
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.010
Are you holding your sword. Kwei?

20
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.980
No.

21
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.060
Pick it up!

22
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.330
You kept this toy?!

23
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.310
You remember what happened...

24
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.520
I lost my fang!

25
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.990
And you saved my life.

26
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.130
You protected me.

27
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.190
Come here.

28
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.420
Fixed it for you.

29
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.710
Don't blow yourself up.

30
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.340
Today you make a vow...

31
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.230
...as our ancestors did before you.

32
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.760
To earn your place in the clan...

33
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.260
...you must choose your prey.

34
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.190
Bring it home...

35
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.060
...or never return.

36
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.550
Wait — Go back!

37
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.300
Genna.

38
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.240
The death planet.

39
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.670
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

40
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.810
Even father fears it.

41
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

42
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.610
Father calls me the weakest...

43
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.710
...so I must kill the strongest.

44
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.430
Failure means death.

45
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.240
Then I will not fail.

46
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.350
I cannot allow it.

47
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.470
I make my vow.

48
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.110
I make my vow!

49
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.660
Father.

50
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.470
I welcome you with honor.

51
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.090
Why is it not done?

52
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.410
He deserves a hunt.

53
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.720
He is our clan's weakness....

54
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.180
...weaknesses must be culled.

55
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.040
He will bring home the Kalisk.

56
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.670
Foolishness.

57
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.670
He is a runt.

58
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.070
You should have done it as he slept.

59
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.930
Kill him!

60
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.990
Now!

61
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.450
He will only honor us in death.

62
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.940
Father.

63
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.860
Kwei?

64
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.220
Be brave. brother.

65
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.330
Father!

66
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.870
Kwei!!!

67
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.200
To forgive weakness...

68
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.840
...is to show weakness.

69
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.040
No! Father. no!

70
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.840
Get your sword!

71
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.490
Kwei!!!

72
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.650
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

73
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.000
Bring it home.

74
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.540
Bring it home.

75
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.160
For Kwei.

76
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.790
Yautja!

77
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.710
Yautja hunt alone.

78
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.960
What happened to your legs?

79
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.460
You have you seen the Kalisk?

80
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.780
Useful...

81
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.570
...like tool?

82
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.900
I will use you. tool.

83
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.120
Don't want flies.

84
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.660
Name is Dek.

85
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.910
Now talk that way.

86
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.750
How long have you been here?

87
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.970
Who would come?

88
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.970
Sensitivity is weakness.

89
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.030
I must eat.

90
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.840
What is this creature?

91
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:24.190
Then it will be my food. too.

92
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.990
Quiet tool!

93
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.580
You give up too easily.

94
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.850
Kalisk?

95
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.390
You give up too easily.

96
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:17.430
When I pierced its head with my sword

97
00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.540
and its blood rushed down my face.

98
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.860
This flesh is not sweet.

99
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.990
I have no clan!

100
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.590
No clan.

101
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.240
I had a brother.

102
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.650
Father killed him.

103
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.960
Grief is weakness.

104
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.590
I am here for Kalisk.

105
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.980
Why are you here?

106
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.150
You should be able to survive on your own.

107
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.360
Tessa is your sister.

108
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:09.350
And legs.

109
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.410
Finding your sister

110
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.910
And legs.

111
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.940
The sun rises.

112
00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:42.820
Let's go.

113
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.510
Yautja hunt alone.

114
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.550
You're a tool.

115
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:14.070
We're not in the tree now.

116
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.290
Kalisk?

117
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.750
It drinks here.

118
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.910
It drinks here?

119
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.580
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

120
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:59.680
My brother was protecting me.

121
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.540
The clan can have no weakness.

122
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.840
I will show them strength.

123
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.170
Wolf

124
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.250
This alpha must be a great killer.

125
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.790
I will hunt it too.

126
00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:59.810
I see...

127
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:06.610
But I will be the alpha that kills the most.

128
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.980
The Kalish's den?

129
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:13.210
Who are they?

130
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.580
Easier to walk now.

131
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.090
No.

132
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.810
Easier for me to walk now.

133
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.240
I too will remember this...

134
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:43.190
...today I become Dek of the Yautja.

135
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.280
I will honor Kwei...

136
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:51.230
When I bring the Kalisk home.

137
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.390
Then I take revenge.

138
00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.970
You will be the first to see my trophy.

139
00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.620
It is a great honor.

140
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.020
For you.

141
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.320
What?

142
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.000
I came here for the Kalisk.

143
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.580
You want my trophy.

144
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.350
Where is the Kalisk?

145
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:52.000
I use you. tool. You do not use me!

146
00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.300
I use you!

147
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.550
Where is the Kalisk?

148
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:17.910
Then my death will be honorable.

149
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.710
Call your sister.

150
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:28.750
None can stop me.

151
00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:56.450
Save yourself. tool!

152
01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.720
Tool. get these off!

153
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.560
You are not Thia.

154
01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.050
Release me!

155
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.820
You are another broken tool!

156
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.850
Remove these!

157
01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:47.600
Or I'll rip out your spine and crush your skull!

158
01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:02.090
You are nothing. A device.

159
01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.040
Made by others to do their work for them.

160
01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:23.350
You betrayed me!

161
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:55.440
I trusted you.

162
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.770
Don't like these tools.

163
01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:06.000
I'm sorry. My Sister is —

164
01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.430
Don't like sister either.

165
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.850
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

166
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.680
He's asking about the device.

167
01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.620
It's a children's toy.

168
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:38.950
But say it's a map.

169
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.140
Tell tool to look inside.

170
01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:01.400
That was a toy for children?

171
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:02.680
Yautja children!

172
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:10.210
Run. Dek!

173
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:14.620
Go...Go!

174
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:28.510
<i>Enter destination coordinates. Kwei.</i>

175
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.760
You saved me. brother.

176
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:12.840
Wolf.

177
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.350
Kalisk.

178
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.710
Kalisk child.

179
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.190
I came to rescue you.

180
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:57.590
Wolf.

181
01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:06.500
Bone Bison.

182
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.580
Not yet...

183
01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:21.300
Thia

184
01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.240
Kalisk!

185
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.760
Kalish child!

186
01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.980
They have her mother!

187
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:13.870
You free the Kalish.

188
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.720
I get my trophy.

189
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:12.130
You tell me.

190
01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:03.520
That's not yours.

191
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.120
Not yet.

192
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:35.030
You've come here for revenge?

193
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:38.670
I've come for my cloak.

194
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:44.550
What is this?

195
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:47.750
I've completed my hunt.

196
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:50.780
That is my trophy.

197
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:53.900
You disgrace our clan...

198
01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.640
And so did Kwei.

199
01:34:58.330 --> 01:35:01.190
Get rid of him.

200
01:36:55.890 --> 01:37:00.500
Perhaps the right son did survive.

201
01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.860
Yield now...

202
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:06.650
...and take your place in our clan.

203
01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:11.060
I have my own clan.

204
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.580
No.

205
01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.640
It's my mother.

205
01:38:38.305 --> 01:39:38.931
