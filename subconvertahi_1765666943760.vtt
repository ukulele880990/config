[officer speaks Russian]

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.633
[announcer 2 speaking Russian

[in English] Okay.

13
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.537
Hey. uh. they just pulled me
out of the security line.

14
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.206
And. uh. they're going
through my bag right now. Oh. shit.

15
00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:49.795
I-I uploaded. um.
some of the files to the drafts folders

16
00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:52.798
so they should
be coming through now. But… Fuck.

17
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.425
Wait. They took my computer.

18
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.759
Hey. um… That's…

19
00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.971
- [officer arguing in Russian]
- I need my computer. That's…

20
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.473
I'm a journalist
and I can't work without my computer.

21
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.891
I'm gonna miss my plane.
I need to get back to New Yo--

22
00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.270
- Stop! You're hurting me.
- [officer speaking Russian]

23
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.437
[in English]
Where are you taking me? I'm a journalist.

24
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.314
Stop it! Stop!

25
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.651
[John] Thanks for sharing this. Alex.

26
00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:17.990
They claim they found
a suspicious hard drive in her luggage.

27
00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.116
What's the State Department saying?

28
00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.620
Oh. they're reviewing her case to see
if she qualifies as unlawfully detained.

29
00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:24.704
It could take weeks.

30
00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.998
The Belarusians
haven't charged her officially.

31
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.626
But what does that mean?
Char-Charged with what?

32
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.378
Espionage. Conspiracy against the state.
It could be anything.

33
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.965
Espionage? She was chasing a story.

34
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.259
What story?

35
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.304
Something that happened before the merger.

36
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.889
[stammers] A pollution cover-up in Ohio.

37
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.182
A place called Wolf River.

38
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.519
[Ben stammers] If the story's in Ohio.
what's she doing in Belarus?

39
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:50.229
[Alex] She was meeting a source. Someone
who worked for the chemical company.

40
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.399
I don't… I don't have all the details

41
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.319
because she and Chip were
still putting all the pieces together.

42
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.944
[stammers] Wait. Chip Black?

43
00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:01.157
Oh. God. She asked for institutional
support and cover for her travel.

44
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.783
And I said no.

45
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.245
Uh… [sighs] This isn't your fault.

46
00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.997
You… There's no way you could've known.

47
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.792
All right. What is happening?
Do… Am I getting on a plane?

48
00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:14.212
Uh… The last thing we need
is more eyes on this.

49
00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.963
We have to go through
the State Department.

50
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.009
If this blows up.
it'll only be harder to get her back.

51
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.762
We need to talk about news coverage.

52
00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.016
[stammers] I know.
but this is going to leak at some point.

53
00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:29.394
And we need to be ready to run something.
Also. what do we tell staff?

54
00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:30.646
Nothing yet.

55
00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.146
Not until we know more.

56
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.106
I'll speak to the State Department.

57
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:37.069
And I wanna see any
Bradley Jackson package before it runs.

58
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.862
Nothing goes out until we're ready.

59
00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:41.865
- Okay.
- [Ben] Of course.

60
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.620
Okay. we'll figure it out.

61
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.331
Oh. I'll call you back.

62
00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:50.831
Hey. Quick question.

63
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.043
You should've stayed gone. You were free.

64
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.254
- Well. then I wouldn't get to bother you.
- [chuckles]

65
00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.173
So. why is Chris on call for TMS all week?

66
00:04:58.257 --> 00:05:00.091
I was supposed to have her clear
for the next few days.

67
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.927
Oh. someone should've told Bradley.

68
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.011
Why? What's she doing?

69
00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:04.303
She's sick.

70
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.473
So sick she couldn't even send a text.

71
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.350
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Ben said to roll with it.

72
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.187
I'm about to roll my ass
to the bar if you wanna get a drink.

73
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.312
[scoffs]

74
00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.276
I don't care if it's unconfirmed.

75
00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:20.653
Just on background. give…
give me your best guess.

76
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.740
[sighs]

77
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.452
All right. all right.
Thanks. I appreciate it.

78
00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.163
- Oh. God.
- What?

79
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.540
[sighs] They're gonna press charges
against Bradley.

80
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.002
- [sighing] Oh. shit.
- I'm gonna fucking throw up.

81
00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.420
[stammers] Lying to
government officials. at a minimum.

82
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.841
My friend at the IMF said that they're
planning to move her end of day tomorrow.

83
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.218
- Alex. if that happens--
- Yeah. I know.

84
00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.971
And everybody that I've been speaking to
in D.C. is saying just what Celine says.

85
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.723
which is just let
the State Department handle it.

86
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.893
I-I just started going through
the documents Bradley sent over.

87
00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.687
So we don't know what-what she found.

88
00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:55.605
We don't know what they think she found.

89
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.356
And if Belarus says
that this is espionage…

90
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.735
Exactly. I mean. these are the people
that dragged an activist off a plane.

91
00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.572
Their-Their top ally locked up
that Wall Street Journal reporter

92
00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:04.697
and threw away the key.

93
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:09.076
If we don't get her back now. she
could be locked up for fucking years.

94
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.288
Okay. What are we
not thinking of. Chip? Come on.

95
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.456
[stammers] Who are we not thinking of?

96
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.418
Who could help? Come on.
There's gotta be somebody we can call.

97
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.920
- [sighs]
- Okay. look. uh…

98
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.213
Belarus is like Russia. right?

99
00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:21.964
[stammers]
It's a shit show run by oligarchs.

100
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:26.512
So we need someone who can
interface with the actual power brokers.

101
00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.682
You have an idea.

102
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.189
Um… No. I don't.

103
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:38.814
Yes. you do. Yes.

104
00:06:41.108 --> 00:06:43.569
Fuck me. [breathes heavily]

105
00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.574
What?

106
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.471
[sighs]

107
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.365
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

108
00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:32.827
You said it was an emergency.

109
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.413
Come on. Sit down.

110
00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:36.206
Talk to me.

111
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.375
What can I do for you?

112
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.172
Bradley's being detained in Belarus.

113
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.634
- What?
- I know how you feel about her. I do.

114
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:50.095
But. Paul. I really need your help.

115
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.432
Well. she's on-air talent.
I mean. she's way too high-profile.

116
00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.683
- They're gonna let her go.
- They're about to file charges.

117
00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:58.353
- What do you want me to do about it?
- There's someone you know who could--

118
00:07:58.437 --> 00:07:59.771
- [Amanda] Alex Levy.
- [sighs]

119
00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:02.815
Every time I see your highlights
I know the sky's about to fall.

120
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.567
Can you just give us
a couple minutes. please?

121
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.112
I… I'm in between meetings.
And I have an event tonight. so…

122
00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:10.449
Okay. If I wanted
to get in touch with Dmitri Ivanov…

123
00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:11.533
Jesus. Alex.

124
00:08:11.617 --> 00:08:13.535
Or maybe you could talk to him

125
00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:17.372
and see if he would be willing to lean on
some government official to release her?

126
00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:22.084
You want me to broker a deal
with a sanctioned Russian oligarch?

127
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.545
Go through the White House.

128
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:25.672
Or-Or better yet.
call your friend Celine Dumont.

129
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.882
Her whole family owns half of France.

130
00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.050
She must know someone.

131
00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.761
She's deferring to the State Department.

132
00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.013
- Paul.
- One… One second.

133
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.264
Trust me. Paul. I hate this.

134
00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.476
I hate that I have to come here
and ask for your help.

135
00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:39.894
I really do. I'm very sorry.

136
00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:43.065
But all they keep telling me
is that I have to sit tight

137
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.942
and be patient
and let the professionals handle it.

138
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.568
But they're not handling it.

139
00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:51.114
And if she gets thrown in prison
and stuck there. it's my fault.

140
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.908
You're not the reason she's over there.

141
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.451
Well. I am. Essentially.

142
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.788
- More or less.
- [whispers] God.

143
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.836
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.922
Alex… [stammers]
…there's nothing I can do.

145
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:10.299
Yeah.

146
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.471
[sighs] Okay.

147
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.558
- [clicks tongue] Bye. Thanks. Bye.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:28.067
- You cannot get involved with her.
- I know. I know.

149
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.284
[Marcus] I know this is gonna be hard.

150
00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.287
I couldn't do this without you.

151
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.501
We can watch it later together.
You. me. and Naima.

152
00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:46.961
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.592
- I love you.
- I love you too.

154
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.846
- [sighs]
- Ready?

155
00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.974
- Let's do this.
- [chuckles]

156
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:09.692
These medals represent
integrity. sportsmanship and excellence.

157
00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:14.447
And I'm proud to finally be able
to give them to their rightful owner.

158
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.620
Elaine. these belong to you.

159
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.710
[staff chattering]

160
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:31.631
In celebration of your achievement.

161
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:32.841
[chatter continues]

162
00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:36.302
Thank you. This is an incredible honor.

163
00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:37.971
- Can I? [chuckles]
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:46.855
Um… Oh. thank you
for understanding. for accepting.

165
00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:51.067
And. um… they look good on you.

166
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.693
[both chuckle]

167
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.447
Uh. we will be right back
after this break.

168
00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:05.206
[Celine] Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

169
00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:08.376
I'm sure you understand
time is of the essence.

170
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.046
Of course. Um. I do want to say that

171
00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.923
Alex gave us the go-ahead
to investigate this story.

172
00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:17.552
So if there's any question of liability.
or UBN's legal exposure--

173
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.803
[Celine] There isn't.

174
00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.681
Bradley is one of ours.

175
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:24.225
Why don't you start from the beginning?
How did you get onto the story?

176
00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:26.477
Well. Bradley got a tip
from an old colleague.

177
00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:28.187
She was busy on The Morning Show.

178
00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:30.774
so I said I would go to Ohio
and do some legwork.

179
00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.025
We eventually made contact with a source.

180
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.320
Someone from inside Martel Chemical.

181
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.655
And she said
she would only meet face-to-face. so…

182
00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.075
- This source…
- [Chip] Mm-hmm.

183
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.034
She's a whistle-blower?

184
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.745
Uh. I mean. that's what we assumed. Yeah.

185
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.248
But you're not sure?

186
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.254
Uh. I mean. she was a little cagey. but…

187
00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.090
What if she's not a whistle-blower at all?

188
00:11:56.258 --> 00:11:57.466
What if she set you up?

189
00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.928
This woman told Bradley
to come to a hostile country.

190
00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:02.306
She did.

191
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.764
And now she's been taken.

192
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:05.558
Bad luck?

193
00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.020
Or was that her plan all along?

194
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:10.688
What? Uh. hold on.

195
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.524
That's not what happened.

196
00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.902
Did Bradley actually meet with her?

197
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:17.361
In the video she mentioned some files.

198
00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:23.869
Look. if she did send something.
um. I wouldn't be able to share it.

199
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.245
Not without Bradley's permission.

200
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.750
I think. given the circumstances.
she might make an exception.

201
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.711
Well. uh. nothing came through. you know.

202
00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:37.048
There was the. uh. video from the airport

203
00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:40.259
that went to the cloud
but that-that's… that's it.

204
00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.303
Sure.

205
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.849
Just let us know
if you think of anything else.

206
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.350
Absolutely. I will.

207
00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.312
[elevator dings]

208
00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.880
[people chattering]

209
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:41.738
- Hey.
- Hey.

210
00:13:41.822 --> 00:13:42.822
What are you doing?

211
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:46.284
Uh. Bradley asked me to come by
to just. uh. grab some stuff for her. so…

212
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.786
- Oh. Great. You talked to her.
- Yeah.

213
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.288
- She's feeling better?
- Uh. yeah.

214
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.956
Yeah. I mean.
she's not out of the woods yet.

215
00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:53.000
but she's… you know. she's getting there.

216
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.919
- [chuckles]
- What… What's up?

217
00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.131
I don't know. I'm just wondering
why. if Bradley is sick.

218
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:03.092
people keep coming around here
digging through her dressing room?

219
00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:05.345
Peop… What? Like Celine's people?

220
00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:08.014
I don't know. Maybe.

221
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.474
Yeah. yeah.

222
00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.854
What do you. uh. think of her?

223
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.190
- Celine?
- Yeah.

224
00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:17.816
Uh…

225
00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:22.111
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.

226
00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.240
Yeah. I'm starting to feel the same way.

227
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.120
Anyway. I should probably get going.
It's good seeing you.

228
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.746
- Yeah. it's been… Well…
- Uh… yeah.

229
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.540
Bradley's not sick.

230
00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:35.834
What's going on. Chip?

231
00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:39.629
I don't… I don't know what you mean.

232
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.130
Okay.
Well. then maybe I'll go up to Celine

233
00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:43.591
and tell her that I found you
digging around in Bradley's dressing room.

234
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:44.927
Yeah. you wouldn't do that.

235
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.386
I just leveraged
the Head of News for a pod deal.

236
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:49.514
My villain era is in full swing.

237
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.183
So?

238
00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:57.605
[phone buzzing]

239
00:14:58.356 --> 00:14:59.524
[inhales sharply]

240
00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:04.196
[groans]

241
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.573
[grunts]

242
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.331
Cory Ellison's office.

243
00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.250
[Celine] Did you just wake up?

244
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:21.963
[grunts] Well. I felt winter coming.
so I thought I'd try hibernating.

245
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.130
It didn't work.

246
00:15:23.215 --> 00:15:24.924
I don't know how the bears do it.

247
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.677
Ah. no more cocaine for you.

248
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.847
Aw. That was the best part of my week.

249
00:15:31.807 --> 00:15:33.933
Has anyone come to check on you?

250
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.479
Have you heard from any friends?

251
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.273
Just you.

252
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.610
Nice to hear another voice.

253
00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:45.696
[clicks tongue]

254
00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:48.907
You were funny the other night.

255
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.366
[chuckles]

256
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.245
And you were fun. Thanks.

257
00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.538
Are you feeling any better?

258
00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.000
Not sure I'm feeling anything.

259
00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.668
You shouldn't be alone. Not now.

260
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.462
Well. then I should've made
different life choices.

261
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.215
Ugh. Fuck.

262
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.134
Self-pity.

263
00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.386
The least interesting of all the pities.

264
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.806
Don't be so hard on yourself.

265
00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:15.433
You're mourning.

266
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.936
It's funny. though. you know.
I was with her.

267
00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.020
I was there.

268
00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:21.856
And… I still don't really believe it.

269
00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:25.027
Her lawyer dropped by a box of shit.

270
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.778
and he was all solemn and.

271
00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:30.323
"Mr. Ellison. I'm sorry for your loss.
She was a good woman."

272
00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.743
And I thought. "Who in the fuck
is he talking about?

273
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.495
My mom is in Greenwich.
She's fine. She's doing…"

274
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.038
I'm coming over.

275
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.790
Hey. You don't have to do that.

276
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.293
I'll bring you dinner.

277
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:44.046
You can talk about her
till you're green in the face.

278
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.297
Blue.

279
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.174
Blue in the face.

280
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.842
Yeah. Blue.

281
00:16:53.764 --> 00:16:55.097
[sighs]

282
00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.856
- [elevator dings]
- [door opens]

283
00:17:08.237 --> 00:17:09.363
Hey.

284
00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:12.950
I just found a document
in the reports that Bradley sent.

285
00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:14.785
And one of them is from Wolf River.

286
00:17:18.453 --> 00:17:20.332
- Chip?
- Just roll with me.

287
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.875
André is four hours outside of Minsk.

288
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.252
He'll help with Bradley
as soon as he's on the ground.

289
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.507
I know everything.

290
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.093
Well. you got me beat.

291
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.469
[phone buzzes]

292
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.637
Uh… One second.

293
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.722
Hey. What do you got for me?

294
00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:39.977
Can we please talk?

295
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.145
I should've made sure
you got Head of News like I promised.

296
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.230
[Mia] So why didn't you?

297
00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:48.734
Because I was focused
on advertising dollars and sponsors

298
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:53.448
and proving that I could do this executive
job that I fought so hard to get.

299
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:54.740
And…

300
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.660
I'm just so sorry.

301
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.161
Well. you should be.

302
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.334
But…

303
00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.461
- thank you.
- [phone buzzes]

304
00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.425
Hello?

305
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.051
I talked to Ivanov.

306
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.721
We're going to the opera.

307
00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:18.640
[gasps]

308
00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.643
[Paul] Dmitri Ivanov almost
closed a deal with a friend of mine.

309
00:18:21.727 --> 00:18:24.104
but he was sanctioned
before it went through.

310
00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:28.525
He's a piece of work.
but he has real influence in Minsk.

311
00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.611
And he has two soft spots…

312
00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.405
his Russian mistress and Puccini.

313
00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.240
As it so happens.

314
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:39.786
an acclaimed soprano is doing
a series of recitals here in New York.

315
00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:43.539
I've arranged to fly him in
as my guest for the night.

316
00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:45.541
I'll make introductions during the concert

317
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.295
and then
you can talk to him about Bradley.

318
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.838
[Alex] What does he want in exchange?

319
00:18:50.923 --> 00:18:53.049
[Paul] His mistress Nadzeya is an actress

320
00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.510
whose series
has been put on indefinite hiatus

321
00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:57.429
because of the situation in Ukraine.

322
00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.265
Maybe you can be of some help.

323
00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:03.268
With any luck. he'll make some calls.
talk to his friends in the government.

324
00:19:03.352 --> 00:19:05.436
and we can start working on a solution.

325
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:09.482
Obviously.
no one can know we're doing this.

326
00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:13.403
We'll arrive separately.
keep as little contact as possible.

327
00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.948
And you should bring a date.

328
00:19:24.373 --> 00:19:25.457
[Mia sighs] Okay.

329
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.210
André's at Minsk airport.
ready and waiting.

330
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.377
[Alex] Okay.

331
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:30.711
You all right?

332
00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:32.588
I'm a little nervous.

333
00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:34.132
I don't see why.

334
00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.385
It-It's just a secret rendezvous
with my ex-boyfriend.

335
00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.762
making a deal with a sanctioned oligarch.

336
00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:43.851
trying to keep our friend from being
thrown indefinitely into a foreign prison.

337
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.644
Well. when you say it like that.

338
00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.938
- No big deal. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

339
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.022
[gentle music plays]

340
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:55.528
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen.
welcome to this evening's performance.

341
00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.990
We kindly ask you to take your seats.
The show will begin shortly.

342
00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.157
[Alex] There he is.

343
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.207
Where's Ivanov?

344
00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.842
[opera singer singing]

345
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.140
[singing continues]

346
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.199
What is going on with you and Miles?

347
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.284
[Celine scoffs]

348
00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:28.079
[chuckles] You mean are we still together?

349
00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.457
Well. yeah. But I mean…

350
00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:36.838
I've always just wondered
what it is about him for you.

351
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:39.423
'Cause you could have anyone.

352
00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:41.218
[chuckles]

353
00:21:42.094 --> 00:21:44.011
- Could I?
- Um…

354
00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:45.596
[jazz music playing]

355
00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.101
Why do you ask?

356
00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.019
I'm curious.

357
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.896
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:56.525
Um…

359
00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:01.195
There's something that ties us together.

360
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:05.867
Even when we're apart.
even when he breaks me.

361
00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.579
I try to hate him.

362
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.664
I try to let him go.

363
00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:17.211
But I can't because I'm weak.

364
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:21.465
And… [sighs]

365
00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:24.760
[chuckles] I don't want to be alone.

366
00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:29.182
I think if it was me.

367
00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:32.810
I wouldn't have gone behind your back.

368
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:40.109
I think I would've done
everything in my power to keep you.

369
00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:43.779
[chuckles]

370
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:48.911
But you never made a move.

371
00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:54.583
In Los Angeles I could feel you circling.

372
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:56.667
Getting closer.

373
00:22:57.376 --> 00:23:01.173
But every time I looked. you stepped back.

374
00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:05.928
Did you ever imagine that?
What it would be like. you and me?

375
00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:11.307
It's crossed my mind.

376
00:23:12.017 --> 00:23:13.227
Me too.

377
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:18.773
[sighs]

378
00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:24.695
Um… [clears throat] When you imagine it.
what… what do you see?

379
00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:28.325
We're in bed.

380
00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:30.076
We never leave.

381
00:23:31.452 --> 00:23:33.288
We stay there day and night.

382
00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:37.041
And we fuck until we die of thirst.

383
00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.188
[both moaning]

384
00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:03.442
[phone buzzing]

385
00:24:06.571 --> 00:24:08.198
- [Cory groaning]
- [Celine panting]

386
00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:11.076
Michael. hey. Hi.

387
00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:12.618
[grunts]

388
00:24:13.537 --> 00:24:14.538
Yeah?

389
00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:17.583
White. They have to be white.
They have to be white.

390
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.002
No. there has to be 200.
That's what she wanted.

391
00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:26.008
Well. if she already ordered them.
then why in the fuck did you just call me?

392
00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:31.471
My mom's florist. She planned everything.

393
00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:34.182
I'm a fucking producer
and I've got nothing to produce.

394
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.727
- Cory.
- Yeah?

395
00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:37.935
It's okay.

396
00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:39.313
No. no. I'm fine. I…

397
00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:41.731
Really. It's okay. [chuckles]

398
00:24:49.698 --> 00:24:52.201
[chuckling]

399
00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:59.165
Oh. my head. [sniffles]

400
00:25:02.502 --> 00:25:03.503
[sniffles]

401
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:05.255
She was alone.

402
00:25:06.589 --> 00:25:09.300
She was alone in her house
the last days of her life.

403
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:14.890
And I was on a fucking movie set
playing make-believe.

404
00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.933
She wanted that for you.

405
00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.310
She wanted you to have everything.

406
00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:20.938
I don't know what she wanted.

407
00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:24.191
And I'll never get a chance to ask.

408
00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:26.484
All I have left is a fucking box.

409
00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:27.693
[sniffles]

410
00:25:27.778 --> 00:25:30.905
Totems for the sarcophagus.

411
00:25:35.786 --> 00:25:37.621
Do you want to look through it?

412
00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:40.749
We can do it together.

413
00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:42.584
[opera singer continues]

414
00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:01.854
[music stops]

415
00:26:01.936 --> 00:26:03.896
[crowd applauding. cheering]

416
00:26:14.407 --> 00:26:15.576
There they are.

417
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.077
All right. Let's go.

418
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:19.328
Yep. Let's go.

419
00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:22.624
- Thank you.
- It's great to see you again.

420
00:26:22.708 --> 00:26:24.250
[people chattering]

421
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:29.923
Paul.

422
00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:32.718
- [Paul] Alex.
- Hey.

423
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.470
- You remember Mia Jordan?
- [Paul] Of course. Hey. How are you?

424
00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:37.013
- Ready to do this?
- [Paul] All right.

425
00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:39.766
Uh. well. they're just waiting inside.

426
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:40.933
- Let's go.
- All right.

427
00:26:41.018 --> 00:26:42.560
[Paul] Uh. Dmitri. Nadzeya.

428
00:26:42.644 --> 00:26:46.522
Uh. allow me to introduce Alex Levy
and her colleague Mia Jordan.

429
00:26:46.606 --> 00:26:48.192
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure.

430
00:26:48.275 --> 00:26:50.359
We have a great appreciation
for your work.

431
00:26:50.443 --> 00:26:52.778
Oh. that's very kind. Likewise.

432
00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:55.615
And we saw your show. Nadzeya.
It was very compelling.

433
00:26:55.699 --> 00:26:57.326
The romance and the scale.

434
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:59.994
It's big. it's bold.
it's what everyone wants to see.

435
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.872
That is very kind of you.

436
00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:04.415
Mia's one of our biggest
producers at the network.

437
00:27:04.499 --> 00:27:06.125
And I have some great ideas.

438
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.211
I would love to talk to you
about it if you have a moment?

439
00:27:08.295 --> 00:27:10.087
Or I can just tell you
all my favorite scenes.

440
00:27:10.172 --> 00:27:11.589
- [Mia chuckles]
- [chuckles] Please.

441
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:14.092
- Why don't we step outside for a second?
- Yes. Of course.

442
00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:15.760
- Thank you.
- [Ivanov. Nadzeya chatter]

443
00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:18.763
[Ivanov] Ah. she is so happy.

444
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:21.517
But. you know. sometimes I feel like
she cares more for her work

445
00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:22.683
than she does for me.

446
00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:24.019
[chuckles] I know the feeling.

447
00:27:24.102 --> 00:27:26.771
Where is your lovely girlfriend tonight?

448
00:27:27.605 --> 00:27:31.067
Is she. uh. still saving the earth
from all the ravages of capitalism?

449
00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:33.319
[chuckles] I wouldn't know. Uh…

450
00:27:33.945 --> 00:27:35.404
We're no longer together.

451
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:40.410
Oh. Well. uh. things change
so quickly. don't they?

452
00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:42.119
Well. I'm glad you called me.

453
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:46.541
It was getting a bit cold out there.
being cut off from all the action. huh?

454
00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:49.670
- But. uh. you had a favor to ask.
- [Alex] Yes.

455
00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:51.712
I have a friend in Minsk.

456
00:27:51.797 --> 00:27:54.215
And she's. uh. an American journalist.

457
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:57.219
And there's been
a slight misunderstanding.

458
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:59.555
And she's stuck at an airport.

459
00:27:59.637 --> 00:28:03.474
No charges have been filed yet.
but we would really like

460
00:28:03.558 --> 00:28:08.020
to get her out of there before they decide
to make things more difficult.

461
00:28:08.105 --> 00:28:11.107
She doesn't have any ties to Belarus.

462
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.734
She's just a TV anchor chasing a story.

463
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:15.153
Mm-hmm.

464
00:28:15.237 --> 00:28:20.491
And you want… what?
You want me to negotiate her release?

465
00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:23.871
We would be really.
really appreciative if you could…

466
00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:25.122
if you would help us.

467
00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:28.291
All she has to do is walk down
a hallway and get on a plane.

468
00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:30.544
That is not possible.

469
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:32.587
Dmitri. all we're asking you to do
is make a phone call.

470
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:35.257
In the middle of the night? To the regime?

471
00:28:35.883 --> 00:28:36.884
[Paul sighs]

472
00:28:36.967 --> 00:28:38.594
That… What do you think is gonna happen?

473
00:28:38.676 --> 00:28:41.180
They're gonna grant your wish
and she's gonna come home?

474
00:28:41.805 --> 00:28:43.640
No. That… That's not how it works. That…

475
00:28:43.723 --> 00:28:46.101
It's a lot of calls. It's a lot of favors.

476
00:28:49.313 --> 00:28:50.314
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:52.523
[Paul stammers]
Uh. Dmitri. can you… [sighs]

478
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.401
What…

479
00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:58.322
- What was that?
- Yeah. just… Give me a sec.

480
00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.449
Let me… Let me…
Let me work on it and I'll…

481
00:29:00.531 --> 00:29:03.326
- Oh. God. Okay.
- All right. I'll. uh…

482
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.912
[Ivanov. in Russian]
There's a problem with the deal…

483
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:06.496
Then why did you bring me all this way?

484
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:09.958
I'm the one at risk.

485
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.127
[in English]
Uh. Mia. would you terribly mind. um…

486
00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:15.047
- Oh. of course.
- …giving us a few minutes?

487
00:29:17.007 --> 00:29:18.090
Thank you.

488
00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:20.719
[in Russian] If the Feds know I'm here.

489
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:22.136
you and I are going to have a big problem.

490
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:23.221
We should leave?

491
00:29:23.305 --> 00:29:25.265
Not quite yet.

492
00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:28.519
He has more to offer than a TV show…

493
00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:30.103
Really?

494
00:29:30.186 --> 00:29:32.146
What about my show? You promised me.

495
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.856
- Babe…
- Get off me!

496
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:36.527
- [Ivanov speaking Russian]
- Get off me!

497
00:29:37.277 --> 00:29:38.694
Stop touching me!

498
00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:42.281
[Alex sighs]

499
00:29:44.492 --> 00:29:46.202
[huffs. speaks English] Unbelievable.

500
00:29:46.286 --> 00:29:48.079
He said it's not possible.
He's not gonna help us.

501
00:29:48.163 --> 00:29:50.332
- He'll do it. He'll do it.
- I just spoke to him.

502
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:51.415
He can make a call.

503
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.627
He just needs something more
than a TV show for his side piece.

504
00:29:54.711 --> 00:29:56.212
[Alex] How do you know that?

505
00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:58.423
'Cause I just heard him fucking say it.

506
00:30:05.888 --> 00:30:07.140
- Senator. Hi.
- Hi.

507
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:08.558
- What?
- Come with me.

508
00:30:09.351 --> 00:30:11.394
- Where are we going?
- Okay. okay. Um…

509
00:30:11.478 --> 00:30:12.645
[announcer speaking]

510
00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:15.440
- Hello. Good evening.
- Come here. Come here.

511
00:30:15.523 --> 00:30:17.776
Where are we going. Alex?
What is happening?

512
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:19.361
Alex. what is going on?

513
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:22.573
Okay. Your friend… Your friend
that was making the deal with Ivanov.

514
00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:25.491
the one that fell through.
what was Ivanov after?

515
00:30:25.576 --> 00:30:27.076
Was it some kind of tech?

516
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.161
[sighs]

517
00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:29.538
AI software.

518
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:32.124
My friend is a direct
competitor in the space.

519
00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:34.542
We're both developing…
[stammers] …language protocols

520
00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:36.086
that can transform generative speech.

521
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:40.507
Okay. Well. Mia just overheard
him talking to his girlfriend

522
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.718
and he will make the call to Minsk.

523
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.760
He just wants more out of the deal.

524
00:30:44.845 --> 00:30:46.721
And maybe it's your software.

525
00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:49.016
Maybe that's what
he thought we were offering him.

526
00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:51.434
After he's been sanctioned
by the United States treasury?

527
00:30:51.518 --> 00:30:54.020
I don't… I… [chuckles]
He knows I would never do that.

528
00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:55.314
Oh. fuck.

529
00:30:56.272 --> 00:30:58.983
Bradley has 12 hours before
she gets charged with some bullshit.

530
00:30:59.067 --> 00:31:02.028
And shipped… I don't know fucking where.

531
00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:05.656
[inhales sharply] There's gotta be
something that we can do. you know.

532
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.784
[sighs]

533
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:11.329
What if I give him the software?
It's a little crazy but--

534
00:31:11.413 --> 00:31:13.498
You can't give away
something that you don't have.

535
00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:15.834
Wait. Hold on though.

536
00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:20.380
UBN's AI initiative completely stalled.

537
00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:24.675
I could license your software
through the network.

538
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.971
And then I could… I could get it to Ivanov
and your hands are completely clean.

539
00:31:29.056 --> 00:31:30.516
I am not gonna let you do that.

540
00:31:30.598 --> 00:31:32.893
There's a million different ways
that could blow up in your face.

541
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:37.064
Oh. but with our European platforms.
and the Olympics. there's gotta be a way

542
00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:39.525
I can get it to him
without there being a digital footprint.

543
00:31:39.607 --> 00:31:42.861
If the Feds found out about this.
we would both be supremely fucked.

544
00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:44.947
I know. I know.

545
00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:48.450
I know. But we just… Can we please try?

546
00:31:49.242 --> 00:31:50.618
We're so close.

547
00:32:00.253 --> 00:32:01.337
I'll talk to him.

548
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.092
[sighs]

549
00:32:05.592 --> 00:32:06.634
Thank you.

550
00:32:14.852 --> 00:32:17.855
We are licensing our AI software to UBN.

551
00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.942
Once Bradley's released.
Alex will get it to Ivanov.

552
00:32:22.025 --> 00:32:25.903
So you wanna launder a tech deal
through your ex-girlfriend?

553
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:30.116
Wow. I did not have that on my bingo card.

554
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.410
It won't touch us.

555
00:32:31.492 --> 00:32:32.786
What's the endgame here?

556
00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:34.288
Run off with Alex?

557
00:32:34.371 --> 00:32:36.498
Boar hunting with Vladimir Putin?

558
00:32:36.582 --> 00:32:39.750
Look. I am trying
to put my life back together here. okay?

559
00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:44.798
There's a karmic debt that needs to be
repaid and it is collecting interest.

560
00:32:44.882 --> 00:32:48.134
You know you're the only man
I've ever met who impressed me.

561
00:32:48.676 --> 00:32:51.512
But when you're around her. you lose it.

562
00:32:51.596 --> 00:32:54.849
You have all the power in the world
and you still can't let her go.

563
00:32:55.601 --> 00:32:57.644
Maybe that's true. but we're doing this.

564
00:32:58.729 --> 00:32:59.730
[sighs]

565
00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:01.565
I'll make some calls.

566
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.616
[Cory chuckles] This was my dad's.

567
00:33:12.867 --> 00:33:15.369
I thought my mom got rid of all his stuff.

568
00:33:15.453 --> 00:33:18.373
Maybe it's some kind of peace offering.

569
00:33:21.335 --> 00:33:23.921
I always thought she was hard on me
because of him.

570
00:33:24.003 --> 00:33:28.509
'Cause we look the same and she was
afraid that I was gonna leave her too.

571
00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:36.349
But she was just giving me the tools.
teaching me to survive.

572
00:33:36.933 --> 00:33:38.143
[chuckles]

573
00:33:43.648 --> 00:33:45.067
[Cory] I'm the last one left.

574
00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:47.486
End of the line.

575
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:49.904
Well. I'll join them soon enough.

576
00:33:49.988 --> 00:33:51.198
Just a matter of time.

577
00:33:51.698 --> 00:33:54.159
Then let's… let's not waste it.

578
00:34:03.626 --> 00:34:05.045
I'm gonna be right back.

579
00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:13.637
[door closes]

580
00:34:26.858 --> 00:34:28.193
[phone buzzing]

581
00:34:30.945 --> 00:34:32.155
Hey. Where are we?

582
00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.074
It's happening. It's happening.

583
00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:39.746
Tell André to go to the drop-off point
and to call you the minute he has Bradley.

584
00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:42.583
Uh… [chuckles] I'm in awe.

585
00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:44.876
Okay. I gotta go.

586
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.588
Okay. Hopefully the next time
I call you it'll be with Bradley.

587
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.755
I know. I'll be waiting. I'm waiting.

588
00:34:50.423 --> 00:34:51.675
[sighs]

589
00:35:04.271 --> 00:35:05.271
[sighs]

590
00:35:05.898 --> 00:35:06.981
[phone buzzes]

591
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:22.164
I'm sorry. Cory. I'll have to leave you.

592
00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:24.373
- Oh.
- Family matter.

593
00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:27.085
Okay. All right. Well…

594
00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:31.130
Uh. to be continued?

595
00:35:32.257 --> 00:35:33.759
I'd like that.

596
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.429
[chuckles]

597
00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:54.278
[opera singer continues singing]

598
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.295
Okay.

599
00:37:37.548 --> 00:37:38.634
[phone buzzes]

600
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.012
Bradley?

601
00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:46.557
Bradley?

602
00:37:47.809 --> 00:37:49.978
Honey. are you there?

603
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:53.481
Honey. just say something.

604
00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:55.400
Just say anything so I know you're okay.

605
00:37:57.945 --> 00:37:59.695
I'm sorry. uh…

606
00:38:01.197 --> 00:38:02.615
I-It didn't work.

607
00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:04.201
[breathes heavily]

608
00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:06.911
What do you…
What do you mean it didn't work?

609
00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:08.539
Chip?

610
00:38:12.708 --> 00:38:16.797
The trade fell through
and they won't release her.

611
00:38:17.965 --> 00:38:19.132
She's gone.

612
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.469
[gasps]

613
00:38:37.775 --> 00:38:40.278
[sighs] Paul. thank you for this.
We have to go.

614
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.655
[stammers] Are we good?

615
00:38:44.907 --> 00:38:46.076
Dmitri.

616
00:38:47.494 --> 00:38:49.996
[crowd cheering]

617
00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:55.626
[cheering continues]

618
00:39:01.717 --> 00:39:02.967
Excuse me. Excuse me.

619
00:39:05.304 --> 00:39:07.181
What just happened? They just left.

620
00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:08.389
Something went wrong.

621
00:39:09.182 --> 00:39:10.934
They moved her from the airport.

622
00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:12.853
[stammers] I don't understand. What…

623
00:39:12.936 --> 00:39:15.355
I don't know. I don't know.

624
00:39:16.898 --> 00:39:18.567
I. um… I have to go.

625
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.068
If-If you hear anything. just please--

626
00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:21.903
- [stammers] I'll let you know.
- Okay.

627
00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:46.969
[sighs]

628
00:39:49.972 --> 00:39:51.391
What do we do now?

629
00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:54.936
I don't know.

630
00:39:57.523 --> 00:39:59.065
[Ben] The truth is dangerous.

631
00:39:59.733 --> 00:40:02.568
And what we do here matters.

632
00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:09.534
And no amount of artificial intelligence
or social media can replace that.

633
00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:15.331
When a journalist is imprisoned.
it's because someone wants them silenced.

634
00:40:15.414 --> 00:40:17.083
We will not let that happen to Bradley.

635
00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:20.086
We will keep this story on the air
for as long as it takes.

636
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.047
This is day one.

637
00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:26.717
We don't stop reporting
until she comes home.

638
00:40:28.177 --> 00:40:29.471
Let's go make a show.

639
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:37.563
So folks. before we start the show.
uh. there's something

640
00:40:37.646 --> 00:40:39.481
that-that Chris and I have to talk about.

641
00:40:39.565 --> 00:40:42.025
[stammers]
It's a news story that affects all of us.

642
00:40:42.108 --> 00:40:44.610
but particularly those of us here
in the UBN family.

643
00:40:45.403 --> 00:40:49.032
Earlier this week our cohost.
Bradley Jackson. traveled to Belarus

644
00:40:49.115 --> 00:40:51.201
to do research for a story.

645
00:40:51.284 --> 00:40:54.288
And while she was at the Minsk airport.
she was detained by the authorities.

646
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:58.250
Now. despite attempts by the US
State Department to secure her release.

647
00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:01.753
Bradley is being charged with
conspiracy against the state of Belarus.

648
00:41:01.836 --> 00:41:06.132
UBN rejects all claims that
Bradley was working as a foreign agent.

649
00:41:06.215 --> 00:41:10.554
These charges are false and we have
full faith that she will be exonerated.

650
00:41:11.179 --> 00:41:12.264
[phone buzzes]

651
00:41:13.139 --> 00:41:14.557
[Amanda] Are we good?

652
00:41:15.266 --> 00:41:17.936
The State Department
has no idea what they tried to do.

653
00:41:18.019 --> 00:41:20.313
He put me in an impossible position.

654
00:41:20.898 --> 00:41:24.067
You had to protect Paul.
I had to protect Alex.

655
00:41:24.735 --> 00:41:26.652
What's my level of exposure?

656
00:41:26.737 --> 00:41:30.282
My family made the call to stop the trade.

657
00:41:30.364 --> 00:41:33.659
All through intermediaries.
It won't blow back on you.

658
00:41:34.577 --> 00:41:36.496
And what happens with Bradley Jackson?

659
00:41:37.121 --> 00:41:39.958
This is a government negotiation.

660
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:42.878
I'm… I have faith she will be returned.

661
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.172
Yeah. I guess we'll see.

662
00:41:45.838 --> 00:41:48.217
Yes. We will see.

663
00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:57.976
[in French] An exciting news day.

664
00:41:58.059 --> 00:41:59.143
Leave it.

665
00:41:59.894 --> 00:42:01.063
[sibling] Of course.

666
00:42:01.896 --> 00:42:03.690
You want me to clean up your mess

667
00:42:03.773 --> 00:42:05.275
and be on my way.

668
00:42:05.358 --> 00:42:08.653
You could show more gratitude
for my help with Minsk.

669
00:42:08.737 --> 00:42:09.947
Thanks for your help.

670
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.322
You're welcome.

671
00:42:11.405 --> 00:42:13.282
I know you think it should be you.

672
00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:17.329
That you should be the one to run things.

673
00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:19.164
But there's a reason it's me.

674
00:42:19.248 --> 00:42:20.916
I will do anything to protect our family.

675
00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:24.378
You think I won't?

676
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.463
They'll keep trying to get her back.

677
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.257
They can try.
