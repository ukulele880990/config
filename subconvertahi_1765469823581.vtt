2
00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:46.708
I sense you. brother.

3
00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:53.250
Hiding...

4
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.750
...behind your cloak.

5
00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:02.750
It is time to earn yours.

6
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:16.041
Still too small to take me head on.

7
00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.041
Use the cave!

8
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.125
You fight with rage.

9
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.875
I fight like father.

10
00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.875
You are not father. you are Dek!

11
00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:34.807
Do you yield?

12
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.087
Never!

13
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.129
Good.

14
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.625
I'm still alive. brother.

15
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:14.166
Still much to prove...

16
00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:16.666
...to show who you are.

17
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.546
I am Yautja.

18
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.500
Not yet.

19
00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.875
Are you holding your sword. Kwei?

20
00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.916
No.

21
00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:31.916
Pick it up!

22
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.250
You kept this toy?

23
00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:07.366
You remember what happened...

24
00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:10.458
I lost my fang!

25
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.958
And you saved my life.

26
00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.041
You protected me.

27
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.083
Come here.

28
00:06:29.046 --> 00:06:31.212
Fixed it for you.

29
00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:36.587
Don't blow yourself up.

30
00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:48.173
Today you make a vow...

31
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.140
...as our ancestors did before you.

32
00:06:58.754 --> 00:07:01.504
To earn your place in the clan...

33
00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:05.087
...you must choose your prey.

34
00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.129
Bring it home...

35
00:07:09.337 --> 00:07:12.004
...or never return.

36
00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:21.421
Wait - Go back!

37
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.171
Genna.

38
00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:30.215
The death planet.

39
00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:34.547
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

40
00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:40.504
Even father fears it.

41
00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:44.880
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

42
00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.462
Father calls me the weakest...

43
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:52.629
...so I must kill the strongest.

44
00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:56.254
Failure means death.

45
00:07:57.965 --> 00:08:01.005
Then I will not fail.

46
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:04.130
I cannot allow it.

47
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:09.259
I make my vow.

48
00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:14.924
I make my vow!

49
00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:11.462
Father.

50
00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:15.372
I welcome you with honor.

51
00:09:27.754 --> 00:09:30.879
Why is it not done?

52
00:09:31.712 --> 00:09:34.296
He deserves a hunt.

53
00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:37.874
He is our clan's weakness...

54
00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:42.790
...weakness must be culled.

55
00:09:43.838 --> 00:09:46.798
He will bring home the Kalisk.

56
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.432
Foolishness.

57
00:09:50.462 --> 00:09:52.423
He is a runt.

58
00:09:53.004 --> 00:09:56.883
You should have done it as he slept.

59
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.671
Kill him!

60
00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:00.671
Now!

61
00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:13.265
He will only honor us in death.

62
00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:30.765
Father.

63
00:10:43.172 --> 00:10:44.671
Kwei?

64
00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:47.962
Be brave. brother.

65
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.046
Father!

66
00:11:49.504 --> 00:11:50.587
Kwei!!!

67
00:12:03.963 --> 00:12:07.047
To forgive weakness...

68
00:12:08.547 --> 00:12:11.630
...is to show weakness...

69
00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:14.714
No! Father. no!

70
00:12:22.754 --> 00:12:24.504
Get your sword!

71
00:12:27.588 --> 00:12:29.296
Kwei!!!

72
00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:45.297
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

73
00:12:55.047 --> 00:12:57.713
Bring it home.

74
00:15:59.797 --> 00:16:02.212
Bring it home.

75
00:16:04.337 --> 00:16:06.798
For Kwei.

76
00:21:43.797 --> 00:21:45.299
Yautja!

77
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.010
Universal translation.

78
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.810
You hear Yautja. others hear their
language.

79
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:15.450
Oh boy.

80
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.890
This isn't great for you.

81
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.050
Wait for the needles to paralyze you.

82
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.490
Then eat you while you can't move.

83
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.160
I could help you but... 
I need a hand.

84
00:23:04.463 --> 00:23:07.268
Yautja hunt alone.

85
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.040
Yautja might hunt alone.

86
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.720
but...

87
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.700
...they die alone. too.

88
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.580
Kalisk.

89
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.140
You're hunting the Kalisk.

90
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.320
The venom makes them bloom.

91
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.860
Also makes them a handy antidote.

92
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.900
How about a lift?

93
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.220
Let's go.

94
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.420
Excuse you. sir.

95
00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:35.381
What happened to your legs?

96
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.140
I'm synthetic.

97
00:25:35.655 --> 00:25:38.800
I was built and deployed by the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation for research.

98
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.720
Because their humans wouldn't 
last a day on this planet.

99
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240
We found that-

100
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.240
Look.

101
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.360
Many Yautja have come 
for the Great Kalisk.

102
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.440
And none have survived it.

103
00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.480
Or Genna.

104
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.580
I've seen the Kalisk.

105
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.760
I survived it.

106
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.200
Here's my proposal.

107
00:26:08.925 --> 00:26:12.280
You take me along with you. 
and I'll guide you to its den.

108
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:18.820
Once there. I get my legs. you get your
trophy. and everyone's a winner.

109
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:19.940
Deal?

110
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.560
Yeah.

111
00:26:22.671 --> 00:26:25.005
You have seen the Kalisk?

112
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.480
Oh yeah.

113
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.800
I've seen the Kalisk.

114
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.310
Okay.

115
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.830
Good luck with your journey.

116
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.550
I'm just gonna...

117
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.010
go on my journey.

118
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.430
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

119
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:04.960
Hey.

120
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.040
I've already shown you 
that I can be useful to you.

121
00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:15.337
Useful...

122
00:27:15.338 --> 00:27:16.963
like tool?

123
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.080
Yes.

124
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.440
Yes.

125
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.460
Exactly.

126
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.180
Like a tool.

127
00:27:22.165 --> 00:27:24.360
The only way to survive 
Genna is to work with it.

128
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.340
And I know how.

129
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.660
And...

130
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.960
with the right...
tool...

131
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.400
you could get the Kalisk.

132
00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.440
You could be the first.

133
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.546
I will use you. tool.

134
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.460
You may call me thieves!

135
00:27:49.265 --> 00:27:50.480
And what does the chewing?

136
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.860
Your outside fangs or your inside teeth?

137
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.040
Oh.

138
00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.320
What should I call you?

139
00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.240
Huh?

140
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.460
Oh...

141
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.420
Oh...

142
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:04.780
I'm...

143
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.340
How fast were you going 
when your ship crashed?

144
00:28:10.965 --> 00:28:12.100
Faster than sublight speed?

145
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.120
We have incredible technology.

146
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.760
I haven't cracked that yet.

147
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.980
Also. that plasma sword is interesting.

148
00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:17.440
Is it unique to your clan?

149
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.300
And what may I call you?

150
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.420
I call these Imbre Anguis.

151
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.200
You just got a snack.

152
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.770
You catch more flies with honey 
than you do with vinegar.

153
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.030
Drink my life.

154
00:28:49.254 --> 00:28:50.587
Don't want flies.

155
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.130
Predatory organisms are my 
specific area of expertise.

156
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.230
I've studied Yautja extensively.

157
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.470
It's an impressive culture.

158
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.590
Here. ask me anything.

159
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.730
I bet I have the answer.

160
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.710
Very funny.

161
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.990
And you still haven't told me your name.

162
00:29:29.631 --> 00:29:32.171
Name is Dek.

163
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.422
Now talk that way.

164
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.080
Okay. sure.

165
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.380
Well...

166
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.520
Let's back up and...

167
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.520
start at the beginning.

168
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.280
It's so beautiful.

169
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:06.940
After all the time I've been stuck here.
I never get tired of the view.

170
00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:11.212
How long have you been here?

171
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.520
Well. we arrived on Genna two years ago
and we built a base.

172
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:21.120
Then I was in the vulture's nest for the
most exciting 13 days. 7 hours.

173
00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.320
43 minutes. and 2 seconds of my life.

174
00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:27.500
But I always knew someone would come.

175
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.860
I was just...

176
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.180
wrong about who.

177
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:35.549
Who would come?

178
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.450
Tessa.

179
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.650
Our crew is made up entirely of synths.

180
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.010
But Tessa and I are special.

181
00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:49.010
We have a higher 
sensitivity than the others.

182
00:30:49.712 --> 00:30:52.337
Sensitivity is weakness.

183
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.770
Your day is her room. your square.

184
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.830
The sensitivity is what allows us to
understand the creatures on this planet.

185
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.990
We were created to work in tandem.

186
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.210
Me cooped up in the lab. Tessa out in the
field. until the wonderful day Tessa let

187
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:12.970
me come with her.

188
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:19.650
We were exploring Genna. and then the
Kallisk attacked us.

189
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.370
Separated me. and us.

190
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:35.490
The last sound I remember hearing was
Tessa calling out my name. reaching for

191
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:35.730
me.

192
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.250
Then the Kallisk.

193
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.410
I didn't know what to do.

194
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.290
But I refuse to believe she's dead.

195
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.500
Tessa!

196
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.630
Hello. Tessa.

197
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.690
The company is not pleased.

198
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.230
Continued failure will 
result in your decommission.

199
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.250
Where's Thea?

200
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.760
The Yautja has Thea.

201
00:33:57.671 --> 00:33:59.587
I must eat.

202
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.780
Two warriors. Dek and Thea. on the hunt.

203
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.940
Quick question. what should I be doing?

204
00:34:12.463 --> 00:34:14.335
What is this creature?

205
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.690
Bone bison.

206
00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.310
Their Kalisk food.

207
00:34:20.337 --> 00:34:23.755
Then it will be my food. too.

208
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.550
So exciting.

209
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.190
Hunting with the Yautja?

210
00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:28.810
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

211
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:31.810
Just a warning.

212
00:34:32.432 --> 00:34:34.463
Quiet. tool!

213
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.230
Razor grass.

214
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.270
It'll cut you to ribbons.

215
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.390
We'll just go around.

216
00:34:47.887 --> 00:34:50.049
You give up too easily.

217
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.840
We might not be alone in this hunt.

218
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:07.880
I'm Critter.

219
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.720
I've never seen you before.

220
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.120
Thea.

221
00:35:16.845 --> 00:35:17.460
Nice to meet you.

222
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.120
Looks like your competition is better.

223
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.720
Careful within these trees. they're luna bugs!

224
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.260
We're close.

225
00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.000
And I thought this night 
would have been a big one.

226
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.240
As if.

227
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.500
The

228
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.280
Coming up behind you!

229
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200
Stronger than it looks!

230
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.840
Dek?

231
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.040
Dek!

232
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.420
Look!

233
00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.670
Not a Kalisk!

234
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.160
Have any other weapons?

235
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.140
Why'd you stop?

236
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.300
Let's get out of here!

237
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.340
I'll show you!

238
00:38:48.045 --> 00:38:49.922
You give up too easily.

239
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.390
That was the best hunt I've ever been on.

240
00:40:42.695 --> 00:40:44.150
This is the dream team right here.

241
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.630
The dynamic three. the dynamic trio.
the dynamic trio!

242
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.170
Trio!

243
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:50.530
Remember when we went down the tree?

244
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.690
That monster's mouth. I mean...

245
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.790
Didn't smell great. 
didn't smell great. but...

246
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.530
We got him.

247
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:58.970
We got him.

248
00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.790
And then we met you. our little 
sweet little. little thing.

249
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.610
Thank you. seriously. for that experience.

250
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.190
Truly amazing.

251
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.050
Thrilling.

252
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.690
Truly thrilling.

253
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.630
What was your favorite part?

254
00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:16.921
When I pierced its head with my sword.

255
00:41:17.507 --> 00:41:21.046
and its blood rushed down my face.

256
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.290
Aw. no thanks.

257
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.630
I don't eat. but that's very sweet.

258
00:41:39.004 --> 00:41:41.337
This flesh is not sweet.

259
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.230
Good to know.

260
00:41:48.995 --> 00:41:50.520
Our little bud here looks hungry.

261
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.740
I think she's marking you.

262
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.340
She wants you to be a part of her clan.

263
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.940
Maybe she's lost.

264
00:42:10.987 --> 00:42:13.462
I have no clan!

265
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.280
What do you mean?

266
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.960
Don't all Yautja have family?

267
00:42:17.672 --> 00:42:20.049
No clan.

268
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.160
So you never had anyone 
looking out for you?

269
00:42:25.712 --> 00:42:28.712
I had a brother.

270
00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.640
Ha?

271
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.280
What happened to him?

272
00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:40.254
Father killed him.

273
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.980
You're grieving.

274
00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:48.420
Grief is weakness.

275
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.050
You're here because you lost your brother.

276
00:42:55.295 --> 00:42:58.129
I am here for Kalisk.

277
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:03.546
Why are you here?

278
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.920
I'm here because traveling with you 
is the best way to get back to Tessa.

279
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.120
When I was in that vulture's nest. I
was so afraid I would never see her again.

280
00:43:18.343 --> 00:43:21.670
You should be able 
to survive on your own.

281
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.320
I can survive on my own.

282
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.240
But who would want to 
survive on their own?

283
00:43:33.838 --> 00:43:36.835
Tessa is your sister.

284
00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:47.970
Yeah. I guess she is.

285
00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.010
I have a sister.

286
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.720
What a lovely thought.

287
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.700
I need to find her.

288
00:44:07.343 --> 00:44:08.833
And legs.

289
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.360
Excuse me?

290
00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:13.963
Find your sister.

291
00:44:14.842 --> 00:44:16.385
And legs.

292
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:19.980
Was that a joke?

293
00:47:39.675 --> 00:47:40.717
The sun rises.

294
00:47:41.629 --> 00:47:43.045
Let's go.

295
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.920
We can't leave Bud.

296
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.560
Bud?

297
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:46.500
Yeah.

298
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.360
Bud.

299
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960
I named her.

300
00:47:49.836 --> 00:47:52.254
Yautja hunt alone.

301
00:47:53.535 --> 00:47:54.740
You're not alone.

302
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.020
I'm with you.

303
00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.336
You're a tool.

304
00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:07.410
The tree would have eaten us without her.

305
00:48:09.797 --> 00:48:13.209
We're not in the tree now.

306
00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:10.592
Kalisk?

307
00:49:16.423 --> 00:49:18.460
It drinks here.

308
00:49:20.585 --> 00:49:22.627
It drinks here?

309
00:49:25.876 --> 00:49:28.209
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

310
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.280
But saved us.

311
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.680
She spit on you to claim 
you as part of her family.

312
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.810
Why'd your father kill your brother?

313
00:49:56.585 --> 00:49:59.421
My brother was protecting me.

314
00:50:04.667 --> 00:50:06.712
The clan can have no weakness.

315
00:50:09.212 --> 00:50:11.546
I will show them strength.

316
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.470
On Earth?

317
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.230
There's a predator known as the wolf.

318
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.970
It's a powerful creature.

319
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:28.530
They hunt in packs.

320
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:30.410
They're very loyal.

321
00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:36.190
The leader of the pack is the alpha.
known as the most dominant.

322
00:50:37.086 --> 00:50:38.920
Wolf.

323
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.961
This alpha must be a great killer.

324
00:50:42.374 --> 00:50:44.421
I will hunt it too.

325
00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:49.350
The alpha isn't the wolf 
who kills the most.

326
00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:55.510
The alpha is actually the one 
who best protects the pack.

327
00:50:57.922 --> 00:50:59.462
I see...

328
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.140
But I will be the 
alpha that kills the most.

329
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.230
The alpha is actually the one 
who best protects the pack.

330
00:51:40.629 --> 00:51:42.671
The Kalisk's den?

331
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:12.920
Who are they?

332
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:15.910
Weyland-Utani synths.

333
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.770
The Kalisk destroyed 
most of our mission team.

334
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.400
Oh. there I am!

335
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:13.254
Easier to walk now.

336
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.420
It's about to be.

337
00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:16.712
No.

338
00:53:17.297 --> 00:53:19.463
Easier for me to walk now.

339
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.280
Oh. of course.

340
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.340
Right.

341
00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.360
Thank you. Deck.

342
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.900
I'm never gonna forget this.

343
00:53:35.757 --> 00:53:37.817
I too will remember this...

344
00:53:38.714 --> 00:53:39.841
...today I become Dek of the Yautja.

345
00:53:43.378 --> 00:53:45.964
I will honor Kwei...

346
00:53:47.754 --> 00:53:50.880
when I bring the Kalisk home.

347
00:53:53.087 --> 00:53:56.128
Then I taste revenge.

348
00:53:57.877 --> 00:54:01.296
You will be the first to see my trophy.

349
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.212
It is a great honor.

350
00:54:06.213 --> 00:54:07.671
For you.

351
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.980
Dek. there's something 
I have to tell you.

352
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.900
You need to leave now.

353
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.420
<i>Location beacon activated.</i>

354
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:18.880
What?

355
00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:20.580
I called Tessa.

356
00:54:20.915 --> 00:54:21.960
The company is on its way.

357
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:23.560
You can't be here when they arrive.

358
00:54:24.088 --> 00:54:26.629
I came here for the Kalisk.

359
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.360
So did I. Dek.

360
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:34.500
The company sent us 
here to capture the Kalisk.

361
00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:37.338
You want my trophy.

362
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.640
I'm sorry.

363
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.100
It's my fault.

364
00:54:40.797 --> 00:54:42.879
Where is the Kalisk?

365
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.020
The Kalisk...

366
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:47.220
Dek. you can't kill it.

367
00:54:47.546 --> 00:54:51.588
I use you. tool. You do not use me!

368
00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.680
I'm sorry.

369
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.700
You have to leave.

370
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.380
I needed you to help bring me here.

371
00:54:57.129 --> 00:54:59.176
I use you!

372
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:57.540
I'm sorry.

373
00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.740
What's this about?

374
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:04.129
Where is the Kalisk?

375
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.800
The Kalisk...

376
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.540
I'm trying to help you. Dek.

377
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.340
You think your brother saved your 
life just so you could die here?

378
00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:17.625
Then my death will be honorable.

379
00:55:23.337 --> 00:55:25.380
Call your sister.

380
00:55:26.296 --> 00:55:28.464
None can stop me.

381
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.100
Come on!

382
00:58:54.004 --> 00:58:56.046
Save yourself. tool!

383
01:00:51.922 --> 01:00:54.379
Tool. get these off!

384
01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:04.173
You are not Thia.

385
01:01:16.587 --> 01:01:18.629
Release me!

386
01:01:21.382 --> 01:01:24.462
You are another broken tool!

387
01:01:39.546 --> 01:01:41.588
Remove these!

388
01:01:42.505 --> 01:01:47.297
Or I'll rip out your 
spine and crush your skull!

389
01:01:57.379 --> 01:02:01.671
You are nothing. A device.

390
01:02:02.962 --> 01:02:06.587
Made by others to do their work for them.

391
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.200
I've seen so much.

392
01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:08.220
I have so much to tell you.

393
01:03:09.345 --> 01:03:11.060
I saw such incredible creatures.

394
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.480
The Yautja is a great traveling companion.

395
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.140
Thea. you were right about the Kalisk.

396
01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:22.957
You betrayed me!

397
01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:26.380
The creature is a regenerative miracle.

398
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:29.220
Humanity will thank us.

399
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.940
We have the Kalisk?

400
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.940
Yes.

401
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:38.200
And Mother will be pleased with your
additional catch.

402
01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.480
Additional catch?

403
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.380
The Yautja is not an ideal specimen.

404
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.760
No. not ideal.

405
01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.140
No.

406
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.850
But its technology is valuable.

407
01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:38.310
We can salvage its 
weapons and leave the Yautja.

408
01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:42.610
Good idea.

409
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:47.890
But it's so malformed.

410
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.170
We're going to need a sample.

411
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:52.490
For research.

412
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:05.330
He was not the goal of our mission.

413
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.350
Tessa. he is deficient!

414
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:14.110
For research.

415
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:14.270
Tessa!

416
01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.260
Thea. this is what is asked of us.

417
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.640
We can be more than what they ask of us.

418
01:05:46.185 --> 01:05:46.940
What can we be?

419
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:50.580
Sisters.

420
01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.560
Thea.

421
01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:24.270
Do you know why Mother gave us feelings?

422
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:29.810
So we could understand the creatures on
this planet.

423
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:36.790
And exploit them.

424
01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.490
The Yautja is different.

425
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.190
He rescued me.

426
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:47.750
Like you rescued me.

427
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:52.290
I did not come here to rescue you.

428
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.270
I am completing our mission.

429
01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:02.330
When we first faced the Kalisk.
I tried to protect you.

430
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:06.790
And that almost cost me everything.

431
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.250
What do you mean. Tessa?

432
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:16.190
I almost made the same mistake the
Yautja's brother made.

433
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.890
The weak must be cold.

434
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.990
And Thea. you're broken.

435
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.560
Tessa. incoming message from Mother.

436
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.040
Motivate the Yautja to explain its
weapons.

437
01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.060
And the unit?

438
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.520
Box her up.

439
01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:55.046
I trusted you.

440
01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:03.253
Don't like these tools.

441
01:08:03.588 --> 01:08:05.629
I'm sorry. My sister is -

442
01:08:06.089 --> 01:08:08.171
Don't like sister either.

443
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.180
Why are you speaking its language?

444
01:08:15.712 --> 01:08:18.379
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

445
01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.100
You heard the orders.

446
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.600
I am asking you to explain this device.

447
01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.520
What is the device?

448
01:08:28.882 --> 01:08:31.380
He's asking about the device.

449
01:08:31.755 --> 01:08:33.796
It's a children's toy.

450
01:08:36.177 --> 01:08:38.296
But say it's a map.

451
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.360
What did it say?

452
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.320
He says it's a map.

453
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:46.880
How does it work?

454
01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.711
Tell tool to look inside.

455
01:08:59.171 --> 01:09:01.087
That was a toy for children?

456
01:09:01.129 --> 01:09:02.254
Yautja children!

457
01:09:08.753 --> 01:09:09.801
Run. Dek!

458
01:09:12.087 --> 01:09:14.170
Go... Go!

459
01:11:15.546 --> 01:11:17.296
Kwei!

460
01:11:25.504 --> 01:11:28.048
<i>Enter destination coordinates. Kwei.</i>

461
01:12:03.004 --> 01:12:06.296
You saved me. brother.

462
01:12:09.587 --> 01:12:12.463
Wolf.

463
01:13:34.211 --> 01:13:35.964
Kalisk.

464
01:13:42.299 --> 01:13:44.282
Kalisk child.

465
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.380
Hello. Mother.

466
01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:29.600
Tessa.

467
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.880
We're about to load the Kalisk.

468
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.100
Priority one complete.

469
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.160
The specimen has been acquired.

470
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.780
Thank you. Tessa.

471
01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.140
We truly are building a better world.

472
01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.620
And what is the status of the Yautja?

473
01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.800
The Yautja is a defective specimen.

474
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.620
What is the status of the Yautja?

475
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:55.800
I'm sorry. Mother.

476
01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.120
The Yautja is dead.

477
01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:02.120
Then the Yautja is no longer a threat.

478
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.180
The company will be pleased.

479
01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:56.090
Nicely done!

480
01:17:59.190 --> 01:17:59.830
Oh. shit.

481
01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:46.930
Good job.

482
01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.080
Don't move.

483
01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.560
Dek. what are you doing here?

484
01:20:45.047 --> 01:20:46.712
I came to rescue you.

485
01:20:45.245 --> 01:20:53.010
You came back for me?

486
01:20:55.608 --> 01:20:57.123
Wolf.

487
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:02.630
What exactly are you wearing?

488
01:21:04.336 --> 01:21:06.004
Bone Bison.

489
01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.750
Dek of the Yautja.

490
01:21:16.483 --> 01:21:18.212
Not yet...

491
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:17.450
You and I...

492
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:23.890
We need to hurry.

493
01:21:24.395 --> 01:21:25.610
More of them will be here any minute.

494
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:33.820
What are you doing here?

495
01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:36.800
Thanks. bud.

496
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:37.340
I'm good.

497
01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.080
We need to go.

498
01:21:39.379 --> 01:21:40.712
Kalisk!

499
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360
Still. Dek?

500
01:21:46.733 --> 01:21:48.442
Kalisk child!

501
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:48.900
Bud?

502
01:21:52.712 --> 01:21:54.629
They have her mother!

503
01:21:59.985 --> 01:22:00.860
Bud's its child?

504
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:10.860
What's the plan?

505
01:22:11.553 --> 01:22:13.503
You free the Kalisk.

506
01:22:13.693 --> 01:22:15.337
I get my trophy.

507
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:25.730
You have 20 minutes to initiate launch.

508
01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:27.830
Let's go hunt.

509
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:35.760
Wait here.

510
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.520
You roll in there. you're not exactly
going to fit in.

511
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840
I have an idea.

512
01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:51.800
I see.

513
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.300
On me.

514
01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:27.190
What are you doing?

515
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:36.430
What are you doing here?

516
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:38.250
I told you to get to the Yautja.

517
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:41.910
You said to prepare the ship for takeoff
in 20 minutes.

518
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.370
Then what are you doing here?

519
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:45.830
I gave you an order!

520
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.140
What should we do about the creature?

521
01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.480
What creature?

522
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.660
You should listen to her.

523
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:07.840
I should listen to her?

524
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:09.600
I don't know.

525
01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.320
We need his eyes.

526
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:07.750
How does it feel to be hunting?

527
01:27:10.049 --> 01:27:11.796
You tell me.

528
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:56.090
there is no time to waste.

529
01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.200
You're not sisters.

530
01:33:01.296 --> 01:33:03.004
That's not yours.

531
01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:41.320
Dek of the Yautja.

532
01:33:36.962 --> 01:33:38.715
Not yet.

533
01:34:32.630 --> 01:34:34.588
You've come here for revenge?

534
01:34:35.381 --> 01:34:38.172
I've come for my cloak.

535
01:34:42.506 --> 01:34:44.088
What is this?

536
01:34:44.587 --> 01:34:47.299
I've completed my hunt.

537
01:34:47.839 --> 01:34:50.172
That is my trophy.

538
01:34:51.713 --> 01:34:53.462
You disgrace our clan...

539
01:34:53.511 --> 01:34:55.254
And so did Kwei.

540
01:34:57.933 --> 01:35:00.796
Get rid of him.

541
01:36:55.348 --> 01:36:59.921
Perhaps the right son did survive.

542
01:37:00.712 --> 01:37:02.462
Yield now...

543
01:37:03.046 --> 01:37:06.212
...and take your place in our clan.

544
01:37:08.048 --> 01:37:10.715
I have my own clan.

545
01:38:35.546 --> 01:38:37.297
It's my mother.
