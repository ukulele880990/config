being a novelist

-This is Will. I'm Cin.
-Hi.

182
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.512
-"Sin"?
-With a C.

183
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:38.612
Not short for "Cindy."

184
00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:40.581
Short for "Cinnamon."

185
00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:42.716
Um. I'm... I'm Sage.

186
00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:44.819
-and this is Diego.
-[Will] Hi.

187
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:48.557
Look. I'm pretty good
at reading people.

188
00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:52.326
and I get the gist that you guys
are not the most spontaneous.

189
00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:55.062
Um...

190
00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:58.332
[Cin] Guys. this is
so awkward. I get it.

191
00:09:58.432 --> 00:09:59.800
but the alternatives
are not great.

192
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.504
We have food.
We have a shit-ton of alcohol.

193
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.405
-You're an amazing chef.
-Yes. I am.

194
00:10:04.506 --> 00:10:07.775
He'll cook you a lunch you won't
forget. And we can just agree

195
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.277
that if. at any point. any of us
feel uncomfortable or weird.

196
00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:13.548
you guys can do your little
rock. paper. scissors game.

197
00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.282
Winner stays. loser goes.

198
00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:20.654
[upbeat music playing]

199
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:39.473
[Cin] <i>When Will</i>
<i>saw this house on the app.</i>

200
00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:41.041
<i>he thought "Bone Lake"</i>
<i>was a euphemism.</i>

201
00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:43.177
-[Sage] <i>Oh. great.</i>
-[Will] <i>I thought it was called</i>

202
00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:45.045
<i>Bone Lake because it's a</i>
<i>secluded place where people--</i>

203
00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:47.549
-[Cin] <i>Don't say it.</i>
-Yeah. I thought that.

204
00:10:47.648 --> 00:10:49.518
-Great minds.
-Male minds.

205
00:10:49.618 --> 00:10:52.286
[Will] But it turns out.
in the 1950s

206
00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:53.754
there was this wealthy family

207
00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:55.723
that bought up
all the land in the area.

208
00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.124
When they discovered the lake.

209
00:10:57.224 --> 00:11:00.828
<i>they found dozens</i>
<i>of human skeletons</i>

210
00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:02.631
<i>all over the beach.</i>

211
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.398
<i>One theory is</i>

212
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:06.066
<i>there was a serial killer</i>

213
00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:08.769
<i>who would dispose his bodies</i>
<i>in the lake.</i>

214
00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:13.440
<i>And after a storm.</i>
<i>they all washed ashore.</i>

215
00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:22.983
[Diego]
So. what brings you here?

216
00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:26.287
[Will] Oh. you know.
just looking to spice things up.

217
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.355
I'm not sure
how quick I can jump into

218
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:30.324
the straight-up guy talk.

219
00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:34.228
Sage is cute as fuck.

220
00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:38.032
She's girl-next-door hot.
which is the best kind.

221
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.335
Totally intended
as a compliment.

222
00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.870
I mean. I know how lucky I am.

223
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.841
but frankly. Cin is too pretty.

224
00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:52.846
Let's face it. Everyone
wants to fuck my girlfriend.

225
00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:54.748
I'm not saying
you wanna fuck her.

226
00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:58.185
[grunts] Sage and I
are very happy together.

227
00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:02.489
Dude. I can already tell
you're a good guy.

228
00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:06.026
I like you.

229
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:07.261
[chuckles]

230
00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:17.639
Aw. look at you both.
You're so cute.

231
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.406
So. I wanna get
to know you more.

232
00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:21.075
How'd you and Diego meet?

233
00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:23.645
Oh. we met in college.

234
00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:24.945
He's from Mexico City.

235
00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:26.880
but he came to the U.S.
for school.

236
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.684
-So. Diego is a writer?
-Yeah. he is.

237
00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:31.919
Yeah.
Well. for the last few years.

238
00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:36.390
he's been. um. teaching
at. uh. this community college.

239
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.594
But he's gonna be writing
a novel full-time now.

240
00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:41.862
-Stop. You're kidding.
-Yeah.

241
00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:43.565
So. I'm gonna
cover us financially.

242
00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:46.300
That is a really
bold move. Sage.

243
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.969
Yeah. it's exciting.

244
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:54.308
I think it's really sweet of you
to support his dreams like that.

245
00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:56.377
I mean. he must be
a really great writer.

246
00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:58.245
Yeah.

247
00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:17.699
[Will] Hey. buddy.

248
00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:20.234
Hey. Oof. Shit.

249
00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:22.403
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

250
00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:25.939
It's okay. You're lucky that
I have no survival instincts.

251
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.342
or. you know. I might
have punched you in the throat.

252
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:30.878
[chuckles]

253
00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:32.647
You're funny. man.

254
00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:35.550
Well. I'm gonna go for a run.
Wanna join me?

255
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.619
-Just gonna do 5-10 miles.
-Okay.

256
00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.920
Well. yeah. that sounds awful.

257
00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:42.423
-All right. man. Suit yourself.
-Yeah. enjoy.

258
00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.193
[groans]

259
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.897
-[Will] Hey.
-Oh. man.

260
00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.599
You gotta stop doing that.

261
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [chuckles]

262
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.468
-Okay.
-Look. I. uh...

263
00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:57.271
I know you probably didn't
want me to see the ring box.

264
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.574
but I did.

265
00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:01.275
Are you thinking of...?

266
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:05.079
Yeah. I was planning
to do it here by the lake.

267
00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:06.380
Oh. shit.

268
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.948
Until we showed up

269
00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:10.417
and ruined
your romantic weekend.

270
00:14:10.518 --> 00:14:13.220
-It's not your fault. It's okay.
-Dude. I'm so sorry.

271
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.357
Look. uh. you just
give me a heads-up.

272
00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:18.793
and I'll make sure
we get out of your way. okay?

273
00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:20.060
Cool. yeah. Thanks.

274
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.529
The day after tomorrow.

275
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.297
at. like. sunset?

276
00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:24.632
-Wow.
-Yeah.

277
00:14:24.733 --> 00:14:27.034
All right. great. Yeah.

278
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.571
C... Can I see it?

279
00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:31.872
Sure. Yeah.

280
00:14:34.642 --> 00:14:37.779
Oh. man. It's beautiful.

281
00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:39.514
It was my grandmother's.

282
00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:41.348
It's not exactly
what Sage would have chosen.

283
00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:43.518
but. you know.
it's a family heirloom.

284
00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:45.419
I'm sure she's gonna love it.

285
00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.190
I don't really know
what I'm doing. man.

286
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.630
Look. I barely know her. but I'm
sure she wants to marry you.

287
00:14:57.599 --> 00:14:58.867
Right?

288
00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:01.235
Well. I hope so. [chuckles]

289
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:03.170
Right. All right. I'm gonna run.

290
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.472
All right. cool. cool.
Yeah. yeah. enjoy.

291
00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:16.950
[Cin] <i>How long have you</i>
<i>and Diego been together?</i>

292
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.018
[Sage] <i>Like. three years.</i>

293
00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:20.120
How long have you guys
been together?

294
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.690
I feel like we've known
each other our whole lives.

295
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.159
We've officially been a couple
for eight years.

296
00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.994
but we've known each other
since we were kids.

297
00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:30.264
-Aw. that's so cute.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

298
00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:34.502
It's really romantic.
but it's not without its drama.

299
00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:36.871
-[Sage] Mm.
-Our parents were really close.

300
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.206
so it was a shock to everyone
we hooked up.

301
00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:42.309
Well. hopefully. they're happy
now that you guys are so happy.

302
00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:45.112
Yeah. My dad
never really took to Will.

303
00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:47.948
I wish I was attracted
to harmless.

304
00:15:49.517 --> 00:15:50.652
I'm not.

305
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:55.523
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

306
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:58.793
-Cin. what do you do?
-I'm in wealth management.

307
00:15:58.893 --> 00:16:00.360
So. I manage
rich people's money.

308
00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:04.933
Investments and that kind
of thing. It's lucrative.

309
00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:06.400
[Sage] Fun.

310
00:16:07.702 --> 00:16:12.105
Diego. I have a client
I think could help you.

311
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.876
Edmund Kerns.

312
00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:18.045
-It's my favorite author.
-Get out of here.

313
00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:20.080
I should get him
to read some of your work.

314
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.549
Oh. my God. No. I couldn't
ask you to do that.

315
00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:24.151
-No. no. no. he could. He can.
-Yes. definitely.

316
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:27.254
You are not asking.
I'm offering.

317
00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:28.989
But here's the thing.
I hate fiction.

318
00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.593
Will loves fiction.

319
00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:33.393
Yeah. I do.

320
00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:35.028
Give him something
of yours to read.

321
00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:37.030
and if he likes it.

322
00:16:37.364 --> 00:16:39.634
-I'll share it with Edmund.
-Thank you.

323
00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:40.902
-Wow.
-[Sage] Aw.

324
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.070
I'd like to make a toast.

325
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.038
-Ooh.
-Okay.

326
00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:49.042
To friendship. New friendship.

327
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.411
And to Diego and Sage.

328
00:16:51.513 --> 00:16:54.749
To Will and Cin
and new friendship. Yes.

329
00:16:54.849 --> 00:16:56.149
-Cheers.
-[Will] Cheers.

330
00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:59.687
-I love you.
-I love you.

331
00:17:02.957 --> 00:17:05.158
[water running]

332
00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:22.710
[breathing heavily]

333
00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:35.289
[groans softly]

334
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:39.393
Babe. forgot to plug in the car.

335
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:44.732
Sage?

336
00:17:48.903 --> 00:17:49.804
[grunts]

337
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.477
[clears throat]

338
00:17:57.579 --> 00:17:59.581
[water running]

339
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.090
Hey. Sage?

340
00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:11.960
Yeah?

341
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.761
Um...

342
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:15.663
We forgot to plug in the car.

343
00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:18.265
-Huh?
-The car.

344
00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:19.767
We forgot to plug it in.

345
00:18:19.867 --> 00:18:21.803
I'm gonna go do that.

346
00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:25.472
Unless you want me
to join you in there.

347
00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.775
[chuckles softly]

348
00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:28.843
Um...

349
00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:30.578
I could wash your back.

350
00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:32.880
Or your front.

351
00:18:34.181 --> 00:18:35.617
I'm okay.

352
00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:38.418
Yeah.

353
00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:40.320
Cool. Um. yeah. I'll just...

354
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.557
I'll just go plug in the car.

355
00:18:42.657 --> 00:18:44.324
Okay.

356
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:47.494
[door closes]

357
00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:56.938
[Cin] Diego?

358
00:18:57.038 --> 00:18:57.872
Hi.

359
00:18:57.972 --> 00:18:59.807
-Hi.
-Are you alone?

360
00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:02.376
Um. yeah. Sage is working

361
00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:05.278
-and Will is out jogging.
-Oh.

362
00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:08.382
Well. do you mind helping me
with something really quick?

363
00:19:08.883 --> 00:19:11.519
What... Um. what do you need?

364
00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:13.921
I really appreciate it.

365
00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:16.189
-Thank you.
-Yes. of course.

366
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:18.291
[Cin sighs]

367
00:19:20.795 --> 00:19:22.764
Um...

368
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.834
[stammers then chuckles]
Any idea where I should start?

369
00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:28.803
You know. I thought
they were in my makeup bag.

370
00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:31.639
Do you mind
just looking in the bathroom?

371
00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:33.373
Bathroom. Of course.

372
00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.682
Probably on the counter.
The makeup bag.

373
00:19:40.782 --> 00:19:43.483
-Okay. yes. makeup bag.
-[giggles]

374
00:19:43.584 --> 00:19:45.053
I shouldn't take off my contacts

375
00:19:45.153 --> 00:19:46.721
without knowing
where my glasses are.

376
00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:49.023
Don't worry.
You know. Sage does it all the--

377
00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:51.391
-Sorry. Sorry.
-[giggles] It's okay.

378
00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:53.895
Do you guys
both have bad eyesight?

379
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:55.963
-Yeah.
-You wear glasses.

380
00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:58.166
-Are they there?
-Um...

381
00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:00.300
No. they... They're not here.

382
00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:02.637
Okay. Um...

383
00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:05.238
Do you mind just
finding something for me to wear

384
00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:06.574
so I'm not standing here
in a towel?

385
00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.176
-Of course. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

386
00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:09.711
My suitcase is the pink one.

387
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:12.580
The pink one. Yeah. sure.

388
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.881
[Diego] Uh...

389
00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:18.119
Okay.

390
00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.687
What can I get you--

391
00:20:21.089 --> 00:20:23.691
Uh. what... What do you need?

392
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:26.259
Can you grab me
a pair of panties?

393
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:28.295
Panties. yes. Uh...

394
00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:29.931
Oh. Okay.

395
00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:32.700
-Um...
-And a pair of jeans.

396
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.136
Jeans. Okay. jeans.

397
00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.237
Oh. jeans. This.

398
00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:39.173
And then a cherry top.

399
00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:42.275
Cherry. Cherry. like...

400
00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:45.113
-Cherry.
-It... It has cherries on it.

401
00:20:45.213 --> 00:20:46.313
It has cherries on it.

402
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.616
Oh. it does have cherries on it.

403
00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:50.818
I... I see. Yes.

404
00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:52.452
-Okay?
-Thank you. Diego.

405
00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:54.254
Sure. Sure. Of co--
Oh. do you want a bra?

406
00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:55.656
-I...
-No.

407
00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:56.724
-No?
-I'm okay.

408
00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:59.660
You are a lifesaver.

409
00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:01.328
They have to be
in here somewhere.

410
00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:02.964
if you don't mind looking
a little bit more.

411
00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:05.432
Uh. no. I don't...

412
00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:07.367
I... I don't mind.

413
00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:11.404
You know what? They're
probably in my car. I'll just--

414
00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:14.642
I'll put in my contacts.
and I'll look for them later.

415
00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:16.043
Thank you. Diego.

416
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.345
Diego?

417
00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.782
Diego?

[Cin] Guess we're both blind.

429
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:50.178
-[giggles]
-Sorry?

430
00:21:50.278 --> 00:21:52.412
-Here you go.
-Oh. wow.

431
00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:55.415
I can't see anything
without my contacts.

432
00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:56.784
Luckily. I just found them.

433
00:21:56.884 --> 00:21:59.287
Yeah. my eyes are horrible.
Is this for me?

434
00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.956
-It is for you.
-Thank you.

435
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:05.092
Mm.

436
00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:06.359
Where's Diego?

437
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.830
Oh. The last time I saw him.

438
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.998
he was trying to find
a writing sample

439
00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:13.034
-to show Will.
-Oh. no.

440
00:22:13.134 --> 00:22:15.368
So. he'll probably be doing that

441
00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:17.271
-for the rest of the weekend.
-I'm so sorry.

442
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.006
I wanna make sure that you know

443
00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:21.509
I'm having so much fun
hanging out with you.

444
00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:23.476
-So have I.
-I just...

445
00:22:23.578 --> 00:22:26.013
I need to make sure
that we're cool.

446
00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:29.482
-Yeah.
-We're cool?

447
00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:33.554
-Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?
-I don't know.

448
00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:35.823
The whole Diego seeing me
in nothing but a towel.

449
00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:40.528
[sighs] I just didn't want you
to be mad at me.

450
00:22:40.628 --> 00:22:43.396
So. Diego saw you in a towel?

451
00:22:43.496 --> 00:22:45.833
Well. he might have seen
a little bit more than that.

452
00:22:45.933 --> 00:22:46.868
but it was my fault.

453
00:22:46.968 --> 00:22:50.671
-Did he not tell you this?
-Um... No.

454
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:52.540
I couldn't find my glasses.
I asked for his help.

455
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.177
I don't want you to think that
anything inappropriate happened.

456
00:22:56.277 --> 00:22:58.378
-Yeah.
-Nothing happened.

457
00:22:58.813 --> 00:23:02.350
-I know. It's okay. [laughs]
-[laughs]

458
00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:04.752
I just know
it can get really tricky

459
00:23:04.852 --> 00:23:07.688
this many years
into a relationship. so...

460
00:23:08.122 --> 00:23:10.725
I would wanna know. you know?

461
00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:13.895
-What do you mean?
-Hm.

462
00:23:13.995 --> 00:23:15.428
Men are stupid.

463
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.365
Men are really fucking stupid.

464
00:23:17.464 --> 00:23:18.566
-Yeah.
-And they do dumb shit.

465
00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:19.834
-Right.
-You know what I mean?

466
00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:21.936
And women
always blame each other.

467
00:23:22.036 --> 00:23:23.871
Like. a guy
can stand up for himself.

468
00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:25.873
I want you to know.
and I need you to know

469
00:23:25.973 --> 00:23:27.909
that I would never let anything
inappropriate happen.

470
00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:29.043
I promise you.

471
00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:31.345
-I trust Diego. It's really--
-Good.

472
00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:33.514
Good. You should trust Diego.

473
00:23:33.614 --> 00:23:36.083
I feel so dumb
that I even said anything.

474
00:23:36.183 --> 00:23:38.920
I'm gonna go before
I say anything else stupid.

475
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.255
but let me know
if you need a refill on that.

476
00:23:41.355 --> 00:23:42.957
-Okay. thank you.
-I'll see you later.

477
00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:43.991
Yeah.

478
00:23:49.297 --> 00:23:50.932
[grunts]

479
00:23:53.234 --> 00:23:54.702
Hey.

480
00:23:54.802 --> 00:23:56.070
Hey.

481
00:23:59.173 --> 00:24:00.675
She's pretty.

482
00:24:01.275 --> 00:24:02.643
So is he.

483
00:24:03.476 --> 00:24:04.312
Yeah.

484
00:24:04.412 --> 00:24:05.947
So are you.

485
00:24:06.047 --> 00:24:07.882
[chuckles]

486
00:24:07.982 --> 00:24:10.084
-That was really good. So good.
-That was good. right?

487
00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:13.154
Yeah. it was definitely
the right thing to say.

488
00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:18.793
They've got kind of. like.
a weird vibe.

489
00:24:20.995 --> 00:24:22.530
Sometimes.

490
00:24:23.731 --> 00:24:27.068
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

491
00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:31.471
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

492
00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:33.941
Wait.

493
00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:36.310
Do you think we should leave?

494
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.945
I don't know.

495
00:24:38.612 --> 00:24:40.681
I mean. this weekend
was supposed to be just us.

496
00:24:40.781 --> 00:24:44.218
and now
we're with two strangers.

497
00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:47.722
Well. we had some time
for us on this trip already.

498
00:24:48.322 --> 00:24:53.094
They ruined my clothing-optional
weekend. for sure. but...

499
00:24:54.929 --> 00:24:56.263
It's just...

500
00:24:56.697 --> 00:24:59.600
It's crazy that they offered
to get my writing read.

501
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.204
I know. It's a really
good opportunity.

502
00:25:03.304 --> 00:25:04.872
-Right?
-Yeah.

503
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.309
Look. if anything
too weird happens.

504
00:25:08.409 --> 00:25:10.578
we just pack our bags and go.
Okay?

505
00:25:10.678 --> 00:25:12.146
It's just tonight
and tomorrow night.

506
00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:14.048
And then we're back on the road.

507
00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:15.950
[grunts]

508
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.418
Please?

509
00:25:17.518 --> 00:25:20.187
Please? I... I really need this.

510
00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:24.058
-Okay.
-Okay.

511
00:25:28.162 --> 00:25:30.197
[tense music playing]

512
00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:35.536
-[Sage] Hey. guys.
-[Will and Cin] Hey!

513
00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:39.407
[Will] Do you guys
like to play games?

514
00:25:39.508 --> 00:25:41.208
I like games.

515
00:25:41.609 --> 00:25:44.779
-[Will] Diego?
-Oh. he doesn't play anything

516
00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:46.947
that has more rules
than rock. paper. scissors.

517
00:25:47.048 --> 00:25:48.849
Okay. rock. paper. scissors
is not a game.

518
00:25:48.949 --> 00:25:50.584
it's a conflict resolution tool.

519
00:25:50.684 --> 00:25:53.522
-Well. we love games.
-All kinds of games.

520
00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:56.190
Easy games. Hard games.
Low stakes. High stakes.

521
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.360
Well. I'm down. but you're gonna
have to convince Diego.

522
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.928
It's not--
I just don't like games.

523
00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:02.663
I think there's enough
competition in the world.

524
00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:04.031
-Here we go.
-I prefer activities

525
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:06.033
that promote harmony.
like drinks.

526
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:07.435
-Boo!
-Thank you.

527
00:26:07.536 --> 00:26:08.537
He also doesn't like them.

528
00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:09.970
but I'm very good at them.

529
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:11.472
-That is not true.
-That checks out.

530
00:26:11.572 --> 00:26:12.773
We will be so gentle with you.

531
00:26:12.873 --> 00:26:15.476
Baby. we won't be. We can't.

532
00:26:16.043 --> 00:26:18.212
We can't leave you out. Diego.

533
00:26:18.312 --> 00:26:20.581
You know what? I've got an idea.

534
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:22.383
Oh. God. What is it?

535
00:26:22.483 --> 00:26:25.119
Why don't we break into
the locked doors

536
00:26:25.219 --> 00:26:27.655
-at the end of the hallway?
-Baby. no. that's not a game.

537
00:26:27.755 --> 00:26:29.590
-That's literally a crime.
-It's a game.

538
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.793
All you need for a game
is rules and opponents.

539
00:26:32.893 --> 00:26:35.096
Our opponents
are the motherfuckers

540
00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:37.731
who booked us in this
sweet-ass lake house.

541
00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:39.733
And the rules are...

542
00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:42.537
Break into the rooms
without anyone ever knowing.

543
00:26:42.636 --> 00:26:43.971
-I don't hate it.
-You know what?

544
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:45.739
-What?
-It's easy enough to win

545
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.241
if we all play
by the same rules.

546
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:48.976
[Will] Okay. come on.

547
00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:50.978
[all chuckle]

548
00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:54.748
[Diego] And first of all. why do
you have a meat tenderizer?

549
00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:57.751
Because. Diego.
I couldn't find a hammer.

550
00:26:57.852 --> 00:27:00.354
I thought you couldn't enter
without anybody finding out.

551
00:27:00.454 --> 00:27:01.689
Uh. yeah. I can.

552
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:03.958
Which door should we do first?

553
00:27:04.058 --> 00:27:05.259
[Cin] Mmm...

554
00:27:06.393 --> 00:27:07.529
-This one?
-This one.

555
00:27:07.628 --> 00:27:09.163
All right.

556
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.298
[Diego]
What? That's never gonna work.

557
00:27:11.398 --> 00:27:15.504
Oh. it absolutely works. Diego.
Check YouTube.

558
00:27:15.604 --> 00:27:17.872
You really
can learn anything online.

559
00:27:17.972 --> 00:27:23.310
You just gently tap
on the side of the lock.

560
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:28.349
and the tumblers
fall into place.

561
00:27:29.884 --> 00:27:32.820
-Guys.
-Baby. wait until you see this.

562
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.989
-[Cin] What is it?
-Oh. my God.

563
00:27:35.089 --> 00:27:37.458
I don't know what I was
expecting. but it wasn't this.

564
00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:38.759
Guys. what is this?

565
00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:40.394
Yo. we call dibs
on the sex swing.

566
00:27:40.494 --> 00:27:41.862
[Cin] Let them use it.
We have one.

567
00:27:41.962 --> 00:27:43.964
No. we're good.
Don't sit on that.

568
00:27:44.064 --> 00:27:45.933
-Yeah. Thank you.
-That's not clean.

569
00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:49.538
I don't think it's a good idea
to touch anything in here.

570
00:27:49.638 --> 00:27:51.238
Do you guys want
a sex toy for later?

571
00:27:51.338 --> 00:27:53.908
No. we're good. Actually.
we're done. Let's go. Sage.

572
00:27:54.008 --> 00:27:55.476
-You wanna go?
-Yeah. let's go.

573
00:27:55.577 --> 00:27:56.844
-Fuck. yeah!
-[Diego] Thank you. guys.

574
00:27:56.944 --> 00:27:58.479
Babe. they're clean.

575
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.182
[Diego] Don't touch anything.
Jesus.

576
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:08.322
-[Diego] Wait till you see this.
-[Will] Oh. my...

577
00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:09.924
[Cin] What is it?

578
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.227
Guys.

579
00:28:13.994 --> 00:28:15.829
No.

580
00:28:18.766 --> 00:28:21.035
Do Ouija boards count
as games. Diego?

581
00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:22.970
-[Cin] Fuck this.
-[Sage] Guys. I don't...

582
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.773
I don't...
I don't wanna be in here.

583
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:26.974
[Cin] Don't go near that thing.

584
00:28:27.074 --> 00:28:29.343
[Sage] I'm regretting
coming in here.

585
00:28:29.443 --> 00:28:30.744
and I wanna leave.

586
00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:35.149
-[Will] What does it say?
-[Diego] "The search continues

587
00:28:35.249 --> 00:28:37.985
for prominent Manhattan
businessman Robert Price

588
00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:39.887
and his wife. Marilyn Price.

589
00:28:39.987 --> 00:28:42.823
who have been missing
for almost two weeks.

590
00:28:42.923 --> 00:28:44.725
The couple and their children

591
00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:47.027
who frequently vacation
on Bone Lake...

592
00:28:47.127 --> 00:28:49.897
-What?
-...were scheduled

593
00:28:49.997 --> 00:28:51.232
to spend the long weekend

594
00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:53.400
at their secluded
lakefront property."

595
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.501
Wait. like. this house?

596
00:28:54.603 --> 00:28:55.803
-They mean this house?
-What?

597
00:28:55.903 --> 00:28:58.305
-[Diego] Yeah. I think so.
-[Will laughing]

598
00:28:58.405 --> 00:29:00.709
-Stop laughing. It's--
-How old is the article?

599
00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:02.743
-Look how scared you are.
-It's from...

600
00:29:02.843 --> 00:29:05.145
-[mumbles] 15 years ago.
-[Sage] Guys.

601
00:29:05.246 --> 00:29:07.649
-Baby. please. I can't do this.
-Yeah.

602
00:29:07.748 --> 00:29:09.250
Yeah. I'm done. too.

603
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.451
[Will] Aw. guys!

604
00:29:10.552 --> 00:29:14.855
-Ooh. so scary. [laughs]
-Yeah. That was so scary.

605
00:29:15.222 --> 00:29:17.525
You guys don't want
door number three?

606
00:29:17.626 --> 00:29:19.728
I vote for locking these doors

607
00:29:19.827 --> 00:29:21.128
and pretending we never went in.

608
00:29:21.228 --> 00:29:25.165
I had a feeling.
All right. Fair enough.

609
00:29:31.606 --> 00:29:33.774
[tense music playing]

610
00:29:44.184 --> 00:29:45.853
-[Cin moaning]
-[thumping]

611
00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:48.455
[chuckles]

612
00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:50.692
[Cin continues moaning]

613
00:29:51.125 --> 00:29:53.427
-Are you hearing this?
-Oh. my God.

614
00:29:53.528 --> 00:29:54.962
They're pretty loud.

615
00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:56.665
Should we say something?

616
00:29:56.765 --> 00:30:00.000
Oh. God. I don't wanna
hurt their feelings.

617
00:30:02.069 --> 00:30:05.005
You know. we can. uh.
make some noise of our own.

618
00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:07.841
See... See if we can
drown them out.

619
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:10.277
Hey.

620
00:30:10.779 --> 00:30:13.981
Why are you so against
using sex toys?

621
00:30:15.583 --> 00:30:16.884
Are we gonna revisit this again?

622
00:30:16.984 --> 00:30:19.219
You wrote a whole article
about it.

623
00:30:19.587 --> 00:30:21.955
I won an award for that article.

624
00:30:22.356 --> 00:30:26.060
Not that I'll be doing that
again any time soon. but...

625
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.764
Sage. if you wanna be
a freelance journalist.

626
00:30:29.863 --> 00:30:31.065
then that's what you should do.

627
00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:33.300
I didn't ask you
to take the editor's job.

628
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.036
-I want us to be equals.
-I'm not saying that.

629
00:30:36.136 --> 00:30:40.107
I'm happy
to do the editing job for us.

630
00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:42.976
That has nothing to do
with your attitude on sex toys.

631
00:30:43.077 --> 00:30:45.112
I just think we should be
pleasuring each other.

632
00:30:45.212 --> 00:30:47.281
That's all.
It's our job in the bedroom.

633
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:51.218
I don't think we should be
using things to help with that.

634
00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:52.953
And I'm entitled
to have that opinion.

635
00:30:53.053 --> 00:30:55.956
You're entitled
to any opinion you want.

636
00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:57.958
but it's easy for you
to say that.

637
00:30:58.058 --> 00:31:01.128
You have a completely
different anatomy than I do.

638
00:31:06.367 --> 00:31:07.034
[grunts]

639
00:31:07.134 --> 00:31:09.036
I saw you earlier.

640
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.107
What?

641
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.612
Masturbating in the bath.

642
00:31:20.447 --> 00:31:21.649
Okay.

643
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:24.451
I offered to join.

644
00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:33.528
Are you mad at me because I
wanted to give myself an orgasm?

645
00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:36.029
No. I'm not mad. It's just...

646
00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:40.934
-Don't you masturbate?
-Of course I do.

647
00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:43.404
So. it's okay for you.
but it's not okay for me?

648
00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:47.341
The point is. I don't masturbate
instead of having sex with you.

649
00:31:50.879 --> 00:31:53.013
Okay. Um...

650
00:31:55.949 --> 00:31:59.319
We should go to bed. Let's just
talk about this in the morning.

651
00:32:02.657 --> 00:32:03.858
It's-- [frustrated sigh]

652
00:32:03.957 --> 00:32:06.160
[sentimental music playing]

653
00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:27.147
[music turns unsettling]

654
00:32:33.987 --> 00:32:36.156
[birds chirping]

655
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.503
[water running]

656
00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:52.941
Oh. Sorry.

657
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.709
Good morning.

658
00:32:55.075 --> 00:32:57.177
[chuckling nervously]
I'm so sorry.

659
00:32:57.277 --> 00:32:59.747
It's okay. it's okay.
I'm not shy.

660
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.519
I-- Yeah. I was not expecting
to see anyone out here.

661
00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.922
I mean. it's exhilarating
how vulnerable you feel

662
00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:12.226
to be out in nature.
totally exposed.

663
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.231
You should try it.

664
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.072
I'm gonna go inside.

665
00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.475
Hey. we're making brunch.
You and Diego should join.

666
00:33:28.576 --> 00:33:30.812
-[Sage] This is incredible.
-[Cin] Mimosa?

667
00:33:30.912 --> 00:33:32.212
-[Sage] Yeah. Yes!
-[Cin] Yeah?

668
00:33:32.312 --> 00:33:34.716
-Okay. Wow.
-[Sage] Oh. my God.

669
00:33:34.816 --> 00:33:36.618
-[Diego] Wow.
-[Will] Really.

670
00:33:36.718 --> 00:33:37.952
completely my pleasure.

671
00:33:38.051 --> 00:33:40.020
Yeah. you outdid yourself. baby.

672
00:33:41.623 --> 00:33:43.123
Fuck it. [clears throat]

673
00:33:43.223 --> 00:33:45.927
I have something I need to say.

674
00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:47.327
Something I need to do.

675
00:33:47.427 --> 00:33:48.596
[Cin] Huh?

676
00:33:48.696 --> 00:33:50.230
Uh... And...

677
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.100
Now seems like
a really good time.

678
00:33:54.936 --> 00:33:56.069
Uh...

679
00:33:56.169 --> 00:33:57.772
Actually...

680
00:33:58.573 --> 00:33:59.774
Cin?

681
00:34:02.677 --> 00:34:03.912
Oh. Will.

682
00:34:04.012 --> 00:34:05.513
Cin.

683
00:34:08.482 --> 00:34:11.753
You are the only woman
I have ever loved.

684
00:34:13.387 --> 00:34:17.424
It's like time didn't even exist
until we were together.

685
00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:21.829
I was gonna propose
somewhere romantic

686
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:25.232
like down by the lake at sunset.

687
00:34:25.332 --> 00:34:27.902
but I just couldn't help myself.

688
00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:29.871
I just... I looked at you.

689
00:34:29.971 --> 00:34:31.739
and I just
have to do it right now.

690
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:33.608
This is my grandmother's ring.

691
00:34:36.945 --> 00:34:38.111
It's beautiful.

692
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.080
[tense music playing]

693
00:34:43.952 --> 00:34:45.085
Will you marry me?

694
00:34:45.185 --> 00:34:46.453
[Cin] Yeah!

695
00:34:46.554 --> 00:34:47.421
[Will] Yes?

696
00:34:47.522 --> 00:34:48.255
Yes!

697
00:34:48.355 --> 00:34:49.691
-Yes?
-Yes.

698
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:51.425
[chuckles]

699
00:34:51.526 --> 00:34:52.627
You guys.

700
00:34:52.727 --> 00:34:54.028
[Will] Let me put it on.

701
00:34:54.394 --> 00:34:55.530
-[Sage] Aw!
-[Will] Okay.

702
00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.065
I'm shaking.

703
00:34:57.431 --> 00:35:00.334
-And yes. it fits.
-I love you.

704
00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:02.202
-I love you.
-I love you.

705
00:35:04.471 --> 00:35:05.673
Oh.

706
00:35:05.773 --> 00:35:07.742
[Cin laughing]

707
00:35:07.842 --> 00:35:09.777
[Cin] Diego. Look at it.

708
00:35:09.877 --> 00:35:11.579
[Sage] Well done. Will.

709
00:35:12.046 --> 00:35:14.782
-Should we toast. I guess?
-[Cin] Yes.

710
00:35:14.882 --> 00:35:16.918
Cheers to this awesome weekend?

711
00:35:17.018 --> 00:35:19.721
-Yes. to us.
-[Cin] To a life together.

712
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:20.888
To planning a wedding.

713
00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:22.924
[Will] To planning one day--

714
00:35:23.024 --> 00:35:25.059
Will. can I...
Can I talk to you?

715
00:35:25.158 --> 00:35:26.527
Can't it wait
till after the toast?

716
00:35:26.628 --> 00:35:28.963
No. it can't wait.
I wanna talk right fucking now.

717
00:35:29.063 --> 00:35:31.164
I mean. this is kind
of a bad time.

718
00:35:31.264 --> 00:35:32.600
It just definitely can't wait!

719
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.735
[Sage] Diego.

720
00:35:33.835 --> 00:35:34.636
What are you doing?

721
00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:37.071
Oh. no. no. no. I...

722
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.372
I know what this is about.

723
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.875
Give me one second. okay?

724
00:35:41.308 --> 00:35:43.443
We'll be back. Just one minute.

725
00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:51.351
[sighs]

726
00:35:53.387 --> 00:35:56.390
-You okay. dude?
-[scoffs] "Are you okay?"

727
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.159
Am I okay? What the fuck
is wrong with you?

728
00:35:59.259 --> 00:36:01.294
Look. I am so sorry.

729
00:36:01.395 --> 00:36:03.363
-I fucked up. All right?
-That's an understatement.

730
00:36:03.463 --> 00:36:05.298
You stole my grandmother's ring

731
00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:08.036
and used it to propose
to your girlfriend.

732
00:36:08.136 --> 00:36:09.202
I know.

733
00:36:09.302 --> 00:36:10.672
I just needed to say it out loud

734
00:36:10.772 --> 00:36:13.407
so I could make sure
you hear how insane it is.

735
00:36:13.508 --> 00:36:16.911
Look. look. There's no excusing
what I've done.

736
00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:19.246
-but can I at least explain?
-No!

737
00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:20.515
I don't want an explanation.

738
00:36:20.615 --> 00:36:23.017
Just go tell her the truth
right now.

739
00:36:23.117 --> 00:36:24.118
or I'm going to.

740
00:36:24.217 --> 00:36:25.218
Look. man. our relationship

741
00:36:25.318 --> 00:36:26.821
isn't as perfect as it seems.

742
00:36:26.921 --> 00:36:28.556
No shit! Is it maybe because

743
00:36:28.656 --> 00:36:30.223
you're out of your fucking mind?

744
00:36:30.323 --> 00:36:31.959
Don't say that. Diego.

745
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.227
Don't say that. That's not nice.

746
00:36:34.327 --> 00:36:35.697
Man. I'm not a bad guy. okay?

747
00:36:35.797 --> 00:36:38.833
Even if it seems like that
at the moment.

748
00:36:38.933 --> 00:36:40.835
I'm just desperate.

749
00:36:40.935 --> 00:36:43.037
I'm scared of losing her.

750
00:36:43.705 --> 00:36:48.442
Man. she supports me
emotionally and financially.

751
00:36:50.778 --> 00:36:53.413
I'm sorry.
but there's nothing you can say

752
00:36:53.514 --> 00:36:56.416
to justify what you just did.
I'm leaving.

753
00:36:56.517 --> 00:36:58.753
Man. she's cheating on me.

754
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.622
Do you know
what that feels like.

755
00:37:01.723 --> 00:37:04.058
to have the person you would do
anything for

756
00:37:04.158 --> 00:37:05.292
cheat on you?

757
00:37:05.793 --> 00:37:09.429
When I saw the ring.
I saw the answer.

758
00:37:09.864 --> 00:37:12.432
I needed her to see
that I believed in her.

759
00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:15.268
and I needed to see
that she believes in me.

760
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.405
[sighs] Look. I shouldn't
have taken it. man.

761
00:37:19.107 --> 00:37:22.009
I shouldn't have taken it.
It was a shitty thing to do.

762
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.979
But please. please don't...

763
00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:27.115
Don't make me
tell her right now.

764
00:37:27.447 --> 00:37:30.618
I mean. this whole thing
is so fragile.

765
00:37:32.385 --> 00:37:34.454
God. you and Sage
don't know this

766
00:37:34.555 --> 00:37:37.725
because you just don't have
to deal with this kind of shit.

767
00:37:37.825 --> 00:37:40.228
[sniffling]

768
00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:41.996
[sighs]

769
00:37:42.096 --> 00:37:44.699
[sniffling]

770
00:37:54.175 --> 00:37:55.576
[sighs]

771
00:37:57.979 --> 00:38:01.549
When Sage and I had been
together for a few months only.

772
00:38:01.983 --> 00:38:03.951
she slept with her ex.

773
00:38:06.319 --> 00:38:09.123
It wasn't premeditated.
He just...

774
00:38:09.624 --> 00:38:13.127
came up to see her unexpectedly.
and she let it happen.

775
00:38:13.528 --> 00:38:15.530
Oh. I'm sorry. man.

776
00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:22.302
When she told me. I was crushed.

777
00:38:22.904 --> 00:38:25.472
I thought she had ruined
the perfect thing.

778
00:38:28.242 --> 00:38:30.377
It took time...

779
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:33.047
but we got past it.

780
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:37.718
-Really?
-I've had a great relationship.

781
00:38:38.052 --> 00:38:41.289
And I didn't have to steal
anybody's ring.

782
00:38:41.421 --> 00:38:43.323
[Will sighs]

783
00:38:43.423 --> 00:38:47.228
Look. I promise
I'll get her ring back

784
00:38:47.327 --> 00:38:48.863
before the weekend is through.

785
00:38:48.963 --> 00:38:50.998
I just need a little time.

786
00:38:51.364 --> 00:38:52.934
-[sighs]
-[sniffles]

787
00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:56.938
Hey. hey. hey. I fucked up.
I fucked up. I fucked up.

788
00:39:01.075 --> 00:39:02.409
Look. [sniffles]

789
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.978
I... I'll make sure

790
00:39:04.078 --> 00:39:07.982
that Cin gets Edmund Kerns
to read your writing.

791
00:39:08.481 --> 00:39:11.052
I know that doesn't
make up for what I did.

792
00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:15.623
but I feel like we can
help each other out.

793
00:39:17.258 --> 00:39:19.426
Thank you so much
for helping me clean up.

794
00:39:19.527 --> 00:39:21.128
Of course. You guys cooked.

795
00:39:21.229 --> 00:39:22.830
Well. it was all Will. but...

796
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:23.831
[door opens]

797
00:39:23.931 --> 00:39:25.032
-Hi.
-Thank you.

798
00:39:25.132 --> 00:39:26.234
You didn't have to do that.

799
00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:27.869
Is everything okay?

800
00:39:28.401 --> 00:39:31.438
Diego knew
that I was gonna propose.

801
00:39:31.539 --> 00:39:33.741
He helped me plan
something elaborate.

802
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:37.111
and then I just took him
by surprise. that's all.

803
00:39:37.477 --> 00:39:40.047
I told him to make sure
I didn't fuck it up.

804
00:39:40.147 --> 00:39:42.083
and then I fucked it up.

805
00:39:42.482 --> 00:39:44.685
[Cin] No. babe.
it was the perfect proposal.

806
00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:47.889
I told him that
once I set my mind on something.

807
00:39:47.989 --> 00:39:50.191
-I just gotta do it.
-[Cin] Can't be stopped.

808
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.459
-Right.
-He did everything I asked.

809
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.862
-It's not his fault.
-Well. Sage and I were talking.

810
00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:57.164
and I think we're running low
on supplies.

811
00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.267
[Sage] Yeah. we need to make
sure we have enough food

812
00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:01.602
to be able to stay
the full weekend. right?

813
00:40:01.702 --> 00:40:02.770
-[Will] Hm.
-[Sage] Yeah.

814
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.472
I mean. you guys
have been so nice

815
00:40:05.573 --> 00:40:07.375
letting us eat your food.

816
00:40:07.474 --> 00:40:10.745
and I just wanna do
something in return.

817
00:40:10.845 --> 00:40:12.780
This would be us chipping in.

818
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.749
[Cin] Thank you both.
That's so nice of you.

819
00:40:14.849 --> 00:40:16.449
[Will] That's. uh...
That's amazing.

820
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.619
[Cin] So. I'll drive her
to that little general store

821
00:40:18.719 --> 00:40:20.388
that we saw on the way up.

822
00:40:20.487 --> 00:40:23.024
[Will] Babe. yes.
that sounds very nice.

823
00:40:23.124 --> 00:40:27.161
And I could take her.
I gotta fill the car up anyway.

824
00:40:27.261 --> 00:40:28.396
[Cin] Is that okay?

825
00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:30.598
-Can you do that?
-I'll come along.

826
00:40:30.698 --> 00:40:33.901
[Cin] No. Stay
and keep me company.

827
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:35.803
Yeah. I don't mind.
I'll go with them.

828
00:40:35.903 --> 00:40:37.371
-Stay.
-[Sage] You don't have to come.

829
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.774
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. I'm fine. Stay here.

830
00:40:39.874 --> 00:40:41.375
[clattering]

831
00:40:41.474 --> 00:40:42.910
-[Will] All right.
-Clean up the rest?

832
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.844
Yeah. sure.

833
00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:51.519
[Sage] The weather says
there might be a storm coming.

834
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:58.025
[sighs] Can I ask you
a personal question?

835
00:41:00.695 --> 00:41:02.630
Do you trust Diego?

836
00:41:04.598 --> 00:41:07.068
Yeah. of course.

837
00:41:08.468 --> 00:41:10.004
Okay.

838
00:41:10.104 --> 00:41:12.239
Why would you ask that?

839
00:41:13.473 --> 00:41:17.545
Cin told me
something happened between them.

840
00:41:17.645 --> 00:41:19.914
[groans] I don't know.
I feel like sometimes

841
00:41:20.014 --> 00:41:23.784
she's just trying to make me
jealous or something.

842
00:41:26.454 --> 00:41:28.222
Well. what'd she say?

843
00:41:28.322 --> 00:41:33.561
She said that Diego told her

844
00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:39.133
that you had an affair
early on in your relationship.

845
00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:43.270
and that you owe him one.

846
00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:46.707
Kind of insinuating
that if she was interested.

847
00:41:46.807 --> 00:41:49.977
that she could be the one.

848
00:41:52.413 --> 00:41:54.615
[ominous music playing]

849
00:42:11.632 --> 00:42:12.967
What are you looking at?

850
00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:17.471
Uh. just looking
for the best writing sample

851
00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:19.173
for you to share with
Edmund Kerns.

852
00:42:19.273 --> 00:42:22.376
I hope you're not stressing
about that. Diego.

853
00:42:22.943 --> 00:42:26.247
I need Sage. I need Sage
to take a look at this. I...

854
00:42:30.484 --> 00:42:32.853
What I'm about to say
might be...

855
00:42:34.822 --> 00:42:36.957
a little hard for you to hear.

856
00:42:38.192 --> 00:42:39.293
But...

857
00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:44.331
During one of my first
conversations with Sage. I...

858
00:42:44.932 --> 00:42:48.135
I mentioned that you must be
a really talented writer.

859
00:42:49.603 --> 00:42:51.739
Diego. she didn't say anything.

860
00:42:54.543 --> 00:42:56.444
Oh.

861
00:42:56.545 --> 00:42:59.146
She wants to believe in you.

862
00:42:59.713 --> 00:43:02.783
She wishes
that she believed in you.

863
00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:06.887
But you know.

864
00:43:09.957 --> 00:43:11.659
You know that she doesn't.

865
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:15.229
Um...

866
00:43:16.565 --> 00:43:19.834
No. I... I don't know that.

867
00:43:19.934 --> 00:43:22.504
You know. um.
Sage upended her life

868
00:43:22.603 --> 00:43:24.238
to give me a chance
as a writer.

869
00:43:24.338 --> 00:43:26.107
And I'm not gonna let her down.

870
00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:33.714
Do you wanna know something

871
00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:35.616
your favorite author
said to me once?

872
00:43:36.016 --> 00:43:38.786
I'm sure you know
he's been married for 40 years.

873
00:43:39.153 --> 00:43:41.288
but I bet you didn't know that
before he starts a new book.

874
00:43:41.388 --> 00:43:42.756
he finds a new muse.

875
00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:49.230
[Will] Have you guys
discussed that kind of thing?

876
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.099
God. I can't believe
he said that. Um...

877
00:43:52.199 --> 00:43:56.704
No. No. I don't...
I don't owe him one.

878
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.542
Look.

879
00:44:00.941 --> 00:44:05.312
Cin has this effect on men.

880
00:44:06.747 --> 00:44:11.051
You wanna create
something extraordinary. right?

881
00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:13.154
Yeah.

882
00:44:13.721 --> 00:44:16.123
Then you need someone
who believes in you.

883
00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:18.959
Someone who sees you

884
00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:22.429
like the extraordinary human
that you are.

885
00:44:24.098 --> 00:44:25.766
Sage doesn't.

886
00:44:30.804 --> 00:44:33.374
I could be your muse.

887
00:44:34.074 --> 00:44:38.679
[stammering] Why... Why...
Why are you doing this?

888
00:44:38.779 --> 00:44:42.449
Who were you thinking
about in the bath?

889
00:44:45.052 --> 00:44:46.187
What?

890
00:44:46.287 --> 00:44:48.189
Diego told me that. uh.

891
00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:50.424
he caught you

892
00:44:50.525 --> 00:44:52.059
pleasuring yourself.

893
00:44:53.562 --> 00:44:55.796
[chuckling nervously]

894
00:44:57.566 --> 00:44:58.567
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:00.367
[Will chuckles]

896
00:45:00.467 --> 00:45:02.169
[chuckling] What?

897
00:45:02.269 --> 00:45:06.273
I think that he is worried
that he's not...

898
00:45:07.241 --> 00:45:08.677
satisfying you.

899
00:45:09.009 --> 00:45:11.912
And I think that he knows that

900
00:45:12.012 --> 00:45:13.814
you were thinking
about someone else

901
00:45:13.914 --> 00:45:16.817
while you were
touching yourself.

902
00:45:21.355 --> 00:45:25.359
Look. whatever Diego...

903
00:45:25.459 --> 00:45:26.927
[chuckling nervously]

904
00:45:27.027 --> 00:45:28.495
Whatever he shared with Cin.

905
00:45:28.597 --> 00:45:29.897
and regardless of what

906
00:45:29.997 --> 00:45:33.133
he clearly shared with you. I...

907
00:45:34.935 --> 00:45:37.738
You just got engaged.
didn't you?

908
00:45:39.073 --> 00:45:41.075
Why are you coming on to me?

909
00:45:41.175 --> 00:45:44.745
Oh. I...
I wasn't coming on to you.

910
00:45:47.748 --> 00:45:49.917
[tense music playing]

911
00:45:51.218 --> 00:45:55.022
[Cin] Relax. You're so tense.

912
00:45:55.122 --> 00:45:57.525
There's so much time
until they get back.

913
00:45:57.626 --> 00:45:59.827
[tense music playing]

914
00:46:03.831 --> 00:46:05.866
Do you wanna know
a secret. Diego?

915
00:46:06.934 --> 00:46:09.169
We all have impostor syndrome.

916
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.807
I... I apologize
if I misread the situation.

917
00:46:15.409 --> 00:46:17.211
But I don't think I did.

918
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:19.313
[clears throat]

919
00:46:23.752 --> 00:46:25.853
What are you doing?

920
00:46:28.088 --> 00:46:30.525
[tense music continues]

921
00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:39.333
Look. are... Are you afraid
of what I might do.

922
00:46:39.768 --> 00:46:43.304
or are you afraid of
what you wanna do?

923
00:46:46.173 --> 00:46:47.676
Can I make an observation?

924
00:46:47.776 --> 00:46:49.943
[tense music continues]

925
00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:54.248
<i>Diego is a great guy.</i>

926
00:46:56.584 --> 00:47:00.254
I think you're lonely.

927
00:47:00.354 --> 00:47:03.525
I think you know
that I could be there for you.

928
00:47:04.592 --> 00:47:06.827
[tense music continues]

929
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.670
You have permission to touch me.

930
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.839
I think your panties
are soaking wet

931
00:47:19.206 --> 00:47:22.644
at the fleeting thoughts
you'll allow to enter your brain

932
00:47:23.043 --> 00:47:25.580
of all the things
that we would do to each other.

933
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.881
[music intensifies]

934
00:47:33.954 --> 00:47:35.557
If you would just...

935
00:47:36.691 --> 00:47:38.058
let yourself.

936
00:47:39.993 --> 00:47:42.196
[music fades out]

937
00:47:43.464 --> 00:47:44.932
[kissing and moaning]

938
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:49.537
[upbeat music playing]

939
00:47:49.637 --> 00:47:52.139
[man and woman moaning]

940
00:48:21.803 --> 00:48:22.804
[chimes]

941
00:48:22.903 --> 00:48:24.639
[Cin] Oh. shit. We gotta go.

942
00:48:24.739 --> 00:48:26.373
They'll be here soon.

943
00:48:28.543 --> 00:48:30.110
[dramatic music playing]

944
00:49:06.748 --> 00:49:08.449
Oh. shit.

945
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.585
Uh. give me the keys.

946
00:49:12.787 --> 00:49:15.022
[thunder rumbling]

947
00:49:18.992 --> 00:49:21.995
-Hey. Diego. Is Cin upstairs?
-Uh. yeah.

948
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:24.532
-Hey.
-What?

949
00:49:25.065 --> 00:49:27.167
It felt like you were gone
a really long time.

950
00:49:27.569 --> 00:49:29.336
I don't feel like
we were gone for that long.

951
00:49:31.573 --> 00:49:33.641
[thunder rumbling]

952
00:49:40.113 --> 00:49:42.316
[soft classical music playing]

953
00:50:01.803 --> 00:50:03.070
[sniffles]

954
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.441
[door opens]

955
00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:08.643
[Cin] Hey.

956
00:50:08.743 --> 00:50:10.277
Hey. [sniffles]

957
00:50:11.378 --> 00:50:13.080
I wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

958
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.917
I get the sense
that things have been weird.

959
00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:17.619
What's going on?

960
00:50:19.787 --> 00:50:22.055
Did Diego come on to you?

961
00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:29.797
I don't think
you should ask questions

962
00:50:29.898 --> 00:50:31.666
you don't want the answer to.

963
00:50:31.766 --> 00:50:35.603
What did you and Cin do
while me and Sage were gone?

964
00:50:36.403 --> 00:50:38.573
I don't know. small talk.

965
00:50:39.607 --> 00:50:41.141
That's interesting.

966
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.211
Cin hates small talk.

967
00:50:45.178 --> 00:50:47.381
So much more fun
to get personal.

968
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:52.219
Would you want to know if Will
did something he shouldn't have?

969
00:50:54.187 --> 00:50:55.455
Would you want Diego to know

970
00:50:55.557 --> 00:50:57.692
if you did something
you shouldn't have?

971
00:50:59.226 --> 00:51:01.829
How are you gonna get
my ring back?

972
00:51:02.396 --> 00:51:05.533
[chuckles]
I'm working on it. okay?

973
00:51:05.633 --> 00:51:06.668
I'm working on it.

974
00:51:06.768 --> 00:51:09.469
When Diego and I first met.

975
00:51:10.038 --> 00:51:13.140
I was-- I had just broken up
with this guy.

976
00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.076
He was my first love. Anyway.

977
00:51:16.176 --> 00:51:22.784
Sean. the guy. my ex.
came to my apartment. and...

978
00:51:24.384 --> 00:51:26.621
I should've stopped him. but...

979
00:51:26.721 --> 00:51:29.624
But you didn't. right?

980
00:51:29.724 --> 00:51:33.728
We had sex. he left.
and I never saw him again.

981
00:51:34.963 --> 00:51:36.096
You didn't do anything wrong.

982
00:51:36.196 --> 00:51:37.832
You were just playing a game

983
00:51:37.932 --> 00:51:39.232
with different rules.

984
00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:42.169
Diego. Diego. Diego.

985
00:51:44.973 --> 00:51:46.908
You wanna play chess?

986
00:51:47.008 --> 00:51:48.175
[groans softly]

987
00:51:48.275 --> 00:51:50.277
I don't play games.

988
00:51:50.377 --> 00:51:55.382
I think you should take this.

989
00:51:58.786 --> 00:52:00.922
-Molly?
-Mm-hmm.

990
00:52:01.254 --> 00:52:04.224
-That's your solution?
-[giggles] That's my solution.

991
00:52:04.993 --> 00:52:06.794
Take this.

992
00:52:06.894 --> 00:52:09.664
and for the night. we'll just
forget about what you did.

993
00:52:09.764 --> 00:52:13.801
forget about what Diego did.
and just have fun.

994
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:18.039
-Okay.
-Okay. count of three.

995
00:52:18.138 --> 00:52:19.774
-One.
-Two.

996
00:52:19.874 --> 00:52:21.241

-Three.

1002
00:52:28.148 --> 00:52:29.282
...good to me.

1003
00:52:29.383 --> 00:52:30.885
I want to connect to him

1004
00:52:30.985 --> 00:52:32.587
the way that I used to.

1005
00:52:32.687 --> 00:52:34.889
but lately.

1006
00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:37.391
when we have sex. I fake it.

1007
00:52:39.594 --> 00:52:40.728
What?

1008
00:52:42.063 --> 00:52:43.698
You do?

1009
00:52:44.666 --> 00:52:45.900
Yeah.

1010
00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:49.837
Oh. Sage.

1011
00:52:51.304 --> 00:52:53.473
This is kind of like
a game of chess.

1012
00:52:53.574 --> 00:52:56.811
How am I gonna
get your ring back?

1013
00:52:56.911 --> 00:52:59.781
I'm gonna outsmart my opponent.

We did!

-Baby? Can I have some?
-Yeah?

1026
00:53:27.542 --> 00:53:29.844
No. you're not invited
to partake.

1027

Neither of you are.
It's ladies' night.

I bought it.

would you just relax. Diego?

1049

Just respect ladies' night.
They're gonna be fine.

00:54:38.846 --> 00:54:40.181
Hey.

1051
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.983
[chuckles] Hm.

1052
00:54:42.382 --> 00:54:44.752
Sage. I'm so glad I met you.

1053
00:54:44.852 --> 00:54:46.888
[thunder rumbling]

1054
00:54:47.755 --> 00:54:50.258
What happened
with you and Diego?

[giggles]

1056
00:54:52.994 --> 00:54:55.029
Cin. I need to know.

1057
00:54:55.997 --> 00:54:57.031
Sage.

1058
00:54:58.132 --> 00:54:59.332
Hey.

1059
00:55:06.707 --> 00:55:08.308
-I'm gonna go check on them.
-Hey. hey. hey.

1060
00:55:08.408 --> 00:55:10.443
I don't think you should.
I don't think you should.

1061
00:55:10.545 --> 00:55:11.846
I wasn't asking
for your opinion.

1062
00:55:11.946 --> 00:55:14.148
No. listen to me.
listen to me. listen to me.

1063
00:55:14.248 --> 00:55:17.518
You don't have
to take my advice. but...

1064
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:20.254
I really think you should give
Sage a little space right now.

1065
00:55:20.353 --> 00:55:22.455
Let her enjoy the drugs.

1066
00:55:22.557 --> 00:55:26.359
Cin's gonna take
really good care of her.

1067
00:55:27.195 --> 00:55:29.362
I'm gonna go check on her.

1068
00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:33.968
[dramatic music playing]

1069
00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:36.637
Sage!

1070
00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.114
Sage!

1071
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:50.618
Sage!

[suspenseful music playing]

1073
00:56:02.129 --> 00:56:03.531
Sage?

1074
00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:09.971
[Cin] Diego.

1075
00:56:11.973 --> 00:56:12.974
Where's Sage?

1076
00:56:14.609 --> 00:56:16.043
Somewhere out here.

1077
00:56:16.143 --> 00:56:18.746
What have you been doing?

1078
00:56:18.846 --> 00:56:20.047
Just talking.

1079
00:56:21.282 --> 00:56:22.149

[suspenseful music continues]

1081
00:56:40.067 --> 00:56:41.068

-Hey.
-Hey.

1085
00:57:10.331 --> 00:57:12.333
I was looking for you.
I was worried.

1086
00:57:12.432 --> 00:57:13.801
I was with Cin.

1087
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:15.569
We should leave as soon
as the storm passes.

1088
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.105
Is there something
that you need to tell me?

1089
00:57:18.205 --> 00:57:19.740
Like. did something happen?

1090
00:57:20.274 --> 00:57:23.476
We can talk about it after
you come down from the Molly.

1091
00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:27.682
-I don't know who to trust.
-Why would you say that?

1092
00:57:27.782 --> 00:57:28.783
Oh. shit.

1093
00:57:28.883 --> 00:57:30.651
Diego. I need
to tell you something.

1094
00:57:30.751 --> 00:57:32.219
-What?
-I-- [gasps]

1095
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.387
Oh. my God!

1096
00:57:33.486 --> 00:57:35.423
-It's just us.
-[Cin] Hi.

1097
00:57:35.523 --> 00:57:37.158
We weren't sure
where you guys were.

1098
00:57:37.258 --> 00:57:41.262
You left me all alone. Sage.
So. so cold out there.

1099
00:57:41.362 --> 00:57:43.831
Yeah. I... I needed to get dry.

1100
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:46.534
Storm must have taken down
the power lines.

1101
00:57:46.634 --> 00:57:48.736
Well. we have a really nice
fireplace going.

1102
00:57:48.836 --> 00:57:49.904
We should stick together.

1103
00:57:50.004 --> 00:57:51.605
Uh. I'm gonna check
the breaker box.

1104
00:57:51.706 --> 00:57:53.341
Maybe lightning
tripped the main breaker.

1105
00:57:53.441 --> 00:57:54.942
No. I bet it's a downed
power line.

1106
00:57:55.042 --> 00:57:57.144
-I'm gonna check it anyway.
-No. no. don't worry. you guys.

1107
00:57:57.244 --> 00:57:58.879
Look after the girls. okay?

1108
00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.716
-[Cin] Okay.
-I'll check the box.

1109
00:58:02.482 --> 00:58:04.852
[sighs] Mm.

1110
00:58:04.952 --> 00:58:06.320
Cin. could you give us a second?

1111
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.556
-We need to get dressed.
-[Cin] Yeah.

1112
00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:12.026
I said--
Uh. we'll be very quick. Cin.

1113
00:58:12.126 --> 00:58:13.493
-so I need you--
-I don't want to be alone.

1114
00:58:13.594 --> 00:58:14.862
My eyes are closed.
You can change.

1115
00:58:14.962 --> 00:58:16.397
It's gonna be okay.
It's very quick.

1116
00:58:16.496 --> 00:58:18.165
It's very quick. I promise.

1117
00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:24.839
Why do you think
you can't trust me?

1118
00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.241
Do you trust me?

1119
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:32.780
-What's going on?
-Shh.

1120
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.349
[Diego and Sage
arguing indistinctly]

1121
00:58:35.816 --> 00:58:37.451
You weren't supposed
to leave them alone.

1122
00:58:37.551 --> 00:58:39.186
[whispering] I had to.

1123
00:58:39.754 --> 00:58:41.956
Would've been suspicious
if I didn't.

1124
00:58:42.056 --> 00:58:45.192
[sighs] [whispering] I thought
this would be over by now.

1125
00:58:46.027 --> 00:58:50.464
They've been a challenge.
It's so much more fun that way.

1126
00:58:50.564 --> 00:58:51.832
[Sage] Fuck you!
I know there's something

1127
00:58:51.932 --> 00:58:53.834
going on between you and Cin!

1128
00:58:53.934 --> 00:58:57.872
-Did you fuck her or not?
-I swear to God I didn't!

1129
00:58:57.972 --> 00:58:59.573
I don't believe you. Diego!

1130
00:58:59.673 --> 00:59:02.043
I don't believe a word that
comes out of your mouth!

1131
00:59:02.143 --> 00:59:04.111
Just calm down. please.

1132
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:06.113
-Listen to me.
-I'm not gonna listen to you.

1133
00:59:06.213 --> 00:59:09.717
I don't ever wanna see you
or speak to you again!

1134
00:59:09.817 --> 00:59:12.686
Sage. wait! Where are you going?

1135
00:59:13.054 --> 00:59:16.357
Guys. guys. I need your help.
Sage and I got in a fight.

1136
00:59:16.457 --> 00:59:18.626
It wasn't the circuit breaker.

1137
00:59:18.726 --> 00:59:20.861
-[Cin] What happened?
-You happened! Okay?

1138
00:59:20.961 --> 00:59:23.164
She's fucking pissed.
She ran out.

1139
00:59:23.264 --> 00:59:25.800
Please go look for her. She said
she never wants to see me again.

1140
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.735
Of course we will.
Of course we will.

1141
00:59:27.835 --> 00:59:29.770
-We'll find her.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

1142
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.405
-Yeah.
-Of course.

1143
00:59:31.939 --> 00:59:35.276
-[Cin] Sage? Sage?
-[Will] Sage! Sage!

1144
00:59:36.677 --> 00:59:38.779
Okay. they're gone. Hey.

1145
00:59:41.682 --> 00:59:43.384
Something fucked up
is going on here.

1146
00:59:43.484 --> 00:59:45.119
I know. Yeah. no shit.

1147
00:59:46.153 --> 00:59:48.656
-[sighs]
-I didn't really take the Molly.

1148
00:59:48.756 --> 00:59:50.391
What? Why didn't you
tell me that before?

1149
00:59:50.491 --> 00:59:54.563
'Cause I didn't know if they
were watching or listening.

1150
00:59:54.662 --> 00:59:57.298
These?
It's not a real prescription.

1151
00:59:57.398 --> 00:59:59.667
-What?
-Where are your keys?

1152
00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.502
-Fuck.
-Where are your keys?

1153
01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:03.505
-Uh...
-Where are your keys?

1154
01:00:03.604 --> 01:00:05.606
They're next to my phone.
Here.

1155
01:00:06.107 --> 01:00:08.909
-They were just here!
-They're not there?

1156
01:00:09.009 --> 01:00:11.679
-No.
-Do you think they took them?

1157
01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.515
Seems fucking possible
at this point.

1158
01:00:13.614 --> 01:00:15.049
Okay.

1159
01:00:17.184 --> 01:00:19.320
Okay. I'm gonna
ask you this once.

1160
01:00:20.154 --> 01:00:21.222
Okay.

1161
01:00:21.322 --> 01:00:23.991
Cin and Will both said to me

1162
01:00:24.425 --> 01:00:26.393
that you tried
to sleep with her.

1163
01:00:27.194 --> 01:00:28.062
And that I owe you one

1164
01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:30.030
-because of Sean.
-They're lying.

1165
01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:31.732
-So. just tell me if it's true.
-No. no. no. no.

1166
01:00:31.832 --> 01:00:33.834
They're lying. okay?
I didn't know how to tell you

1167
01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.436
'cause it seems very unlikely.

1168
01:00:35.537 --> 01:00:37.138
but she tried to fuck me.

1169
01:00:37.238 --> 01:00:39.006
I swear to God.
it was so fucking weird.

1170
01:00:39.106 --> 01:00:41.142
-I didn't touch her.
-How did she know about Sean?

1171
01:00:41.242 --> 01:00:43.512
I never mentioned Sean
to her. okay?

1172
01:00:43.612 --> 01:00:45.379
I told Will about
what happened to Sean.

1173
01:00:45.479 --> 01:00:48.482
but not that it meant that
I could sleep with someone else.

1174
01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:52.853
Did you tell Will about me
masturbating in the bath?

1175
01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:55.956
Sage. no. I promise I didn't.

1176

What? What?

1180
01:01:08.802 --> 01:01:10.171
Well. if you didn't tell him.

1181
01:01:10.271 --> 01:01:12.439
there's only one way
he could know.

option. They have our keys.

on fucking with us.

I think they're playing
some kind of a game.

if they want us to play.

I'm gonna break this thing.
I don't wanna leave anything.

1220
01:04:23.765 --> 01:04:26.534
Okay. do you know
what to break? Okay.

1221
01:04:27.968 --> 01:04:31.506
Well done. Well played.

1222
01:04:31.806 --> 01:04:33.240
-[Cin] Bravo.
-[chuckles]

1223
01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.309
You didn't have
to destroy the drive.

1224
01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:37.645
Everything's recorded
in the cloud.

1225
01:04:38.979 --> 01:04:40.381
What are you doing?

1226
01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:41.482
Why are you doing this?

1227
01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:42.684
What the fuck is this?

1228
01:04:42.784 --> 01:04:45.219
It's just a game. Sage.

1229
01:04:45.919 --> 01:04:51.458
Think of it as an opportunity to
prove your love to each other.

1230
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.296
Don't you feel like
everywhere you go.

1231
01:04:56.397 --> 01:04:59.534
everyone you meet
is playing their own game

1232
01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.235
by their own rules.

1233
01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:04.639
and no one ever tells you
what their rules are?

1234
01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:06.273
[chuckles]

1235
01:05:06.808 --> 01:05:08.643
What?

1236
01:05:09.343 --> 01:05:11.044
You guys asked us
to come in here last night.

1237
01:05:11.145 --> 01:05:12.881
What would you have done
if we said yes?

1238
01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.517
I wouldn't have let you
come in here.

1239
01:05:15.617 --> 01:05:17.050
I would have stopped you.

1240
01:05:17.451 --> 01:05:20.421
Sage. almost getting caught
is part of the fun.

1241
01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:22.189
-[Cin chuckles]
-How many fucking times

1242
01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:23.892
-have you done this before?
-[Cin] Six.

1243
01:05:23.991 --> 01:05:25.359
-Six?
-Mm-hm.

1244
01:05:25.459 --> 01:05:27.361
Six including them
or not including them?

1245
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:29.029
They asked how many times
we've done this before.

1246
01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:31.064
-Six. not including them.
-What am I missing?

1247
01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:33.568
Hello? Hello? Okay.
we're out of here. okay?

1248
01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:35.969
We don't care about
your little fucking game.

1249
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:38.005
Give us our key back.

1250
01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:40.441
Wanna know what happens
when you lose?

1251
01:05:40.974 --> 01:05:42.342
No.

1252
01:05:43.912 --> 01:05:45.412
Give me my key back.

1253
01:05:45.513 --> 01:05:46.748
Diego.

1254
01:05:47.314 --> 01:05:50.518
-It's okay.
-If we give you these keys now.

1255
01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:55.189
there are things about us
and things about each other...

1256
01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:58.459
that you're never gonna know.

1257
01:06:01.596 --> 01:06:05.299
-Yeah. we're good. I think.
-[Will] I know you are.

1258
01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:09.203
Diego. don't you wanna know just
a little bit more about Sage?

1259
01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:11.972
We just really
wanna leave. okay?

1260
01:06:12.072 --> 01:06:13.340
Please let us leave.

1261
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.110
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Fair enough.

1262
01:06:19.814 --> 01:06:21.148
-[Will] Go ahead.
-Come on. Sage.

1263
01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:22.951
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1264
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.652
-We're gonna miss you.
-Get out of the--

1265
01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:26.019
-Hey.
-We're gonna miss you.

1266
01:06:26.119 --> 01:06:28.723
-Drive safe.
-We're gonna miss you.

1267
01:06:28.823 --> 01:06:31.425
Hey. give me my ring back.

1268
01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.395
If you leave now. you leave
without the ring. buddy.

1269
01:06:36.831 --> 01:06:38.499
I'll be back for it.

1270
01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:39.634
[growls sarcastically]

1271
01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:41.769
[dramatic music playing]

1272
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:44.939
Fuck. it's unplugged.

1273
01:06:45.038 --> 01:06:46.173
What?

1274
01:06:48.643 --> 01:06:50.645
There's only six miles
in the battery.

1275
01:06:50.745 --> 01:06:53.013
He must have unplugged it
right after I plugged it in.

1276
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.516
Okay. let's just go.

1277
01:06:54.616 --> 01:06:56.885
We're gonna be in the middle
of nowhere in the woods.

1278
01:06:56.985 --> 01:06:58.418
Baby. we have to go.

1279
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.387
We have to just
get the fuck out of here. okay?

1280
01:07:00.487 --> 01:07:02.757
-[knocking on window]
-[Sage] Jesus.

1281
01:07:02.857 --> 01:07:04.458
I fucked her. Diego.

1282
01:07:04.893 --> 01:07:06.426
I fucked her
in the back of my car.

1283
01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:09.062
That's why we were gone
so long earlier.

1284
01:07:12.834 --> 01:07:15.102
He tried. Nothing happened.

1285
01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:17.070
I bet my cum
is still inside of her. man.

1286
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.106
-What?
-He's fucking lying!

1287
01:07:19.206 --> 01:07:20.440
Will you just... Just drive!

1288
01:07:20.542 --> 01:07:22.142
-He's fucking lying!
-No. there is evidence.

1289
01:07:22.744 --> 01:07:24.612
There's video. Diego.

1290
01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:26.748
-He's playing a fucking game!
-[Will] Come back--

1291
01:07:26.848 --> 01:07:28.816
We already won the game. Sage.

1292
01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.384
I fucked you!

1293
01:07:30.484 --> 01:07:33.220
Diego resisted Cin.
but I fucked you.

1294
01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.856
What is this?
You take two people

1295
01:07:34.956 --> 01:07:36.156
that are very fucking in love.

1296
01:07:36.256 --> 01:07:37.892
in a committed.
happy relationship.

1297
01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:39.928
and you just annihilate it?

1298
01:07:40.028 --> 01:07:43.665
Happy and committed
is a stretch. Sage.

1299
01:07:43.765 --> 01:07:47.434
But. yes. we... We... We help...
We help people see the truth.

1300
01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:51.039
Diego. if you leave now...

1301
01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:52.072
-Diego?
-Shut up. shut up.

1302
01:07:52.172 --> 01:07:53.273
-Baby--
-Shut up.

1303
01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.609
Shut up!

1304
01:07:55.777 --> 01:07:58.278
Sage. why didn't you
mention this before?

1305
01:08:00.982 --> 01:08:02.750
You didn't tell me about Cin.

1306
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:04.418
Not at first. but then I did.

1307
01:08:04.519 --> 01:08:07.421
Okay. I didn't
have sex with him.

1308
01:08:07.522 --> 01:08:08.990
I didn't tell you because--

1309
01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:11.124
Because you cheated before.

1310
01:08:13.327 --> 01:08:15.029
-I didn't do this.
-[knocking on window]

1311
01:08:15.128 --> 01:08:17.264
I don't think
he believes you. Sage.

1312
01:08:17.364 --> 01:08:18.600
-I didn't do this.
-Diego.

1313
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.134
I mean. she just
doesn't want you to see

1314
01:08:21.234 --> 01:08:23.136
the things that she did.

1315
01:08:23.236 --> 01:08:25.773
-Baby. please.
-You can't trust her. okay?

1316
01:08:25.873 --> 01:08:29.409
We are not safe here. okay?
We have to go now.

1317
01:08:29.911 --> 01:08:32.547
I love you. I didn't do this.

1318
01:08:37.952 --> 01:08:38.853
I believe her.

1319
01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:40.287
Oh.

1320
01:08:40.387 --> 01:08:43.156
Sage. why don't you tell him
what you told Cin?

1321
01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:47.394
You know what. fuck you
and your game. You lose.

1322
01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:50.798
Just go.

1323
01:08:54.267 --> 01:08:56.303
Baby? Baby! [grunts]

1324
01:08:58.106 --> 01:09:01.308
Oh. fu... Fuck!

1325
01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:04.478

[snaps fingers]

1330
01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:41.082
-Hey. Hey!
-[Cin] Hey. hey.

1331
01:09:41.616 --> 01:09:44.418
Relax.
You're not going anywhere.

1332
01:09:46.186 --> 01:09:48.255
-Come on.
-How's your leg. Diego?

1333
01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:51.258
Remember this?
It was in your car.

1334
01:09:54.162 --> 01:09:55.429
[grunts]

1335
01:09:56.698 --> 01:09:57.799
[groans]

1336
01:10:01.268 --> 01:10:04.237
Why us? We haven't done
anything to you.

1337
01:10:04.337 --> 01:10:08.743
Diego. It's... It's really--
It's nothing personal.

1338
01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:12.146
But if we can destroy
in one weekend

1339
01:10:12.245 --> 01:10:15.850
what it's taken you
years to build.

1340
01:10:16.349 --> 01:10:19.286
I mean. why should you
be together?

1341
01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:22.023
Either you resist us

1342
01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:23.991
and prove
your love to each other

1343
01:10:24.092 --> 01:10:26.761
and live.

1344
01:10:27.195 --> 01:10:29.564
or you wind up at the bottom
of the lake.

1345
01:10:30.865 --> 01:10:33.968
No couple's played our game
and made it till the morning.

1346
01:10:34.836 --> 01:10:36.738
What makes you guys
any different?

1347
01:10:38.673 --> 01:10:41.576
We didn't... We didn't break up.

1348
01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:42.342
[Cin] Oh.

1349
01:10:42.442 --> 01:10:43.310
-Yeah.
-We won!

1350
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:44.712
We won your fucking game!

1351
01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:46.413
We won.
so you have to let us go!

1352
01:10:46.514 --> 01:10:47.949
You have to let us go!

1353
01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:50.985
We have to let them go.
We have to let you go?

1354
01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:52.787
Wake up. Sage.

1355
01:10:52.887 --> 01:10:55.022
All you've done
is lie to each other

1356
01:10:55.123 --> 01:10:57.024
since you got here.

Give me back my phone!

01:11:03.898 --> 01:11:05.298
-Look at that.
-[gasps]

1360
01:11:05.398 --> 01:11:06.734
You have just been approved

1361
01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:10.270
for your next rental stay
in Florida.

1362
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:11.839
-Great place.
-Woo-hoo!

1363
01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.440
[Cin] Wow.

1364
01:11:14.609 --> 01:11:17.912
You'll never show up there.
obviously.

[unsettling music playing]

1366
01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:26.353
Why are you telling us
all of this?

1367
01:11:26.754 --> 01:11:29.524
-Tell them.
-Should I tell them?

1368
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:42.603
[gasps]

1369
01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.675
[Cin] Let's look back. shall we?

1370
01:11:54.282 --> 01:11:55.448

[Diego groaning]

1373
01:12:21.943 --> 01:12:23.945
Have you figured it out?

1374
01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:30.383
My name is Thomas.
and this is Alice.

1375
01:12:32.253 --> 01:12:34.722
Our parents were
Robert and Marilyn Price.

1376
01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:41.494
You read about them. Diego.

1377

Room number two.
in the newspapers?

1378
01:12:44.866 --> 01:12:46.167
Ooh.

1379
01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:51.005
Does that... Does that make
you feel a little outraged?

1380
01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:54.542
Not fit with your worldview?

1381
01:12:54.642 --> 01:12:56.844
[dramatic music playing]

1382
01:12:58.445 --> 01:13:02.516
[Cin] Since we were little. Tom
and I have had a special bond.

1383
01:13:05.253 --> 01:13:07.855
<i>We spent all our time together.</i>

1384
01:13:10.423 --> 01:13:12.693
<i>Not only were we</i>
<i>brother and sister.</i>

1385
01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:15.462
<i>but we were best friends.</i>

1386
01:13:18.532 --> 01:13:21.569
<i>Our mom tried to keep us apart.</i>

1387
01:13:22.803 --> 01:13:26.874
We'd lie together
and fall asleep.

1388
01:13:28.609 --> 01:13:31.012
And our love...

1389
01:13:32.813 --> 01:13:34.548
