00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:58.317
Ah. yeah. but you need one for the other.

337
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.277
This is one of the richest people
on Earth.

338
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.863
He wants courses.
Many. many courses.

339
00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:05.449
-Etiquette is not dead.
-I think etiquette died

340
00:15:05.532 --> 00:15:07.659
four months after
the internet was invented.

341
00:15:07.743 --> 00:15:10.913
and that guy's head went
into an elephant's ass.

342
00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:12.789
-Ah. well.
-[knocking at door]

343
00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:14.499
[whispering] He's early.
He's an early bird.

344
00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:15.918
[Oliver] [whispering]
Okay. okay.

345
00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:20.464
Oh. Jay. welcome.
Come in.

346
00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:22.007
I come bearing gifts.

347
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.383
-Ah.
-Never show up empty-handed.

348
00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:25.761
Though. I'm a little handicapped.
if you don't mind grabbing that.

349
00:15:25.844 --> 00:15:28.764
Oh-ho.
Beer. how generous.

350
00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:33.894
Ah. stoked to meet you all.

351
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.981
One of the reasons why I play cards here
is because it's the murder building.

352
00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:40.692
and that is all because of you.

353
00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:43.236
Well. we give a lot of credit
to the murderers.

354
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.240
Say. so. uh. what has you playing cards
in our famous Velvet Room?

355
00:15:47.324 --> 00:15:50.160
-You know. I started a few months ago...
-[doorbell ringing]

356
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:52.579
-[scoffs]
-[sighs]

357
00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:58.210
Man. I knew I was being followed.

358
00:15:58.293 --> 00:15:59.294
[sighs]

359
00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:03.632
Good evening.
Camila White.

360
00:16:03.715 --> 00:16:05.717
[♪ plucky curious music playing]

361
00:16:06.885 --> 00:16:10.263
Oh. isn't this an assaulting amount
of everything?

362
00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:12.265
[sighs deeply]

363
00:16:12.349 --> 00:16:13.350
Better.

364
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:19.231
Oh. my goodness.

365
00:16:19.314 --> 00:16:21.858
Jay. is that you?

366
00:16:21.942 --> 00:16:24.611
-I had no idea you'd be here.
-Mm-hmm.

367
00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:26.863
Well. I heard the podcast.
and it seemed like these people

368
00:16:26.947 --> 00:16:29.032
thought you were involved
in the mob killing.

369
00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:32.494
Camila White. charmed.
Camila White.

370
00:16:32.577 --> 00:16:35.831
Oh. dear God.
A plum plaid.

371
00:16:37.499 --> 00:16:40.085
So. I'm here to clear Jay's name.

372
00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:42.379
Fuck off. Camila.
I'm here to clear my name.

373
00:16:42.462 --> 00:16:44.256
You were worried about what
I'd say about you.

374
00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:46.633
That is certainly not true.

375
00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:50.429
and I don't like the ugly use of words
that end in hard Ks.

376
00:16:50.512 --> 00:16:52.055
Shall we begin again?

377
00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:53.974
-Softer consonants?
-[doorbell ringing]

378
00:16:55.058 --> 00:16:56.977
[whispering]
Our host brought four chocolates.

379
00:16:59.187 --> 00:17:01.857
Hello.
Sebastian Steed.

380
00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:06.111
No-- I'd invite you in
if I had more chocolates.

381
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.821
[Oliver sighs]

382
00:17:09.197 --> 00:17:11.825
Oh. my God.
You're spying on us.

383
00:17:11.908 --> 00:17:13.410
Of course he is. he owns the internet.

384
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:15.954
Just stopping by for a drink. Bash?

385
00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:19.458
No. I'm here because
they're investigating you.

386
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:21.334
Naturally. I've been
having you followed.

387
00:17:21.418 --> 00:17:23.420
I knew you'd try to pin it on me.

388
00:17:23.503 --> 00:17:26.173
Thanks for your robot-like honesty.

389
00:17:26.256 --> 00:17:27.382
You're welcome.

390
00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:33.930
Well. we're really having a party here.

391
00:17:34.014 --> 00:17:35.265
Please. have a seat.

392
00:17:35.348 --> 00:17:36.349
[Charles] Whoo!

393
00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:41.772
Who needs champagne?

394
00:17:42.522 --> 00:17:43.648
-[grunting]
-[cork popping]

395
00:17:43.732 --> 00:17:45.400
Oh. I'll have a '97 Bordeaux.

396
00:17:46.568 --> 00:17:48.278
-I don't think I have that.
-[Camila] Oh. truly.

397
00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:51.239
any '97 Bordeaux will do.
[softly chuckles]

398
00:17:51.323 --> 00:17:53.784
I don't have <i>any </i>'97 Bordeaux.

399
00:17:55.744 --> 00:18:00.290
So. I'm noticing three
of the richest people in the world

400
00:18:00.373 --> 00:18:02.292
are here in our little building.

401
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:04.044
I'm top three. they're top 20.

402
00:18:04.127 --> 00:18:06.129
Sebastian. on many lists I'm four.

403
00:18:06.213 --> 00:18:09.299
Uh. the point is that you all
seem a little nervous

404
00:18:09.382 --> 00:18:12.219
about what our little
investigation has uncovered.

405
00:18:12.302 --> 00:18:13.887
No one's nervous.

406
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.807
We're all here for one reason.
Yeah?

407
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.142
Yes. To give you the opportunity

408
00:18:19.226 --> 00:18:22.395
to keep us out of your podcast
before we sue you for libel.

409
00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:24.272
[Oliver spits out champagne. chuckles]

410
00:18:24.356 --> 00:18:26.399
Libel. wow.
[laughing]

411
00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:29.528
Let's-- let's just turn down
the temp a tad.

412
00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:31.738
and. uh. let's nibble some caviar--

413
00:18:31.822 --> 00:18:32.906
-[snorts]
-[Jay crunching]

414
00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:34.616
[Oliver] Oh.

415
00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:36.118
[Jay Pflug]
Oops. I'm so sorry.

416
00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:38.495
There really wasn't very much.

417
00:18:38.578 --> 00:18:42.249
It's not libel to say we found you
sniffing around a murder scene.

418
00:18:43.834 --> 00:18:45.669
What do you mean?

419
00:18:45.752 --> 00:18:47.420
The news said that the body was found

420
00:18:47.504 --> 00:18:49.881
hanging from a rack
in his own dry cleaners?

421
00:18:49.965 --> 00:18:52.968
Yes. I-- I don't know why
you're even looking into this.

422
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:56.221
I mean. my people say
you do murders in the building.

423
00:18:56.304 --> 00:18:58.890
It's an odd business model.
this "in the building" rule.

424
00:18:58.974 --> 00:19:01.685
Your metrics would improve
with a wider net.

425
00:19:01.768 --> 00:19:04.312
Bash. always be talking metrics.

426
00:19:04.396 --> 00:19:06.439
Well. the dry cleaners
is on the street level.

427
00:19:06.523 --> 00:19:08.775
so technically.
it is "of" the building.

428
00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:12.070
Listen. nobody wants to sue anyone.

429
00:19:12.154 --> 00:19:14.739
We just can't have our names
tied to secret card games

430
00:19:14.823 --> 00:19:16.533
-and dead mobsters. you know?
-[Camila] Mm.

431
00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:19.411
My stock crashes.
and tens of thousands

432
00:19:19.494 --> 00:19:21.538
of indigenous weavers go hungry.

433
00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:22.831
Because she fires 'em.

434
00:19:22.914 --> 00:19:25.333
Yes. why else would they go hungry?

435
00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:29.963
So. the three of you
knew the "Dry Cleaning King of Brooklyn"?

436
00:19:30.046 --> 00:19:32.549
The dead mobster?
Not at all.

437
00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:34.593
I know he owned the gaming parlor.

438
00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:38.805
The mobby shit's always been part
of what makes the place so cool.

439
00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:40.682
What's there to investigate?

440
00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:44.186
A mob hit is very open and shut.
Won't be your best season.

441
00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:47.272
Well. we're also investigating
the death of our doorman.

442
00:19:47.355 --> 00:19:48.356
Did you know him?

443
00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:53.778
I mean. there was a guy
who always covered the door

444
00:19:53.862 --> 00:19:56.114
for the Saturday games.
Uh. gray mustache?

445
00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:58.617
That was Lester.
It was ruled natural causes

446
00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.910
because of a fall.

447
00:19:59.993 --> 00:20:03.997
Yes. falls are the leading cause
of injury deaths in the elderly.

448
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.583
-You two. be careful.
-Our Pilates instructor says we have

449
00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:08.627
-the gait stability of 46-year-olds.
-It's true.

450
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.128
[Bash] If you're serious
about age-reversal.

451
00:20:10.212 --> 00:20:12.797
you have to consider
plasma replacement therapy.

452
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:15.675
I own a stable of teen plasma donors.

453
00:20:16.426 --> 00:20:21.014
We have reason to believe that Nicky
died last week when Lester died.

454
00:20:21.097 --> 00:20:23.308
There were signs that Nicky was frozen.

455
00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:27.229
Someone hid his body to make it
look like they were unrelated.

456
00:20:27.312 --> 00:20:29.898
Oh. you got your hands on the body.

457
00:20:29.981 --> 00:20:30.982
[Jay] Wow.

458
00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:32.275
I mean. can you admit that

459
00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:34.819
on a podcast?
That's a felony. right?

460
00:20:34.903 --> 00:20:37.239
I'm sure they went
to the authorities immediately.

461
00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:38.323
[Camila] Mm.

Mm-hmm. Um. you know what.
let's get you some more caviar.

464
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:46.248
-Mm. Absolutely.
-Let's get it. I think there's more caviar

465
00:20:46.331 --> 00:20:47.332
-in the kitchen.
-I'm good.

466

-[Oliver] We definitely have bologna.
-[Charles] And. uh.

467
00:20:49.251 --> 00:20:51.253
I think there's a fresher bottle.

468
00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:54.881
Okay. okay. okay.
I was not prepared for all three.

469
00:20:54.965 --> 00:20:56.800
Are they making veiled threats
or being charming?

470
00:20:56.883 --> 00:20:57.968
I can't tell.

471
00:20:58.051 --> 00:21:00.762
Let's split them up and see what they say
about Jay's finger.

472
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:02.555
I'll take Jay because we're not old.

473
00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:04.808
And Charles should take Bash
because they're both. well.

474
00:21:04.891 --> 00:21:06.768

a few more questions.

Can I give you a tour?

478
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.071
Fine.

479
00:21:18.822 --> 00:21:22.993
If you can stop yelling.
a tour before dinner.

480
00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:25.745
Dinner!
I said we need dinner.

481
00:21:25.829 --> 00:21:28.248
Of course. a party at 7:00
means dinner.

482
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.126
Thank you. Bash!
Gimme a hand?

483
00:21:32.294 --> 00:21:34.212
If the servants don't mind.

been playing together for long?

All I know about Jay

496
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:15.003
is he has a tantrum
like a toddler when he loses...

497
00:22:15.086 --> 00:22:17.714
-Ooh.
-...which is tragic and amusing.

The hot glue fumes

00:30:49.809 --> 00:30:52.395
from my apartment
jump-started my hangover.

00:30:52.478 --> 00:30:54.146
Does champagne expire?

Oh. you should really
lay off the alcohol.

was in her sexual prime?

First sexual prime. or second?

Jay Pflug's finger in your freezer?

At least we figured that out.

693

So. we're gonna believe
these three?

Oh. please. Camila is no killer.

a couple of hours

and Nanette Fabray. so I almost died.

He was just trying
to protect everyone.

No. I'm n--
Shut up. I'm not fluttering.

we're investigating.

-So. who-- Whose finger is it?

767
00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:07.131

when they told us what happened?

their stories straight.

didn't put in his little bird ledger.
