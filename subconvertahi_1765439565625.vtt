- It's just round the corner. you'll make it.

You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

No. really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

47
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.200
- I love you.
- I know.

48
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.400
I love you even when you're sick
and look disgusting.

49
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.900
I know. Now. go or you will actually miss it.

50
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.900
Right.

51
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.100
- Did I mention that I love you?
- Yes. you did. Get out. loser.

Karen. it's me again.

53
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm sorry. I literally don't have
anybody else to talk to.

54
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.000
Absolutely. Horrible moment. though.
Can I call you back?

55
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.600
Of course.

56
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.500
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

57
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.900
Understood.

58
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.300
Er. bugger off. call me later.

59
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.800
So what's this big news?

60
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.500
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

61
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.400
and I'm the lobster.

62
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.200
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.900
- In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

64
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.400
There was more than one lobster present
at the birth of Jesus?

65
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.500
Duh.

66
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.300
Best sandwiches in Britain.

67
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.800
Try my lovely nuts?

68
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.900
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

69
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.400
Morning. my future wife.

70
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.900
(Man) OK. you can stop there. Thanks.

71
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.400
(2nd man) I need a couple of orange gels.

72
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.800
By the way. he introduced me as John
but everyone calls me Jack.

73
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.100
Oh. fine. Nice to meet you. Jack.

74
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.300
He got me right. though. I'm just Judy.

75
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.900
Great. Just Judy!

76
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.600
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

77
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.200
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

78
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.900
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

79
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.500
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

80
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.700
That is true.

81
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.100
Good luck. kiddo.

82
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.600
(Cheering. applause)

83
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.200
(Press shouting) Prime Minister. over here!

84
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.400
(Cheering)

85
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.500
Thank you.

86
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.400
- Welcome. Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

87

How are you?

88
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.800
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

89
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.100
Cool. Powerful.

90
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.700
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

91
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.600
Yes. I would like that very much indeed.

92
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.100
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

93
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.300
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning. sir.

94
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.100
Good morning.
I had an uncle called Terence.

95
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.300
Hated him. I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

96
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.600
- This is Pat.
- Hello. Pat.

97
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.200
Good morning. sir. I'm the housekeeper.

98
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.900
Oh. right. I should be easier than the last lot.

99
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.800
No nappies. no teenagers. no scary wife.

100
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.700
And this is Natalie. She's new. like you.

101
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.400
- Hello. Natalie.
- Hello. David. I mean. sir.

102
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.900
Shit. I can't believe I've just said that.

103
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.600
And now I've gone and said "shit".
Twice. I'm so sorry. sir.

104
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.100
You could've said "fuck"
and we'd have been in real trouble.

105
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.000
Thank you. sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

106
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.700
Oh. piss it!

107
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.400
Right. I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country. shall we?

108
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.500
Yeah. I can't see why not.

109
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.100
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

110
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200
- Yes. I did.
- I just went "blurh".

111
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.600
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

112
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.000
Yeah. I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

113
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.100
Ah.

114
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.100
(Clears throat)

115
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.500
Oh. no.

116
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.800
That is so inconvenient.

117
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.600
In the presence of God.
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

118
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.300
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

119
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.500
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

120
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.

121
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.600
((Music) Organ plays Wedding March)

122
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.400
And you resisted
the temptation for surprises.

123
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.700
Yeah. I'm mature now.

124
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.800

128
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.000
Er. no.

that can't be done (Music)

131
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.400
Oh. it...

132
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.300
(Music) There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

133
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.400
(Music) There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

134
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.900
(Music) It's easy

135
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.600

(Music) Love is all you need... (Music)

139
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.200
Look. it's Pikey.

140
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.100
Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.000
Oh. I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

142
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.000
- The lady of the house let you in. did she?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.400
- Lovely. obliging girl.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.900
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

145
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.200
- Oh.
- Listen. erm. I've been thinking.

146
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.700
I think we ought to take Mum out for
her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

147
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.400
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

148
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.600
(Girlfriend) Hurry up. big boy!

149
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.700
I'm naked and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

150
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.000
(Music and chatter)

151
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.500
(Juliet) I am so happy to see you!

152
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.600
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er. no. thanks.

153
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.500
Taste explosion?

154
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.600
- Food?
- No. thanks.

155
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.700
Yeah. a bit dodgy. isn't it?

156
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.400
Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.

157
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.000
Oh. Tastes like it. too.

158
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.700
I'm Colin. by the way.

159
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.300
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

160
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.800
- What do you do. Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

161
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.800
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes. I do.

162
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.700
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

163
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.300
- God. I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

164
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.600
(Embarrassed giggle) Right.

165
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.600
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

166
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.200
English girls. They're stuck up. you see.

167
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.000
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler. game for a laugh.

168
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.300
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!

169
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.500
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

170
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.900
I think it's crap. Colin.

171
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.800
That's where you're wrong.

172
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.800
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

173
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes. I do! I'm going to America.

174
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.500
Colin. you're a Ionely. ugly arsehole.
Accept it.

175
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.500
Never. I am Colin. God of Sex.
I'm just on the wrong continent. that's all.

176
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.500
Bit of quiet
while we finish the lighting. guys!

177
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.300
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

178
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.800
Judy. could you take the top off this time?

179
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.000
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the. erm. nipples and when we're not.

180
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.700
Yes. OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

181
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.300
Not always the case. is it?

182
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.000
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years In Tibet...

183
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.300
- Yes. yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

184
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.400
Guys. time's tight
and we have to get the actors in.

185
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.700
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

186
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.700
(Judy laughs)

187
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.600
(Director) Right. let's have
another look at that. please.

188
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.000
Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

189
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.400
- OK. yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

190
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.300
I'll warm them up!

191
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.000
- And massage them. please.
- Right.

192
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.300
It's junction 13 that's just murder. isn't it?
Total gridlock this morning.

193
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.300
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

194
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.900
Some of her requests.

195
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.600
for instance. that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral.

196
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.500
I was confident she expected me to ignore.

197
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.800
But others she was pretty damn clear about.

198
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.400
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen.

199
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.200
I said. "Over my dead body."

200
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.300
And she said. "No. Daniel. over mine."

201
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.500
And as usual. my darling girl...

202
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.600
and Sam's darling mum was right.

203
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.800
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but.

204
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.100
inevitably.

205
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.400
ever so coolly.

206
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.000
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

207
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.400
(On speakers)
(Music) Bye bye baby. baby goodbye

208

(Music) You're the one girl in town I'd marry

212
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.200
(Music) Girl I'd marry you now if I were free

213
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.400
(Music) I wish it could be

214
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.400
(Music) I could love you but why begin it?

215
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600
(Music) Cos there ain't any future in it

216
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.200
(Music) She's got me but I'm not free so... (Music)

217

(Music) Wish I never had known you... (Music)

222
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.300
Do you love him?

223
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.400
Er. er. what?

224
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.200
No. l-I just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

225
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.000
and you needed someone to talk to about it
and no one had ever asked you.

226
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.900
No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

227
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.100
(Music)... on my finger... (Music)

228
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.100
So that's a no. then?

229
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.300
Yes. Erm...

230
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.800
(Music) Bye bye baby. baby goodbye

231
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
(Music) Goodbye baby. baby bye bye... (Music)

232
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.900
This DJ. what do you reckon?

233
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.900
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

234
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.400
I think it all hangs on the next song.

235
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.500
Now here's one for the lovers.

236
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.500
That's quite a few of you.
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

237
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.900
((Music) S Club Juniors: Puppy Love)

238
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.600
(Music) And they called it... (Music)

239
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.700
- He's done it. it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

240
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
(Music) Oh. I guess they'll never know... (Music)

241
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.500
(Knocks)

242
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.300
Sarah's waiting for you.

243
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.900
Oh. yes. of course. erm...

244
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.900
Great. er. good. good.

245
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.100
How are you doing. Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

246
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.000
Absolutely.

247
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.100
- Harry?
- Sarah.

248
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:36.100
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

249
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.000
Two years. seven months.

250
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.700
three days and. I suppose. what. two hours?

251
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.700
And how long have you been in love
with Karl. our enigmatic chief designer?

252
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Um...

253
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.800
Two years. seven months. three days
and. I suppose. an hour and 30 minutes.

254
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.700
Thought as much.

255
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.800
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

256
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.200
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

257
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.200
Oh. that is... that is bad news.

258
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:16.600
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

259
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.200
- Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink

260
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.100
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

261
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.600
- You know that?
- Yes.

262
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.100
And so does Karl.

263
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.600
Think about it. for all our sakes.

264
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.200
It's Christmas.

265
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.200
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

266
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.500
Thanks. boss.

267
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.400
- Hi. Sarah.
- Hi. Karl.

(Mobile)

270
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.200
Babe. Absolutely. fire away.

271
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.600
Mia. Mia. would you turn that down?

272
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.400
What is that?

273
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.100
That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

274
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.100
Oh. dear me. how are the mighty fallen.

275
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.600
I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

276
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Oh. and coincidentally.
I believe Billy will be a guest

277
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.800
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

278
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.100
Welcome back. Bill.

279
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.200
Billy. welcome back to the airwaves.

280
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.400
New Christmas single.
cover of Love Is All Around.

281
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.700
Except we've changed
the word "love" to "Christmas".

282
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.000
Yes. is that an important message
to you. Bill?

283
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.600
(Snorts) Not really. Mike.

284
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.900
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

285
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.600
- And that's not you?
- That's not me. Michael.

286
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.600
When I was young and successful.
I was greedy and foolish

287
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.700
and now I'm left with no one.
wrinkled and alone.

288
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.600
- Wow. Thanks for that. Bill.
- For what?

289
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.500
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

290
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.200
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford. I can tell you.

291
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.100
- Ask me anything. I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

292
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.900
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

293
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.300
No. only kidding! (Snorts)

294
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.800
- She was rubbish.
- OK. here's one.

295
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.300
How do you think the new record
compares to your old. classic stuff?

296
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.900
Come on. Mikey. you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

297
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.800
(Bill laughing)

298
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.200
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

299
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.600
wasn't some smug teenager

300
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.900
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

301
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.600
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

302
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.300
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

303
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.900
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe.

304
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.200
ugliest man in the world.

305
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.600
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.000
So if you believe in Father Christmas.
children. like your Uncle Billy does.

307
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.800
buy my festering turd of a record.

308
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.900
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

309
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.400
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

310
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.900
I think you're referring to

311
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.100
"If you really love Christmas..."

312
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.400
"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.

313
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600
So. here it is one more time.

314
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.000
the dark horse for this year's
Christmas number one.

315

Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you. Billy. After this. the news.

316
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.100
Is the new prime minister in trouble already?

317
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.200
(Music) I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes (Music)

318
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.900
- OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

319
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.100
Ah. yes. yes. I fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play. Alex.

320
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.400
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

321
00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.000
- like the last government.
- (AIl) Here. here.

322
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.200
This is our first really important test.
let's take a stand.

323
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.900
Right. Right. I understand that
but I have decided...

324
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.700
not to. Not this time.

325
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.200
Let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

326
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.900
I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

327
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.500
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

328
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.500
Right.

329
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.300
(Knocking)

330
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.400
Yeah. come in.

331
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.300
- These are from the Treasury...
- Uh-huh.

332
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.400
...and these are for you.

333
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.300
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

334
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.500
I was hoping you'd win. not that
I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke.

335
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.500
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

336
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.400
Thanks very much. Thanks...

337
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.300
Natalie.

338
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.500
God. come on. get a grip.
You're the Prime Minister. for God's sake.

339
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.100
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

340
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.700
Oh. I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married. though.

341
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.900
You know the type. he's married to his job.

342
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.300
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

343
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.600
Excuse me. Judy. if you could
just lower the nipples

344
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.100
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

345
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.100
I have to say. Judy. this is a real pleasure.

346
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.800
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

347
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.900
- Thank you!
- Oh. well. you know.

348
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.700
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

349
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.200
The move again. please. Judy.

350
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.700
- Ooh. sorry.
- Oh. God. sorry. You all right?

351
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.900
- Exciting news!
- What?

352
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.300
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

353
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.800
- No.
- Yes!

354
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

355
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.600
Yes! Wisconsin babes.
here comes Sir Colin!

356
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.900
No. Col! There are a few babes in America.
I grant you.

357
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.800
but they're going out
with rich. attractive guys.

358
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.100
Tone. you're just jealous.

359
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.000
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

360
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.500
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

361
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.200
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

362
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.100
No. I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

363
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.600
- No. Colin. no!
- Yes!

364
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.900
- Nyet!
- Da!

365
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.300
- Nein!
- Ja. darling!

366
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.000
Right. the Christmas party.
not my favourite night of the year

367
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.500
and your unhappy job to organise.

368
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.500
- Tell me.
- It's basic. really.

369
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.300
Find a venue. over-order on the drinks.
bulk buy the guacamole

370
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.400
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

371
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.000
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean. not children.

372
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.600
But their wives and girlfriends. et cetera.

373
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.400
Oh. Christ. you haven't got some horrible
six-foot. tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

374
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.200
No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe.
hoping to be kissed.

375
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.400
Really?

376
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.500
Right.

377
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.700
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean. he'll be up there now.

378
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.400
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

379
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.000
Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

380
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.000
Yeah. but Karen. this is all the time.

381
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.500
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong. you know?

382
00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.700
I mean. clearly it's about his mum

383
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.800
but Christ. he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

384
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.800
(Karen) At the age of 11?

385
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.000
(Daniel) Well. maybe not his eyeballs. then.
Maybe just his veins.

386
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.500
The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him. you know. and...

387
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.400
I don't know. this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

388
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.900
like it never did before.

389
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.600
Listen. it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

390
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.300
Just be patient.

391
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.800
And maybe check the room for needles.

392
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:39.700
And then when he sometimes does
come out. it's obvious he's been crying.

393
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.500
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

394
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.900
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

395
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.100
I just don't know.

396
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.800
Get a grip.

397
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.100
People hate sissies.

398
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.400
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

399
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.400
Yeah. Absolutely.

400
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.500
Helpful.

401
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.000
So. what's the problem. Samuel?

402
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.700
Is it just Mum or is it something else. huh?

403
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.300
Maybe school?

404
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.500
Are you being bullied?

405
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.800
Or is it something worse?

406
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.900
Can you give me any clues at all?

407
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.600
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

408
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.300
Even though you won't be able to help?

409
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.000
Even if that's the case. yeah.

410
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.400
OK. Well...

411
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.400
truth is. actually...

412
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.400
I'm in love.

413
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.000
Sorry?

414
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.600
I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

415
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.900
I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

416
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.100
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

417
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.100
Ah. well. OK. well...

418
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.600
I'm a little relieved.

419
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.900
- Why?
- Because I...

420
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.100
thought it'd be something worse.

421
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.100
Worse than the total agony of being in love?

422
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.900
Er...

423
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.600
No. you're right.

424
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.800
Total agony.

425
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.100
- Night. Sarah.
- Night. Karl.

426
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.600
(Mobile)

427
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Yeah. absolutely.

428
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.400
Free as a bird. Fire away.

429
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.000
Alone again.

430
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.100
Naturally.

431
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.200
- I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

432
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.900
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

433
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.500
Thanks.

434
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.600
Natalie.

435
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.600
Erm. I'm starting to feel...

436
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.500
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

437
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.100
and me knowing so little about you.
it seems elitist and wrong.

438
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.100
Well. there's not much to know.

439
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.700
Well. erm. where do you live. for instance?

440
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.900
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

441
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.300
- Ah. my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

442
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.200
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

443
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.800
At the end of the high street.
Harris Street. near the Queen's Head.

444
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.800
- Oh. yeah. yeah. that is dodgy.
- Hm.

445
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.100
Erm. and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

446
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.400
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

447
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.000
I've just split up with my boyfriend. so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

448
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.400
- Ah. Sorry.
- No. it's fine.

449
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.000
I'm well shot of him.

450
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.800
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.800
He said no one'd fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks.

452
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.500
Not a nice guy. actually. in the end.

453
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
No.

454
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.200
You know. erm...

455
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.100
being Prime Minister.
I could just have him murdered.

456
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.700
Thank you. sir. I'll think about it.

457
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.600
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

458
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.700
Ruthless. trained killers
are just a phone call away.

459
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.500
Oh. God.

460
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.600
Did you have this kind of problem?

461
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.600
Yeah. course you did. you saucy minx.

462
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.000
So. let's go. We can definitely crack this.

463
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.300
Remember. I was a kid once. too.

464
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.700
So. come on. it's someone at school. Right?

465
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.800
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good. good.

466
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.900
And what does she. he. feel about you?

467
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.900
SHE doesn't even know my name.

468
00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.800
And even if she did. she'd despise me.

469
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.300
She's the coolest girl in school.

470
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.400
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

471
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.000
Good. Good.

472
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.500
Well.

473
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.200
basically you're fucked. aren't you?

474
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.700
((Music) All I Want For Christmas Is You)

475
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.900
Hi there and welcome back.

476
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.200
So. three weeks till Christmas. looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

477
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.800
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

478
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.300
No. Little scamps.

479
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.800
But very. very talented musicians.

480
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.200
Yeah. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

481
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.700
Yes. I have. Ant or Dec.

482
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.800
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

483
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.600
Oh. great.

484
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.300
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass.

485
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:43.100
so if you've got a framed picture.
like. for instance. this one of Blue.

486
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.300
you can just write on it.

487
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.100
(Kids snickering)

488
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.900
(Dec) Er. a lot of kids watching. Billy.
(Billy) Oh. yeah.

489
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.900
Hiya. kids.

490
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.300
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

491
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.600
don't buy drugs.

492
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.600
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

493
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.400
And I do believe it's a commercial break.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

494
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.300
(Music) All I want for Christmas is you (Music)

495
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.600
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

496
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.300
Actually. they're not funny. They're art.

497
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.800
(Laughing)

498
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.600
OK. let's say. er. Thursday. my place.

499
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.000
Great. I've got Juliet on the other line.
she wants to ask you a favour.

500
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.000
- (Sighing) OK. fine.
- Thanks and. er. be nice.

501
00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.200
- I'm always nice.
- 'You know what I mean. Marky. be friendly.'

502
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.700
- I'm always...
- (Juliet) 'Mark? '

503
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.700
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

504
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.500
It was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

505
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.200
- So. what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour.'

506
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.200
I've just tried the wedding video
and it's a disaster.

507
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.300
- 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.'
- I'm sorry.

508
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.100
I remember you filming a lot
and I wondered if I could look at it.

509
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.300
To be honest. I didn't really...

510
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.000
Please. All I want is one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

511
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.000
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it.
so don't get any hopes up.

512
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.000
- 'Must go.'
- (Click)

513
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.400
Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

514
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.300
No. I've done fuck-all and never will
because he's too good for me.

515
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.600
How true.

516
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.000
- (Sarah) Stop.
- (Mobile)

517
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.300
And of course. your mobile goes.

518
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.100
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

519
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.000
- So. how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

520
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.300
Think I've found a venue.

521
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.700
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

522
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.900
It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

523
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.100
Oh. Right.

524
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.300
Good. Well. I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

525
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.600
You should.

526
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.400
(Typewriter clacking)

527
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.300
(Bell tinkles)

528
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.200
Ah. bonjour. Eleonore.

529
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.100
Bonjour. Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

530
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.300
And this year you bring a lady guest?

531
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.600
No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

532
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.000
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

533
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.900
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah. yeah.

534
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Good. Well. I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

535
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.800
This is Aurelia.

536
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.900
Ah.

537
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.900
- Er. bonjour. Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

538
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:24.000
(French) Er. je suis. er. tr�s heureux
de vous avoir ici.

539
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.300
Unfortunately. she cannot speak French.
just like you.

540
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.300
She's Portuguese.

541
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.900
(Italian) Ah. ah. buongiorno.

542
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.000
Eusebio. er. er...

543
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.400
(Pidgin Spanish) Er. molto bueno...

544
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.700
I think she's ten years too young
to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

545
00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.200
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

546
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.800
Right.

547
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.600
Anyway. it's nice to meet you and...

548
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.400
Can you drive her home after her work?

549
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.300
Oh. absolutely. yes.
Con-Con grande. er. pl-plesura.

550
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.500
Which is what? Turkish?

551
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.300
(Pidgin Portuguese) Bello.

552
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.100
Er. bella.

553
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.600
Er. mon-montagno.

554
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.700
arvarez...

555
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.200
No. right. Silence is golden.

556
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.500
As the Tremeloes said.

557
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.100
Clever guys.

558
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.300
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

559
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.500
Gr-great band.

560
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.100
((Music) High-pitched humming:
Silence Is Golden)

561
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.500
Oh. shut up.

562
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.000
(Cheering)

563
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.500
(Press) Mr President!

564
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.000
- Over here. sir!
- What will you be talking about?

565
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.100
Mr President. welcome.

566
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.800
It's a pleasure to meet you.

567
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.700
Come through.
I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

568
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.000
So is she. Although she would have been
kind of Ionely.

569
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.100
Yes. Pathetic. isn't it?

570
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.700
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

571
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.400
Not sure that politics and dating go together.

572
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.400
Really? I've never found that.

573
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.900
Yeah. you're still sickeningly handsome.
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

574
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.600
- Very jealous of your plane. by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

575
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.000
Ah. Natalie. Hi.

576
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.800
Morning. ma'am. How's your day so far?

577
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.500
- (Natalie giggles)
- Excellent.

578
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.000
(Sighs) My goodness.
that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

579
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.100
Did you see those pipes?

580
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.300
Yeah. she's terrific. At her job.

581
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.000
No. absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

582
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.100
That is unexpected.

583
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.600
Well. it shouldn't be.

584
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.800
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

585
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.900
We're being consistent with their policies.

586
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.800
With all respect. they were bad policies.

587
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.000
Thanks. Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

588
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.900
Let's. erm... move on. shall we?

589
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.900
Well. now. that was an interesting day.

590
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.500
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today.

591
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.400
then just disappointing you for four years.

592
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.400
I have plans and I plan to see them through.

593
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.500
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.

594
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.800
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

595
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.500
I'll give you anything you ask for.

596
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.600
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

597
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.100
Hi.

598
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.200
Pathetic.

599
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.400
It's great Scotch.

600
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.300
I'II. erm... I'll be going. then.

601
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.200
Er. Natalie.

602
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.100
I hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

603
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.800
Thank you. sir.

604
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.000
Er. yes. Peter.

605
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.300
Mr President. has it been a good visit?

606
00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.900
Very satisfactory indeed.

607
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.700
We got what we came for

608
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.200
and our special relationship
is still very special.

609
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.800
Prime Minister?

610
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.300
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins. doesn't it?

611
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.900
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

612
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:23.200
A relationship based on
the President taking what he wants

613
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:28.300
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to. erm...

614
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.100
Britain.

615
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.300
We may be a small country
but we're a great one. too.

616
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.600
The country of Shakespeare.
Churchill. the Beatles.

617
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.900
- Sean Connery. Harry Potter.
- (Laughter)

618
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.900
- David Beckham's right foot.
- (Laughter)

619
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.600
David Beckham's left foot. come to that.

620
00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.800
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

621
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.000
And since bullies only respond to strength.
from now onward.

622
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.900
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

623
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.100
And the President
should be prepared for that.

624
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.100
(Press clamouring)

625
00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.200
Mr President!

626
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.500
Joe.

627
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.800
It's your sister on line four.

628
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.700
All right. Er. yes. I'm very busy
and important. how can I help you?

629
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.900
Have you gone completely insane?

630
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.700
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

631
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.600
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

632
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.400
- 'I'll call you back.'
- No. you won't!

633
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.100
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

634
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.300
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

635
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.900
What did I do?
I made a papier-m�ch� lobster head.

636
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.700
What is this we're listening to?

637
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.000
Joni Mitchell.

638
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.900
I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

639
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.500
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

640
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.900
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

641
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.200
Did she? Oh. well. that's good.
I must write to her and say thanks.

642
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.900
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

643
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.100
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

644
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.800
(Female DJ) 'It's almost enough
to make you feel patriotic.

645
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.600
'so here's one
for our arse-kicking prime minister.

646
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.300
'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.'

647
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.900
((Music) Pointer Sisters: Jump)

648
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.700

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:58.900

my kisses in the night then

663
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.000
- (Music stops)
- Yeah. erm.

664
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:36.100
Mary. can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

665
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.700
- Certainly. sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

666
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.800
Erm. Would you like the last. er?

667
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.200
(Portuguese) Thank you very much but no.

668
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.400
If you saw my sister. you'd understand why.

669
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.600
That's all right. more for me.

670
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.900
(Portuguese)
Just don't go eating it all yourself.

671
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.500
you're getting chubbier every day.

672
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.900
I'm very lucky I've got a constitution
where I never put on weight.

673
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.200
(Phone)

674
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.900
- Hello.
- (Ringing continues)

675
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.200
Oop. Sorry.

676
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.400
(Ringing continues)

677
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.300
Hello?

678
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.700
- Thank you.
- (Portuguese) Nao!

679
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.000
- Eu peco imensa desculpa.
- Oh. no. Hold on.

680
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.700
- God. it's half the book. Oh. no.
- Que desastre.

681
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.200
Just leave them. please!
They're not important.

682
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.000
They're not worth it!

683
00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.000
Stop! Stop.

684
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.700
Aa-ahh.

685
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.100
It's all just rubbish.

686
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.900
Just leave it.

687
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.000
Oh. God. she's in.

688
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.800
And now she'll think I'm a total spaz
if I don't go in too.

689
00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.400
(Portuguese) Fuck - it's cold!

690
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.200
Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

691
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.600
(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.

692
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.200
It's not worth it.
this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

693
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.100
(Portuguese) I don't want to drown

694
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.900
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

695
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.500
Just stop. Stop.

696
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.300
(Portuguese) What kind of idiot
doesn't make copies?

697
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.200
I really must do copies.

698
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.800
There'd better not be eels in here.

699
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.900
(Portuguese) Try not to disturb the eels.

700
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.100
Oh. what the hell is that?

701
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.600
Thank you. Thank you so much.

702
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.400
I know. I'll name
one of the characters after you.

703
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.000
(Portuguese) Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

704
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.300
Or give me 50% of the profits.

705
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.500
Or I could give you 5% of the profits.

706
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.300
(Portuguese) What kind of book is it?

707
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.300
- Romance?
- Yes.

708
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.300
It's. erm...
(Imitates horror film sound effects)

709
00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.600
Ah. er...

710
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.900
(Portuguese) Thriller... crime...

711
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.900
(Portuguese) Sim.
(English) Crime. Crime. murder.

712
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.700
(Portuguese) Frightening? (Gasps)

713
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.800
Er. scary? Yes. sometimes scary.

714
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.300
And. er. sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

715
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.100
Mm.

716
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.800
(Portuguese) I'd better get back to work.

717
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:33.500
- Ah.
- (Portuguese) Later you'll drive me home?

718
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.800
Sure.

719
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.000
It's my favourite time of day...

720
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.100
driving you.

721
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:50.900
(Portuguese) It's the saddest part
of my day. leaving you.

722
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.500
Sorry.

723
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.200
(TV) 'And coming up
later this morning. it's this guy... '

724
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.700
(Music) There's no beginning. there'll be no end

725
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.500
- (Music) Cos on Christmas...
- '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll.

726
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.200
'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'

727
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.100
Banoffee pie?

728
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.000
No. thanks.

729
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.400
Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

730
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.000
Right. well. lucky you.

731
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.900
- Can I come in?
- Er. yeah. well. I'm a bit busy...

732
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:05.800
I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

733
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.900
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

734
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.300
or maybe Munchies?

735
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.600
Actually. I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

736
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.700
Mark. can I say something?

737
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.900
Yeah.

738
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.400
I know you're Peter's best friend

739
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.500
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

740
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.700
Look. don't. don't argue.

741
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.100
We've never got friendly.

742
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.700
But I wanted to say. I hope that can change.

743
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.800
I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

744
00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.800
It would be great if we could be friends.

745
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.400
Absolutely. Absolutely.

746
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.500
Great.

747
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.500
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video. though.

748
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.400
I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

749
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.500
This one says
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

750
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.800
Do you think we might be on the right track?

751
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.400
Er. yeah. well... Wow. That-that could be it.

752
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.300
- Do you mind if I?
- I've probably taped over it.

753
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.400
Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

754
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.600
Oh.

755
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.300
Oh. bingo.

756
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.100
That's lovely.

757
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.200
Well done. you.

758
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.900
Oh. that's gorgeous.

759
00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.300
Thank you so much. Mark.
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

760
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.700
I look quite pretty.

761
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.100
You've stayed rather close.

762
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.500
They're all of me.

763
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.600
(Mark) Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.800
Yes.

765
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.000
But...

766
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.300
you never talk to me.

767
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.700
You always talk to Peter.

768
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.500
You don't like me.

769
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.700
I hope it's useful.

770
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.900
Don't show it around too much.

771
00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.200
Needs a bit of editing.

772
00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.900
Look. I've got to get to a... lunch.

773
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.900
Early lunch.

774
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.900
You can just show yourself out. can't you?

775
00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:16.900
It's a... self-preservation thing. you see.

776
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.100
((Music) Dido: Here With Me)

777
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.200
(Music) Oh I am what I am

778
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.200
(Music) I'll do what I want

779
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:39.100
(Music) But I can't hide

780
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.400
(Music) And I won't go

781
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.100
(Music) I won't sleep

782
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.000
(Music) And I can't breathe

783
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.100
(Music) Until you're resting here with me

784
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.900
(Music) And I won't leave

785
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.700
(Music) And I can't hide

786
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.600
(Music) I cannot be

787
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.200
(Music) Until you're resting here

788
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.100
(Music) And I won't go

789
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.000
(Music) And I won't sleep

790
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.000
(Music) And I can't breathe

791
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:15.500
(Music) Until you're resting here with me (Music)

792
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.500
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

793
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.800
Annie. my darling. my dream. my boat.

794
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.000
Ah...

795
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.600
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.

796
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.800
Anything for the hero of the hour.

797
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.600
Don't ask me why.
and don't read stuff into this.

798
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.100
it's just a weird personality thing.

799
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.200
But. erm. you know Natalie who works here?

800
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.900
The chubby girl?

801
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Ooh. would we call her chubby?

802
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.500
I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there.
yes. sir. Huge thighs.

803
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.800
Yeah. Well. whatever. erm...

804
00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.800
I'm sure she's a lovely girl
but I wonder if you could. erm...

805
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.400
redistribute her?

806
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.500
It's done.

807
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.700
Hey. Sammo. Can't sleep?

808
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.600
I got some terrible news today.

809
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.600
Let's have it.

810
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.700
- Joanna's going back to America.
- Your girl's American?

811
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.300
Yes. she's American.

812
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.800
And she's not my girl.

813
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:02.900
And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

814
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.200
That is bad news.

815
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:09.700
Well. we need Kate

816
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.100
and we need Leo. and we need them now.

817
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.100
Come on.

818
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.900
'Hold on. Hold on.

819
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.200
'Keep your eyes closed.

820
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.700
- 'Do you trust me? '
- 'I trust you.'

821
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.300
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

822
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.900
- Fool!
- Get off. you big bully.

823
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.600
'AII right. open your eyes.'

824
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.300
You know. Sammy.
I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary

825
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.400
but general wisdom is that in the end.

826
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.900
there isn't just one person for each of us.

827
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.100
There was for Kate and Leo.

828
00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.800
There was for you.

829
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.800
And there is for me.

830
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.800
She's the one.

831
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.400
Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

832
01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.600
Yeah. I know. Same as Mum.

833
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.400
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

834
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.300
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

835
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.400
(Pidgin Portuguese)
Oh. Appolo... Erm. appologia.

836
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.500
Grande. er... grande familio.
grande tradizione de Christmas presents.

837
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800
Stupido.

838
01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.500
Well. goodbye.

839
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.800
(Portuguese) Thank you.

840
01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.300
Erm. it was. erm...

841
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.400
(Portuguese) I will miss you.

842
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.600
And your very slow typing...

843
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.600

1017
01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.100
I don't know. I hadn't thought.

1018
01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.100
Where's Sarah. by the way?

1019
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.800
She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

1020
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.600
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

1021
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.800
- See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

1022
01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.300
A lot.

1023
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.600
Are you gonna give me something?

1024
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.300
I thought I made it clear last night.

1025
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.000
When it comes to me.
you can have everything.

1026
01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.600
So. erm. what do you need?

1027
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.900
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

1028
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:08.400
No. I don't want something I need.

1029
01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.900
I want something I want. Something pretty.

1030
01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.100
Right.

1031
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.200
Right.

1032
01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:29.300
Sorry I'm late. I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

1033
01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.800
Right. listen. you keep yourself occupied

1034
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

1035
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1036
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.900
Looking for anything in particular. sir?

1037
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.700
Yes. That necklace there. how much is it?

1038
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.900
It's �270.

1039
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.400
- Erm. all right. Er. I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1040
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.500
Would you like it... giftwrapped?

1041
01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.400
- Yes. all right.
- Lovely.

1042
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.700
Let me just pop it in the box.

1043
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.900
There.

1044
01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:38.400
- Look. could we be quite quick?
- Certainly. sir.

1045
01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.400
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1046
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.600
- There.
- That's great.

1047
01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:53.400
Not quite finished.

1048
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.500
- I don't need a bag. I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh. this isn't a bag. sir.

1049
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.000
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1050
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Ooh!

1051
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.700
Could we be quite quick. please?

1052
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.500
Prontissimo.

1053
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.600
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick. sir.

1054
01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:58.100
- Actually. I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it. sir.

1055
01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.600
Want to bet?

1056
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.000
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1057
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.800
There we go. Almost finished.

1058
01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.200
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1059
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.500
No. sir. we're going to pop it
in the Christmas box.

1060
01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.200
I don't want a Christmas box.

1061
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.000
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1062
01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.900
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1063
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.600
- All we need now...
- Oh. God.

1064
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.900
...is a sprig of holly.
- No. no. no. no.

1065
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1066
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.700
- Leave it.
- Ooh!

1067
01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:36.700
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1068
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.400
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1069
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.100
after 13 years of
Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

1070
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.300
Actually. I do love this one.

1071
01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.600
((Music) Darlene Love: All Alone On Christmas)

1072
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.800
(Music) I've gotta know

1073
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.900
(Music) Where do the Ionely hearts go... (Music)

1074
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.400
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1075
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.500
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

1076
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.900
You're not actually going ahead
with this stupid plan?

1077
01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.700
I bloody am.

1078
01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:11.100
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1079
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.200
It is chock-a-block full of condoms.

1080
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.700
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect. keep that going.

1081
01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.100
(Clears throat) Look. erm...

1082
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.000
sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...

1083
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.600
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink.
do you? I mean. nothing implied.

1084
01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:34.300
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1085
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.700
Obviously. if you don't want to.
you don't have to. I...

1086
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.500
I'm rambling now. sorry.

1087
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.300
No. That would be lovely.

1088
01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.700
Oh. great.

1089
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.400
Yay!

1090
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
You know. that is really great.

1091
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.600
Normally. I'm really shy. takes me ages
to get the courage up. so thank you.

1092
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.900
(Repetitive drumbeats)

1093
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.400
- Explain again why you're so late.
- Can't a man have any secrets?

1094
01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:11.700
We've been waiting for hours.
it's the first ever preview.

1095
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.900
(Music)... is a thing of the past

1096
01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.400
(Music) Maybe you can bring us all hope this year

1097

(Music) Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared... (Music)

1098

(Karen) It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1099
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.800
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1100
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.600
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1101
01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.700
(Russian) Is this the way to the train station?

1102
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.900
I would like half-pint of churly.

1103
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.800
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1104
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:53.500
(Portuguese) Oh. my God.
I've got a terrible stomachache.

1105
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.900
It must have been the prawns.

1106
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.500
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1107
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.800
(Portuguese) My goodness.
this is a very big fish!

1108
01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:07.000
It tastes delicious!

(Music) Don't leave me alone (Music)

1114
01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:26.500
- You'll come back a broken man.
- Yeah. back broken from too much sex.

1115
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.100
You are on the road to disaster.

1116
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.600
No. I am on shag highway. heading west.

1117
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.200
Farewell. failure.

1118
01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:39.100
America. watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1119
01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.800
(Music) And he's got a big knob (Music)

((Music) Santana Featuring Rob Thomas:

1121
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.100
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1122
01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:59.500
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.

1123
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.300
(On jukebox) (Music) Man. it's a hot one

1124
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.600
(Music) Like seven inches
from the midday sun... (Music)

1125
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.400
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like a Budweiser. please.

1126
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.900
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1127
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.200
Oh. my God.

1128
01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.100
Are you from England?

1129
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.200
- Yes.
- Oh...

1130
01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:26.200
that is so cute.

Hi. I'm Stacey. (Giggles)

1132
01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.100
Jeannie?

1133
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.100
Yeah?

1134
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.900
- This is...
- Colin.

1135
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.700
Frissell.

1136
01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.900
Cute name.

1137
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.700
- Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1138
01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.000
Yep. Basildon.

1139
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.000
- Oh.
- Oh.

1140
01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.900
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
She's crazy about English guys.

1141
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.200
(Stacey) Uh-huh.

1142
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:07.200
- Hey. girls.
- Carol-Anne. come meet Colin.

1143
01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.900
He's from England.

1144
01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:14.100
Well. step aside. ladies. This one's on me.

1145
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.900
- Hey. gorgeous.
- (Gentle growl)

1146
01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800
That is so funny!

1147
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.500
- What do you call that?
- Er. bottle.

1148
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.700
(With English accent) "Bottle."

1149
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800
- What about this?
- Er. straw.

1150
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.800
(Girls) "Straw."

1151
01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.800
- What about this?
- Table.

1152
01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.100
- Table. The same.
- Oh. it's the same.

1153
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.500
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1154
01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.500
I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1155
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.800
Oh. my God. Oh. my God. that is so cute.

1156
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.500
No. no. no. listen. This may be a bit pushy
cos we just met you but...

1157
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.200
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1158
01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1159
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.500
Well. if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1160
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.500
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1161
01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.800
What?

1162
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.400
Well. we're not the richest of girls.
you know.

1163
01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.400
So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1164
01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.900
So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1165
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.200
And on this cold. cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1166
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.200
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1167
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.700
No?

1168
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.300
Which means...

1169
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.500
we would be naked.

1170
01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:41.900
No. no. I think it'd be fine.

1171
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.400
- (Girls) Great.
- Erm...

1172
01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.500
The thing that's gonna make it
more crowded...

1173
01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.800
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1174
01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.700
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1175
01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.000
Don't worry. you're totally gonna like her
cos she is "the sexy one".

1176
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.900
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1177
01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.800
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh. and he's a Christian.

1178
01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.900
(AIl) Cheers.

1179
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.500
(Music) If I could

1180
01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.700
(Music) Then I would

1181
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:15.900

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.200
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1187
01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.300
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1188
01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.500
- I'll get it.
- No. no. no. I want to choose mine.

1189
01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.800
I think I want...

1190
01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.700
...this one.

1191

1195
01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.300
I'm going to... All right. I'll rip it.

1196
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.300
God. that's a surprise.

1197
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.300
(Daisy) What is it?

1198
01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.900
It's a CD. Joni Mitchell. wow.

1199
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.300
To continue your emotional education.

1200
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.600
Yes.

1201
01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.100
Goodness.

1202
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.100
That's great.

1203
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.100
- My brilliant wife.
- Ah. yes.

1204
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:34.600
Actually. do you mind if I just absent myself
for a second?

1205
01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.700
All that ice cream. Er...

1206
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.000
Darling. could you make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1207

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:58.800
(Music) The dizzy dancing way that you feel

1212
01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:04.000
(Music) As every fairy tale comes real

1213
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.900
(Music) I've looked at love that way

1214
01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.300
(Music) But now it's just another show

1215
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:23.000
(Music) And you leave 'em laughing when you go

1216
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.100
(Music) And if you care

1217
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.500
(Music) Don't let them know

1218
01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.400
(Music) Don't give yourself away

1219
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.600
(Music) I've looked at love

1220
01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.600
(Music) From both sides now

1221
01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.800
(Music) From give and take

1222
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.100
(Music) And still somehow

1223
01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:54.400
(Music) It's love's illusions that I recall

1224
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.800
(Music) I really don't know love

1225
01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.800
(Music) I really don't know love at all

1226

(Music) Tears and fears

1227
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.700
(Music) And feeling proud

1228
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.800

(Music) Oh but now old friends... (Music)

1233
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.400
Oh. my God.

1234
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.500
It's a miracle. You're all dressed.

Come on. come on. come on.
we're horribly late.

1236

(Music) In living every day (Music)

1240
01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.200
- Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

1241
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.800
But the thing about romance is people
only get together right at the very end.

1242
01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:15.200
Of course.

1243
01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:20.000
By the way. I feel bad. I never ask you
how your love life is going.

1244
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.200
Er-huh!

1245
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.100
No.

1246
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.000
As you know.
that was a done deal long ago.

1247
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:33.200
Unless Claudia Schiffer calls. in which case
I want you out of here straightaway.

01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:53.300
Enough.

1354
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.300
Enough now.

1355
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.400
(Sound turned down)

1356
01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.700
(Doorbell)

1357
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:07.300
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at Elton John's.

1358
01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.600
Well. I was there for a minute or two
and then I had an epiphany.

1359
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

1360
01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.300
Come on. Just come up.

1361
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.500
So what was this epiphany?

1362
01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.300
Erm. it... it was about Christmas.

1363
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.700
You realised it was all around.

1364
01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:30.100
No. I realised that Christmas is the time
to be with the people you love.

1365
01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.800
Right.

1366
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.500
And I realised that. as dire chance
and fateful cockup would have it.

1367
01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.700
here I am.

1368
01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.100
mid-fifties.

1369
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:47.300
and without knowing it.
I've spent most of my adult life

1370
01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:51.200
with a chubby employee. (Snorts)

1371
01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.000
And. much as it grieves me to say it.

1372
01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.700
it might be that the people I love is. in fact...

1373
01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.900
you.

1374
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.200
Well. this is a surprise.

1375
01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.000
Yeah.

1376
01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.300
Ten minutes at Elton John's and you're gay?

1377
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.400
No. look. I'm serious here.

1378
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.200
I left Elton's and a hefty number
of half-naked chicks with their mouths open

1379
01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.700
in order to hang out with you at Christmas.

1380
01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.600
- Well. Bill...
- It's a terrible. terrible mistake. chubs...

1381
01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:37.900
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1382
01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:45.300
And to be honest.
despite all my complaining...

1383
01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.700
we have had a wonderful life.

1384
01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.900
Well...

1385
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.900
thank you.

1386
01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.600
I mean. come on. it's been an honour.

1387
01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.500
I feel very proud.

1388
01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.700
Oh. look. don't be a moron.

1389
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.600
(Clears throat)

1390
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:25.000
Come on. let's get pissed and watch porn.

1391
01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.000
(Natalie) 'Dear sir. Dear David.

1392
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:50.400

a very happy New Year.

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.100
'I'm very sorry
about the thing that happened.

1394
01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:56.300
'It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.

1395
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.200
'Particularly because -

1396
01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.100
'if you can't say it at Christmas.
when can you. eh? -

1397
01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.800
'I'm actually yours. With love. your Natalie.'

1398
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.100
Jack. yeah. I need a car.

1399
01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:29.200

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:43.100
Oh. don't wait up.

1402
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.300
I'd like to go to Wandsworth. the dodgy end.

1403
01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.600

(David) Oh. God. it's the longest street
in the world and I have absolutely no idea.

1409
01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:13.000

Aren't you the Prime Minister?

1416
01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:33.900
- Er. yes. In fact. I am. Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

1417

everyone by New Year's Eve.

- No. she doesn't.
- Oh dear. OK.

1421
01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.500
- Are you singing carols?
- Er. no. No. I'm not.

1422
01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.800
- Please. sir. please.
- Please.

1423
01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.600
Well. I suppose I could.

1424

She lives next door.

1434

Ah. Brilliant.

1435
01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.800
You're not who I think you are. are you?

1436
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.100
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1437
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.500
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

- Ah. Hello.

1441
01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.800
Is. er. Natalie in?

1442
01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.600
Oh. where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1443
01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:17.900
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1444
01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:23.000
Erm. this is my mum and my dad
and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1445
01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.200
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1446
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.000
And. erm... this is the Prime Minister.

1447
01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:31.900
Yes. we can see that. darling.

1448
01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.900
And erm. unfortunately. we're very late.

1449
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It's the school Christmas concert.
you see. David.

1450
01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.500
All the local schools have joined together.
even St Basil's...

1451
01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:45.300
- Too much detail. Mum.
- Anyway. how can we help. sir?

1452
01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.300
Well. I... just needed Natalie...

1453
01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300
on some state business.

1454
01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.900
- Oh.
- Right. yes. Of course.

1455
01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.800
Right. er...

1456
01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:03.500
Well. perhaps you should
come on later. Plumpy.

1457
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.000
Er. Natalie.

1458
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:07.600
I don't want to make you late for the concert.

1459
01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:11.200
- No. it's nothing. really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1460
01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.500
- No. really. it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1461
01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.600
Eight is a lot of legs. David.

1462
01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:20.200
Mm. Erm...

1463
01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:24.100
Listen. why don't I give you a lift

1464
01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:29.200
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car.

1465
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.400
OK.

1466
01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:35.200
- Lovely. yes.
- Thank you.

1467
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
Hold tight. everybody.

1468
01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.900
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1469
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.600
Ah. right. Well. er...

1470
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.800
I just wanted to say...

1471
01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.900
thank you for the Christmas card.

1472
01:46:58.100 --> 01:46:59.800
You're welcome.

1473
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.800
Look. I'm so sorry about that day.

1474
01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:05.100
I came in and he slinked towards me
and there was a fire

1475
01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:09.600
and he's the President of the United States
and nothing happened. I promise.

1476
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.900
I just felt like such a fool because...

1477
01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:16.200
I think about you all the time. actually.

1478
01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.600
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1479
01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.500
...Iove.
- Oh. wow.

1480
01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:24.100
That really was just round the corner. Er...

1481
01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:27.900
Erm...

1482
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.600
Ow!

1483
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.100
(Sighs)

1484
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.500
Well. look. I...

1485
01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.700
I think I'd better not come in. you know?

1486
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.300
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1487
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.900
No. please come. It'll be great.

1488
01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:56.700
No. I'd... I'd better not.

1489
01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:02.500
But I will be very sorry

1490
01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:04.800
to drive away from you.

1491
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.500
Just give me one second.

1492
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:25.500
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1493
01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.700
- Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1494
01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:33.900
No!

1495
01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:08.900
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1496
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.100
OK. Terry. I won't be long.

1497
01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:17.500
Look. this has to be a very secret visit. OK?

1498
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.700
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1499
01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:27.700
Look. the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1500
01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.700
- Oh. David.
- Ah!

1501
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.200
Oh. how are you?

1502
01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.300
Hi. guys. Hey. hey. hey. You all right?

1503
01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.500
What the hell are you doing here?

1504
01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:43.500
- Well. you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1505
01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:48.300
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1506
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.400
I thought it was time I did.

1507
01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.700
I didn't want anyone to see.
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1508
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.300
Good luck. Daisy. good luck. Bernie.

1509
01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:00.100
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1510
01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:03.400
- Thank you.
- All right.

1511
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:06.500
Oh. now. We haven't been introduced.

1512
01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.600
Right. Well. this is Gavin.

1513
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.800
- Hello. Gavin.
- My copper.

1514
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And this is Natalie. who's my. erm...

1515
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.900
- who's my. erm. catering manager.
- Oh.

1516
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
- Hi.
- Catering manager.

1517
01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.200
Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1518
01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.400
20 years ago. you'd have been his type.

1519
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.300
I'll be very careful. Don't try something. sir.

Right.

1581
01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.900
So. not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

1582
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.200
- What do we do now?
- Smile.

1583
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.300
Little bow.

1584
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:37.900
And a wave.

1585
01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.500
Absolutely no idea.
I mean. can you imagine?

1586
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.600
I'll see you later. all right?

1587
01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.800
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1588
01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.400
Tell me. if you were in my position.
what would you do?

1589
01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.500
What position is that?

1590
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.300
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1591
01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:14.500
and. come Christmas.
gave it to somebody else.

1592
01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.300
- Oh. Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1593
01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:20.000
- Good night.
- Night. darling. Happy Christmas.

1594
01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:23.000
Would you wait around to find out
if it's just a necklace

1595
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:25.600
or if it's sex and a necklace

1596
01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:29.300
or if. worst of all. it's a necklace and love?

1597
01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:35.600
Would you stay? Knowing life
would always be a little bit worse?

1598
01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.300
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh. God.

1599
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.700
I am so in the wrong.

1600
01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.800
A classic fool.

1601
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Yes. but you've also made a fool out of me.

1602
01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.900
You've made the life I lead foolish. too.

1603
01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.400
Darling. Ooh. darlings!

1604
01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:03.600
Oh. you were wonderful.

1605
01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.700
My little lobster. you were so...

1606
01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.000
What is that word?

1607
01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.300
Orange.

1608
01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:14.500
Come on. I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1609
01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:20.600
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming. son.

1610
01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:24.800
- Thanks. Plan didn't work. though.
- Tell her. then.

1611
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.800
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1612
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.800
No way. Anyway. they fly tonight.

1613
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.100
Even better. Sam. you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1614
01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:39.100
I never told your mum enough.

1615
01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.500
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1616
01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.900
You've seen the films. kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1617
01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:55.600
OK. Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1618
01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:58.100
Yes.

1619
01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:00.500
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1620
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.800
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1621
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
That's OK.

1622
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.500
- My fault.
- No. no. really. it wasn't.

1623
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:13.600
You're Sam's dad. aren't you?

1624
01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:16.500
Yeah. Stepdad. actually.

1625
01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:19.400
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1626
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.200
Carol.

1627
01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.600
- OK. I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1628
01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.300
I hope we'll meet again. Karen.

1629
01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.600
Carol. (Laughs)

1630
01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:37.600
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1631
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.300
(Carol laughs)

1632
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.600
- Tell her.
- What?

1633
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:50.600
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1634
01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:56.400
- Look. there she is.
- Where?

1635
01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.700
Over there.

1636
01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.600
Oh. no.

1637
01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.700
It's OK. we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1638
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.100
(Portuguese) Good evening.

1639
01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:27.100
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1640
01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:30.800
I am here to ask your daughter

1641
01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:32.900
for her hands in marriage.

1642
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.100
You want to marry my daughter?

1643
01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:37.100
Yes.

1644
01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:38.700
Come here.

1645
01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.300
there is a man at the door.

1646
01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:44.000
He wants to marry you.

1647
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.500
But I've never seen him before.

1648
01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:46.900
Who cares?

1649
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.200
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1650
01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:52.200
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1651
01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:56.900
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1652
01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:00.800
She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.

1653
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.500
You! Stay here.

1654
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.300
As if I would. Stupid!

1655
01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.000
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1656
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Wait. Wait.

1657
01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:23.800
Oh. no.

1658
01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:27.200
You better not say yes. Father.

1659
01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:30.200
Shut up. Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1660
01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.900
- Look. we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1661
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:43.300
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1662
01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.100
No.

1663
01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:52.400
- I'm sorry. Sam.
- Boarding pass. sir?

1664
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:56.000
Just a moment. I know I've got it.
Would you hang on to that?

1665
01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.100
- Unless...
- What?

1666
01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.700
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1667
02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:03.300
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1668
02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:07.000
- OK.
- Yes!

1669
02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:11.400
I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1670
02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:31.400
(Beeping)

1671
02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.900
(Inaudible through glass)

1672
02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:19.500
(Chattering excitedly)

1673
02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.900
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1674
02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.200
Cool!

1675
02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.500
Joanna.

1676
02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:08.600
Sam?

1677
02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:16.100
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1678
02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:19.800
Oh. Jesus. Here. I've gotta run.

1679
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:15.000
- (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1680
02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.100
This man wants to marry her.

1681
02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:19.900
He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1682
02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:40.700
Boa noite. Aurelia.

1683
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:44.200
Boa noite. Jamie.

1684
02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.500
Beautiful Aurelia...

1685
02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:06.700
I've come here with a view to asking you...

1686
02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:10.000
to marriage me.

1687
02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:16.100
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1688
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.700
