﻿1
00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:55.708
Captain!

2
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:02.833
Captain!

3
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.500
Can we talk?

4
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:14.583
We must break through the ice.

5
00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.083
The men are hungry and exhausted.

6
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.625
We cannot keep up this pace
without consequence…

7
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.583
Listen up. men!

8
00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:32.708
The more we delay the labor. the firmer
the grasp of the ice will become.

9
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.750
The work continues.

10
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:36.708
Rotate each group.

11
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:37.958
Sir. with respect…

12
00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:39.916
The men need assurances.

13
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.958
Assurances?

14
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.791
Yes. that we will head back
to St. Petersburg once we free the ship.

15
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.583
They don't think we'll be seaworthy
for long and they want to know--

16
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.083
Listen up!

17
00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:55.875
It is neither your place-
nor the officer here- to think anything…

18
00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.125
We signed up for a mission and
we will see it to completion.

19
00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.750
We will reach the North Pole.

20
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.458
Is it understood?

21
00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.333
An explosion. Captain--

22
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.083
About two miles away.

23
00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.083
Get the men.

24
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.916
The sled dogs are unharmed.

25
00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:15.125
Then- Where does all this blood come from?

26
00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:16.625
Over here. Captain!

27
00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:20.458
A wounded man-- he's lost a lot of blood.

28
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.916
Wound to the shoulder-- his leg is broken.

29
00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.208
Bear attack?

30
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.875
I don't think so. Captain.

31
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.708
Larsen. help me with his boot.

32
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:43.958
A prosthetic leg.

33
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.333
Put him on the board.

34
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.458
Hurry-- To the ship-- Now!

35
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.625
Larsen. that thing is coming.

36
00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:09.541
Ready the rifles!

37
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:15.958
On my command.

38
00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:21.708
Aim!

39
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:24.166
Fire!

40
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:36.916
Next group!

41
00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.500
Fire!

42
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.458
All to the ship!

43
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.041
Where is that man we brought onboard?

44
00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:19.958
Where?

45
00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.583
What is that thing? What does it want?

46
00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:50.750
The Blunderbuss.
Larsen. get the Blunderbuss!

47
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.875
I killed it.

48
00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:22.500
I killed it.

49
00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.000
It's still alive!

50
00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:38.208
Ladder!

51
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:39.625
Pull up the ladder!

52
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.541
How many shots are left?

53
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.083
One. but it can't kill it.

54
00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.708
I know.

55
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:23.875
I'm not aiming for him.

56
00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.833
Come down. your father is arriving.

57
00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.375
I'm here. Mother.

58
00:10:33.916 --> 00:10:35.125
I'm here.

59
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.083
Three…

60
00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:04.416
Two…

61
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.375
One…

62
00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.708
That's impossible.

63
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:29.458
It's Mother.

64
00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:16.000
Help him.

65
00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:17.583
Help him!

66
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:44.416
You better come with me.

67
00:36:45.875 --> 00:36:47.208
Nothing.

68
00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:48.916
Sir- the watchman saw him.

69
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:51.458
Circling the ship. In the mist.

70
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:53.166
We all saw him drown.

71
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.416
Sir.

72
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.000
The men are terrified.

73
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:58.458
They think that man should be
surrendered to the ice

74
00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.708
and be done with this.

75
00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:04.000
He is under my protection…

76
00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:08.083
and the protection of the Crown!

77
02:18:47.375 --> 02:18:48.291
Weapons down.

78
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.041
-Put the weapons down.
-I am responsible for my men.

79
02:18:52.458 --> 02:18:53.708
He can leave.

80
02:20:28.583 --> 02:20:29.666
We are free!

81
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:31.000
We are free!

82
02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:33.791
Captain…

83
02:20:34.791 --> 02:20:36.166
What are your orders?

84
02:20:36.250 --> 02:20:37.250
Man the sails.

85
02:20:37.833 --> 02:20:38.708
Turn around.

86
02:20:38.791 --> 02:20:40.083
Do you want to tell the men?

87
02:20:40.708 --> 02:20:41.541
Men!

88
02:20:42.958 --> 02:20:44.125
We're sailing home.

89
02:20:44.833 --> 02:20:45.916
We're sailing home.
