- [shouts] <i>Salud!</i>

167
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:35.020
<i>But Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.</i>

168
00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:39.862
<i>Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha.</i>

169
00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:43.733
<i>nicknamed "The Mexican."
for his love of tequila and sombreros.</i>

170
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.601

174

- [people screaming]

175
00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.253
[in Spanish]
Hey. partner. What are you doing here?

176
00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:09.086
[Steve]
<i>And sometimes. your partners.</i>

177
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.928
<i>Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.</i>

178
00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:26.571
<i>So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.</i>

179

[in Spanish]

180
00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:33.646
[Steve]
<i>Yeah. you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.</i>

181

<i>Cigarettes. alcohol. marijuana.
you name it.</i>

184
00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:48.735
<i>At the time.
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.</i>

185
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:53.301
<i>But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.</i>

186
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.601
<i>They didn't play by the same rules.</i>

187
00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.497
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
Good day.

188
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.509
Pablo Escobar?

189
00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:03.014
Where's Felipo?

190
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.149
Felipo's been arrested.

191
00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.015
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

192
00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:10.199
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

193
00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:12.624
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

194
00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.819
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax. Gustavo. please.

195
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.486
Show some respect.

196
00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:20.929
Now what's the problem.
Mr. Jose Luis?

197
00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:24.996
How do you know my name?

198
00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:27.264
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

199
00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:31.973
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

200
00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:39.008
There's Garcia. Lopez...

201
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.144
- Is that Pinilla?
- [Gustavo] Yes. Pinilla.

202
00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:42.347
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

203
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.956
Pinilla...

204
00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.855
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

205
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.018
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

206
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.652
I don't have all day.

207
00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.467
Open it.

[Herrera chuckles]

209
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.504
Tell me something. Mr. Escobar.

210
00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:09.309
Who the fuck do you think you are?

211
00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:12.817
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

212
00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.683
Because I pay for the privilege. Colonel.

213
00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.483
Oh. yeah? You don't say.

214
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.353
Where are your import papers?

215
00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:21.691
You need papers for these TV sets.

216
00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.194
Take them.

217
00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:24.829
[chuckles]

218
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:29.995
Sorry. Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

219
00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:32.402
- Look. brother. it's not for you.
- Then who?

220
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.268
It's for Carlitos.

221
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.339
Your son.

222
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.207
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

223
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:44.714
Hey. Pinilla!

224
00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:50.082
Your daughter just
got her driver's license. right?

225
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:56.094
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

226
00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:01.394
That friend of yours. Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

227
00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:04.903
- Right? She's a fox.
- [Gustavo] Yeah.

228
00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.768
Your wife is gorgeous. brother.

229
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.732
What's she doing with a guy like you?

230
00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.580
I think she deserves some jewelry. no?

231
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.790
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

232
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.396
Colonel. how is your mom doing?

233
00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:33.625
- She just got out of the hospital. right?
- Yes. she's feeling better.

234
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.895
- Good. That makes us happy. right?
- [Gustavo] Yes.

235
00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:39.434
Gentlemen...

236
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.668
I'm going to tell you who I am.

237
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.072
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

238
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:50.446
My eyes are everywhere.

239
00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:54.484
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

240
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.740
without me knowing about it.

241
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.823
Do you understand? Not a finger.

242
00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:05.665
One day. I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

243
00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:10.795
So look. I make deals for a living.

244
00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:14.431
Now. you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

245
00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.775
or accept the consequences.

246
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.779
Silver...

247
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.982
or lead.

248
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.011
You decide.

249
00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.622
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.

257
00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:36.923
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

258
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.388
Explain.

259
00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:41.518
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

260
00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.619
I will handle
the chemical part of production.

261
00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:46.308
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

262
00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:48.733
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

263
00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:52.200
- Now tell him how much it costs.
- [chuckles]

264
00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:56.239
In Chile. this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

265
00:17:56.475 --> 00:18:00.071
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes. it's very good. Look...

266
00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:05.379
You do a little bit. and in 20 minutes.
you want to do some more.

267
00:18:05.618 --> 00:18:06.950
Also...

268
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.389
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

269
00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:12.981
It's very clean. this stuff.
Want some?

270
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.726
If this is really that good
and we can make some money.

271
00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.807
- we can find room on our trucks.
- [Cockroach sniffs]

272
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.266
We can sell it in Bogotá. Barranquilla.
Cali. Cartagena...

273
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.731
We're going to be rich.

274

- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

275

Well look. Cuca...

you don't have any vision.
my friend.

277
00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.010
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

278
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.282
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

wanna be there. you don't have to be.

333
00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:26.513
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So. I don't know... [indistinct]

334
00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:29.019
[men cackling]

335
00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:32.584
[Steve]
<i>Yeah. those bastards got me.</i>

336
00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.990
<i>But I couldn't let it end like that.</i>

337
00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:37.926
Excuse me. [clears throat]
See those guys over there?

338
00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.494
Uh. they're fucking with me.

339
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:44.035
Telling me you were checking out my ass.
and who checks out a cop's ass. right?

340
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.365
You're a cop?

341
00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:47.803
Not a cop. actually. I'm DEA.

342
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040
Drug Enforcement?

343
00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:51.144
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

344
00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:54.503
Come on. why don't you do me a favor?
[clears throat]

345
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:57.173
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you. uh...

346
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.978
give me your phone number?

347
00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:01.377
How about a fake number?

348
00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.521
That'll work.

349
00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:06.018
Hey. buddy. you got a pen?

350
00:22:09.028 --> 00:22:10.121
[sighs]

351
00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:23.299
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

352
00:22:24.243 --> 00:22:25.802
Have a good night.

353
00:22:28.514 --> 00:22:31.177
- [Kevin] Aah...
- [men laughing]

354
00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.410
[Kevin] Shot down!

355
00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:36.248
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh. I...

356
00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.542
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

357
00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.889
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

358
00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.428
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

359
00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:46.191
How much did that cost you?

360
00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.392
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

361
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:55.030
[dial tone]

362
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.507
- [dialing number]
- [Steve] <i>I figured. what the hell.</i>

363
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.012
<i>Worst that could happen.
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.</i>

364
00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:04.241
[line ringing]

365
00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.580
Hello?

366
00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.556
So it wasn't a fake.

367
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.089
I thought you might figure it out.

368
00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.593
After all. you're DEA.

369
00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:20.063
[Steve]
<i>And just like that... she had me.</i>

370
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.529
<i>The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru.</i>

371
00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:28.403
<i>cocaine had him.</i>

372
00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:32.809
[in Spanish]
It's been a while.

373
00:23:32.945 --> 00:23:35.471
These are my friends.
Pablo and Gustavo.

374
00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.982
Would you like a little coffee?

375
00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:40.711
Yeah. a coffee?

376
00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:41.819
Yes. a coffee.

377
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.041
- How about you. Pablo?
- No.

378
00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.579
[Cockroach]
You sure?

379
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.786
My factory is small.
but highly productive.

380
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:53.764
Look. For crushing the leaves. I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

381
00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:57.493
Little magic leaves.

382
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.338
[man] The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

383
00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:07.413
[Cockroach] Over here. the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

384
00:24:07.513 --> 00:24:12.577
Then you cut it.
and mix it with gasoline.

385
00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:16.645
Then. basically. you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

386
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:18.587
Let it dry. dry. dry.

387
00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:20.421
[man]
You use ammonia to get the paste.

388
00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:26.022
[Cockroach] And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

389
00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.361
Here is the prize.

390
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.867
It's like the kitchen in your house.

391
00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:34.966
Like baking a cake.
[clears throat]

392
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:38.970
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

393
00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:41.047
[chuckling]

394
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.274
Look. an old press. an antique.

395
00:24:47.753 --> 00:24:50.848
Now we put it in the oven.

396
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.550
Here's one.
The other will follow.

397
00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:56.719
All natural. organic and healthy.
Very good.

398
00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:58.995
[Gustavo] Well...

399
00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:03.536
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

400
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:06.833
- No.
- [man] You said a kilo.

401
00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.339
We'll take five.

402
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.343
[softly]
How do we get five across the border?

403
00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:14.310
That's Gustavo's department.

404
00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:22.020
[man]
This one has got a good engine.

405
00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:24.833
I was taking a look at it.
and the best place to hide the merchandise

406
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.019
would be under the rear wheel well.

407
00:25:27.126 --> 00:25:29.220
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

408
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.659
Is this easy to take off?

409
00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:33.426
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

410
00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:35.898
All right. all right.
I'll take three cars. please.

411
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.937
- Sure. when do you need them?
- Now. brother.

412
00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:42.606
All right. we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

413
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.869
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

414
00:25:44.977 --> 00:25:50.109
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

415
00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:52.527
- For three cars. that's 60 kilos.
- [Pablo counting softly]

416
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.851
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram. what?

417
00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:57.445
$9.000 per kilo.

418
00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:00.081
$9.000 times 60...
The profit is $540.000.

419
00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.387
- [laughing]
- That's it!

420
00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.294
- Do you know how to drive. Cockroach?
- Yeah.

421
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.110
- OK. Pablo and I drive fast.
- [chuckling]

422
00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:10.063
[Steve]
<i>That's half a million dollars... per trip.</i>

423
00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:13.264
<i>using the same smuggling routes
he always used.</i>

424
00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:17.872
<i>Easiest money he ever made.</i>

425
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:26.116
<i>Back in Medellín.
Pablo didn't waste any time.</i>

426
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.879
<i>He bought a house
in his old neighborhood</i>

427
00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:32.981
<i>and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.</i>

428
00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:35.824
[in Spanish]
How are you feeling. Gustavo?

429
00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:39.431
All this smells like shit to me.

430
00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:43.059
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

431
00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:45.467
The stinkier. the better.

432
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:47.400
All right.

433
00:26:48.474 --> 00:26:50.238
What about all these lights?

434
00:26:51.844 --> 00:26:54.313
Is that to tip off the cops.
or what?

435
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:58.747
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

436
00:26:58.851 --> 00:27:01.753
I'm the artist here. clear?

437
00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:03.015
Clear.

438
00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:05.147
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

439
00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:09.624
[Steve] <i>It was a mom-and-pop operation.</i>
<i>so small they called it The Kitchen.</i>

440
00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:13.460
<i>But make no mistake.
it would change Medellín forever.</i>

441
00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:16.000
[in Spanish] You know the thing
that has me worried. Pablo?

442
00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:20.797
[exhales]

443
00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:25.469
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

444
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:30.279
[inhales deeply]

445
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:34.863
[voice strains]
Let's build them a chimney.

446
00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:36.981
- [sputtering]
- [giggles]

447
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.059
- There you go.
- [laughing]

448
00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:45.061
[Gustavo]
Gentlemen. the first three?

449
00:27:45.197 --> 00:27:48.634
If this business makes so much money.
why are you sending me coach?

450
00:27:48.734 --> 00:27:50.814
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

451
00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:54.067
- Don't be a dick.
- No. no. don't give me that dumb shit.

452
00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:57.665
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

453
00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:59.896
[Gustavo] I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

454
00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:06.882
[Steve] <i>Like her son. Pablo's mother</i>
<i>Hermilda was very resourceful.</i>

455
00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:11.078
[Pablo speaking Spanish] Hey. Mom.
how much do you think we can fit in there?

456
00:28:11.223 --> 00:28:14.591
- Around five kilos. honey.
- That much?

457
00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.092
Trust me. Pablito.

458
00:28:16.228 --> 00:28:18.163
I love it. Let's do it.

459
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.160
- Pablo.
- Thank you. my love.

460
00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.104
[knocking at door]

461
00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:28.502
It's Gustavo.

462
00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:30.706
Five kilos. right?

463
00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:34.337
[Steve] <i>Pablo loved his young bride Tata.</i>
<i>and she loved him.</i>

464
00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.847
<i>He was a family man till the end.</i>

465
00:28:36.949 --> 00:28:40.078
<i>The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.</i>

466
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:42.017
- Meet my friend.
- Hello. how are you doing?

467
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.213
Hey. Pablo. this is Lion.

468
00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:46.534
[Steve] <i>He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd</i>
<i>spent his childhood in the United States.</i>

469
00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.937
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich. right?

470
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:50.930
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

471
00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:52.554
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you. Lion.

472
00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:53.893
Here's three.

473
00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:56.594
We're going to need two more.
right. Mom?

474
00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.465
- [Hermilda] That's right.
- Pablito...

475
00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:00.971
make sure it is not you
who wears it. OK?

476
00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:04.304
Look. my love...
it won't fit me. [chuckles]

477
00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:06.139
Try it on.

478
00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:07.439
Come here.

479
00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.309
That's it.

480
00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:10.814
Good. right?

481
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:14.418
One...

482
00:29:15.687 --> 00:29:17.781
- two...
- Wow. it holds a lot!

483
00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.323
Three.

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:23.151
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

486
00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:24.923
He looks really handsome.
doesn't he?

487
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.898
[Hermilda] Listen. Lion.
that jacket fits you very nicely.

488
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.562
Yeah. Excuse me. ma'am. can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

489
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.138
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

490
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.298
He looks very handsome. son.

491
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.739

I got it in Colombia and look.
it has a little gift.

509

I was in jail for a while. remember?

510

That's good. because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

551
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:44.593
You two can easily swallow 70

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:47.791
And I'll pay you $15.000

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:53.221

Can you fit more?

586
00:34:53.325 --> 00:34:55.055
We'll leave the engine. right?

587
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:57.829
- How much more?
- [chuckles]

588
00:34:57.963 --> 00:35:00.330
About... 300 more.

What do you think. Pablo?

is like the "egg" business.

- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.867
Be careful. guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time.

629
00:37:17.102 --> 00:37:20.630
the Peruvians will raise the price.

They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

631
00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:28.144

the refining process if we buy together.

Well. guys. the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

You need a lot of creativity for that.

634
00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:41.726
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:45.593
You deliver the product to me. labeled.

636
00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:49.225
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

637
00:37:49.334 --> 00:37:51.894
Better yet. Lehder will do it.

638
00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:55.064
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value.

639
00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:59.634
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

replaced by Colombians.</i>

Two of the pellets split open.

697

[dry chuckle] Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

705
00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:06.617
If it wasn't for me. you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

706

Let me give you a piece of advice.

707
00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:11.953
Never say that to Pablo.

708
00:43:12.857 --> 00:43:15.053

[Steve]

710

We lost it.

Gustavo. what do you mean
"we lost it"?

716

Just what I said. we lost it.

We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

718

Don't mess with me. Pablo.
We lost it.

719
00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:13.614
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

720

Look...

721
00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:22.322

So how did we lose a load. brother?

723

726
00:44:39.944 --> 00:44:41.310
Too much.

727

What are you going to do?

728
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:51.553
Come back. Pablo.

- Eat shit.

Eat. Shit.

737
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:11.763

[Pablo laughs]

Not that low.

[Herrera]
You can go now. officer.

755
00:47:25.543 --> 00:47:27.034
Sit down. Mr. Pablo.

756
00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:36.182
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

757
00:47:38.122 --> 00:47:43.083
That's a street value
of over four million dollars. Mr. Escobar.

758
00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:46.261
And you only gave us $150.000.

759
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:50.391
Well. that's what we agreed upon.

760

You know something?

I make deals for a living.

762

Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

763
00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:08.578
Or we can renegotiate.
come to an agreement.

764
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.211

What is it?

770
00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:37.913
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

771
00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:41.278
Otherwise. how would you know?

772
00:48:45.156 --> 00:48:47.216
Give me a name...

773
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.589

to split the cash with him.

<i>The plan was to trade vehicles.</i>

781
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.792
<i>and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.</i>

as a precious gift to His children.

Say yes to your life.
