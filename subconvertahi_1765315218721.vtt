00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:26.545
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100.000 REWARD

3
00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:43.242
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

4
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.913
You make the mistakes.
and then you preach solidarity?

5
00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.332
- Shut up. fag.
- What the fuck. Carlos?

6
00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.502
Why are you always defending him?

7
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.546
Did he get your sister
back for you or not?

8
00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:59.424
We rescued her
because we did it together. Right?

9
00:05:04.013 --> 00:05:05.389
Gentlemen...

10
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.519
I suggest we form another organization

11
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:14.023
to fight against
this injustice of extradition.

12
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.316
Like John Lennon said.

13
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.862
- "Come together. hermanos y hermanas--"
- Stop that fag shit now.

14
00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.074
So Jorge...

15
00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.201
what will we call it?

16
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.929
Next!

17
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.271
Fire!

18
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.531
The gringos are the ones
who use the drugs.

19
00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:09.411
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

20
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.541
I mean. all of the problems

21
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.921
are because of those imperialist gringos!

22
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.548
No. stay there. Stay there.

23
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.977
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a grave in the United States."

24
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.022
I've got it. Fabio. I've got it.
Let's see...

25
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:41.652
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

26
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.946
- What do you think?
- I love it.

27
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.614
Very good.

28
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:49.118
And for $50.000 more.
we'll make your logo.

29
00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:51.203
Done.

30
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.833
THE EXTRADITABLES

31
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:12.492
If you speak in favor of extradition.
you will be their puppet.

32
00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:14.912
and that will be your death sentence.

33
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:19.124
I don't care about the Americans. but I am
still going to support extradition.

34
00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:22.669
Besides. if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country.

35
00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:24.171
then let them take them.

36
00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:00.249
Defendants. please rise.

37
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.796
You've been convicted of cocaine traffic
in Colombia and indicted in the US.

38
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:12.844
You will immediately be turned over
to the DEA for extradition to America.

39
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.334
- Thank you for seeing me. General.
- You're welcome.

40
00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:53.004
Listen. I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

41
00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:57.468
With all due respect. General Jaramillo.
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

42
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.512
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

43
00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:02.473
Well. I don't want him to follow.

44
00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:05.142
I want him to lead.

45
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.232
Go ahead.

46
00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:15.444
Yes. General.

47
00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.695
As you wish.

48
00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:18.905
Understood.

49
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.119
What happened. honey?

50
00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.996
Things with work.

51
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.290
At what time does Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

52
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:32.043
I'm making the chicken he likes.
but he's out with the girlfriend.

53
00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:37.341
Tell me what's wrong.

54
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.759
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

55
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.684
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

56
00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.688
They are saying that
since you've become a wanted man.

57
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.440
bribing the police
has become very costly.

58
00:12:53.524 --> 00:12:55.567
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

59
00:12:58.654 --> 00:13:02.157
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back. well. then...

60
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.159
I didn't hear them complaining.
did I?

61
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.911
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

62
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.831
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

63
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.752
What I would do better is to increase
the payments to the police. you know?

64
00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.128
And most of all. to the top brass.

65
00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.632
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

66
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.222
Oh. shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

67
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.016
Egrets from the Himalayas.

68
00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.603
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

69
00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.773
They cost me a million dollars.

70
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.031
Bastards.

71
00:13:44.408 --> 00:13:46.744
Stay in the fucking tree!

72
00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.339
Seems like you lost that dough.
eh. cousin?

73
00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.510
The thing is.
that's your problem. Pablo.

74
00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:06.096
You think that everything
can be controlled.

75
00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.682
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

76
00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:12.018
OK. OK. OK. Gustavo. OK.

77
00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.372
Hand me that coffee.

78
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:58.560
But you do know where he is hiding.
don't you?

79
00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.666
Look. little brother...

80
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.003
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

81
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.924
But I will also kill you.

82
00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.092
And very slowly.

83
00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.305
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

84
00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:40.018
Well. then. you should pray we find him.
and quickly.

85
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.242
Boss!

86
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.327
Poison...

87
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.703
Boss!

88
00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:03.000
They were headed for El Bizcocho.
but they got off the main highway.

89
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.794
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

90
00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:07.128
Two hours. boss.

91
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:10.674
Round up the guys.
and tell them to get ready.

92
00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.676
- We're leaving.
- All right.

93
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.764
We have to go.

94
00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.058
Go where?

95
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.852
The police are coming.

96
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.187
- But Pablo. I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry. my love.

97
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.149
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

98
00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:30.109
We'll buy new ones later. won't we?

99
00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.239
I'm sorry.

100
00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.076
Do you hear me complaining?

101
00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:46.125
Whenever you are with us. Pablo.
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

102
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.137
Bring all of the boxes here.

103
00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:02.809
Cangrejo! Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

104
00:19:02.893 --> 00:19:04.061
Efrain!

105
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.730
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

106
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.904
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

107
00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.007
What's wrong. Gustavo?

108
00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.468
You fucked us. Pablo.

109
00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:41.098
Not only you and me.

110
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.807
You fucked the whole family.

111
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.523
But of course. since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

112
00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:55.278
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country.

113
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.697
the rest of us get screwed.
isn't that right?

114
00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:05.371
But what the fuck...

115
00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:09.208
a man only dies once. right?

116
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.504
Come here.

117
00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:21.554
My brother.

118
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.391
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on. come on.

119
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.562
There we go.

120
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.792
These are from
the narcos' account in Miami.

121
00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:42.713
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

122
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.258
Yes.

123
00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:50.388
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

124
00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:51.973
Obviously. it's an alias.

125
00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:55.977
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

126
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.313
He's not Colombian.

127
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:03.901
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

128
00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:05.403
A gringo?

129
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:09.907
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

130
00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:14.537
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

131
00:24:17.123 --> 00:24:19.667
Suarez. do you ever worry
what would happen to you

132
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.046
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

133
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:26.757
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

134
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:30.553
Prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

135
00:24:32.347 --> 00:24:36.351
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

136
00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:40.063
Maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

137
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:48.506
Until next time.

138
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.268
Hi. Vanessa.

139
00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:39.816
There's no way out. Carlitos.
You're going to Disneyland.

140
00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:14.558
Gentlemen?

141
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:17.603
Thank you.

142
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.904
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

143
00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:31.200
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

144
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:34.953
against the legality of extradition.

145
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:39.958
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

146
00:32:40.042 --> 00:32:42.628
Can we buy someone in that court?

147
00:32:43.713 --> 00:32:45.798
Unfortunately. no.

148
00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:49.343
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

149
00:32:50.427 --> 00:32:53.430
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

150
00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:56.308
Brother... even after he's dead.

151
00:32:56.517 --> 00:32:59.770
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

152
00:32:59.854 --> 00:33:01.772
He's totally fucked.

153
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.482
This is gringo bullshit.

154
00:33:03.566 --> 00:33:07.361
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

155
00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.697
We're next. aren't we?

156
00:33:09.906 --> 00:33:11.782
You're right.

157
00:33:11.866 --> 00:33:13.784
Pablito.

158
00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:15.369
Do you have an answer or what?

159
00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:24.545
Well... in my opinion. a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

160
00:33:25.755 --> 00:33:29.258
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

161
00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:31.928
Carlos was one of us.

162
00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:38.809
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

163
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.144
But remember.
they want someone more than they want us.

164
00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:44.356
So. brothers...

165
00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:47.860
it's time to give them what they want.
isn't it?

166
00:33:48.778 --> 00:33:52.322
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

167
00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:55.701
It's not so simple. you know?
It's risky.

168
00:33:55.785 --> 00:33:58.621
It's going to require
more men and weapons.

169
00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:00.163
There will be casualties.

170
00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:05.544
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

171
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.171
Two million US dollars.

172
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.050
It's too dangerous.

173
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:17.014
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice.

174
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:21.936
It goes without saying.
dangerous or not.

175
00:34:32.822 --> 00:34:34.698
For us. brother...

176
00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:39.286
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

177
00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:44.000
We have an historical obligation.

178
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:46.919
We can't ignore it.

179
00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:58.848
Meet Pablo Escobar.

180
00:35:01.642 --> 00:35:02.935
Miss.

181
00:35:03.978 --> 00:35:05.688
- OK.
- We have a deal.

182
00:35:05.771 --> 00:35:07.189
You got it.

183
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:08.858
We were just leaving.

184
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:11.861
Good night.

185
00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:21.495
What the hell is this?

186
00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:23.706
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

187
00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:25.749
We made an agreement.

188
00:35:25.833 --> 00:35:27.501
Obviously about money.

189
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:30.295
In exchange for what?

190
00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:34.925
Unless you are willing to be part of it.
I cannot say.

191
00:35:37.511 --> 00:35:42.016
It's a partnership.
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

192
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:46.478
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

193
00:41:04.713 --> 00:41:08.091
They're looking for us everywhere.

194
00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:10.135
What did you expect?

195
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:12.179
That it would be any different?

196
00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:18.727
You did a very good job.

197
00:41:32.408 --> 00:41:35.994
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

198
00:41:36.203 --> 00:41:39.248
No. brother.
The truth is. you helped mine.

199
00:41:42.418 --> 00:41:43.960
You. Ivan...

200
00:41:45.045 --> 00:41:48.298
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

201
00:41:50.092 --> 00:41:52.844
The same one that freed this country.

202
00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:00.436
Now it belongs to you.

203
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:10.362
With it. you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

204
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:16.534
I promise you. I will continue the fight.

205
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:18.703
You earned it. brother.

206
00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:21.998
As for me...

207
00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:25.335
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

208
00:42:26.378 --> 00:42:27.879
We are also--

209
00:42:32.259 --> 00:42:34.386
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

210
00:42:36.138 --> 00:42:37.764
And the fucking sword.

210
00:42:38.305 --> 00:43:38.914
