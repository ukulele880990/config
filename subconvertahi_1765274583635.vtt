00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:04.912
-I wanted to introduce myself.
-OK.

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.590
<i>The two most talked-about
prospects in the world:</i>

5
00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:10.593
<i>Canada's Shane Hollander
and Russia's Ilya Rozanov.</i>

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.638
<i>Always. uh.
Hollander and Rozanov. right?</i>

7
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.556

each other a lot?</i>

8

play against each other often.</i>

9
00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.893

10
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.687

11

No one can know.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.316
<i>A lot of kids
are gonna be looking up to you.</i>

13

-My what?

14
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.192
-So. what's my name gonna be?
-Jane.

15
00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.321
How much pressure do you feel

16
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.785
from the fans. from
the hockey world in general?

17
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.287
-What was that?
-Not everything is about you!

18
00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.831
What the fuck are you doing?
We're in public.

19
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.000

I fucking mean what I mean.

82
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.108
They're burning a fake Rozanov
outside right now.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.026
The fuck does that mean?

84
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.005

No. thanks.

86
00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.324

it doesn't help me focus.

87

Yeah. Miity.
go be weird somewhere else.

88
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.327

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:53.431
Can you talk to NBC and some

92
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.796
"Now. Mr. Hollander.

93
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.340
what does Montreal have
to do to win tonight?"

94
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.802
Well. hockey is a complicated
and nuanced game.

95
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.472
but it would be helpful
if we scored more fucking goals

96
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.531
than the other team.

97
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.726
"And how about
that other team!"

98
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.728
<i>Ilya Rozanov
has been on a tear lately.</i>

99
00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.604
<i>He had a hat trick last week.</i>

100
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.315
<i>He's almost caught up to you
in the scoring race.</i>

101
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.858
Want to know what he
said about it?

102
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.136
I'll listen if he
actually catches up. Thanks.

103
00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:58.668
Wow. this Montreal girl
works you up. brother.

104
00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.628
Shut your idiot face. Marly.

105
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:02.505
You're straight up
blushing. Roz.

106
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.424
Uh. no. Never in life
have I blushed.

107
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.050
Russians do not do this.

108
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:14.225
Good game. Good game.

109
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.018
Good game. Good game.

110
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.443
You will murder me.

111
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.777
Maybe.

112
00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:26.487
Get in.

113
00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:31.659
Why the fuck did you think
it was OK

114
00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.161
to sext me before the game?

115
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.412
What the fuck?

116
00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.205
You were hard. weren't you?

117
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.166
For how long?
The whole game?

118
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.835
You're such a fucking asshole.

119
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.420
You missed me. didn't you?

120
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.880
I fucking didn't.

121
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.048
And I still beat your ass.

122
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.758
Oh. barely.

123
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.099
Wow. nice place!

124
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:56.559
Thanks.

125
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.562
I bought it a couple years ago.

126
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:02.273
but then this year.
I bought another one.

127
00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:03.733
Right next door.

128
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.068
I eventually might turn it
into one place.

129
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.571
but for now I'm renting
the next door one out.

130
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.031
Mr. Businessman.

131
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.073
Shut up.

132
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.284
Mr. Landlord.

133
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:14.660
You asked.

134
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.245
No. I didn't.

135
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.469
So where do you want me?

136
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.347
In the kitchen. on the floor?

137
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.932
Fuck you.

138
00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.312
Did your mom buy
all these pillows?

139
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:44.148
No. I hired someone.

140
00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:45.983
A designer.

141
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.611
You think there is enough?

142
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.696
You're such an asshole.

143
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.783
I think maybe you like it.

144
00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.577

the cigarettes from here.

145
00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:58.663
I had one.

146
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.008
You shouldn't be smoking.

147
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:01.958
And you shouldn't be talking.

148
00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:06.879

149
00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:09.131

152
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.148
I still want.

153
00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.949
Don't worry. It will fit.

Wow. wow.

155
00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.130

180
00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:27.830

186

I am dead.

187
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.157
That was so fucking hot.

188
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.497

195
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.063
So. obviously.
we won't see each other

196
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.606
during the Olympics. right?

197
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.191
Right.

198
00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:42.238
Your family must be happy
they're in Russia.

199
00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.406
Mmm. Yes.

200
00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:46.826
My parents are pretty
psyched for me.

201
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.463
They're pissed they can't come.

202
00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.955
but my mom's threatening
to wake up at 4:00 a.m.

203
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.456
to watch every game.

204
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:57.628
I bet your parents
will be there. right?

205
00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:59.547
My father. yes.

206
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.924
Maybe my brother. but who knows?

207
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.968
Cool.

208
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.344
Anyways. I'm psyched.

209
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.469
I've been dreaming
about it my whole life.

210
00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:10.266
Dreaming of what?
Bronze medal?

211
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.601
You fucking wish. dude.

212
00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:19.024
Hey. uh. remember when I
made you come hands-free?

213
00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.443
Go fuck yourself. Rozanov.

214
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.822
Such a good trick.

215
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.074
Your cab is definitely here.

216
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.335

Yeah. it was

235
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.571
A debacle.

236
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.032
Hey. what did Roz say about it?

237
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.701
I don't know. Nothing to me.
that's for sure.

238
00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:55.120
I think he knows Canada

239
00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:56.664
Uh-uh. It's USA

240
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:57.771
We're coming for you.

241
00:15:57.873 --> 00:15:58.833
-OK. OK.
-Trust me.

242
00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.136
You look great in silver.

243
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.502
-Oh. good one.
-Oh!

244
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.673
Does your room have that smell?

245
00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.216
Yes. Yes. it does.

246
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.509
Is it black mold?

247
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.552
'Cause that's what
JJ thinks it is.

248
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.887
He's probably right.

249
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:13.973
Good news is we're not
gonna be here long enough.

250
00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.475
Tonight. we can do men's
short form figure skating?

251
00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:19.061
My buddy Joe is in that
program. We trained together.

252
00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.771
Would you guys
be cool to do that?

253
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.106
I'd love to show up for him.

254
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:23.399
Hell yeah. man.

255
00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.370
Show up for any dude
who's that brave.

256
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.444
What do you mean?

257
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.948
Well. I'm assuming
your buddy might be gay.

258
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.658
I mean...

259
00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.411
Fucking brave for a dude to
show up to a place like this

260
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.996
and be like: "Hey. here's me."

261
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:40.374
Russia is not safe
for folks like that.

262
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:43.085
Fucking balls of steel. man.

263
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.485
Yeah!

264
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.862
Whoo-hoo!

265
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.488
Amazing.

266
00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.951
Wow! Man. your buddy
fucking killed it.

267
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.536
Fuck yeah. he did.

268
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.082
I'm just gonna
find the bathroom.

269
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.643
Hey.

270
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.483
Not here.

271
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:48.859
No. I'm not...

272
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.238
I saw you up here. I wanted to
see how you're doing.

273
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.740
Fine. Go sit down.

274
00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.660
We...

275
00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.329
We are not anything.

276
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.707
Go away. Hollander.

277
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.756
Are you OK?

278
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.217
Please. go.

279
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.385
You didn't answer my text.

280
00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.181
No. I did not answer
your boring text.

281
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.766
Now will you go?

282
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.393
Fine.

283
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.520
Fuck.

284
00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:36.415
Mmm.

285
00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:57.138
OK.

286
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.708
Hey!

287
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.167
Captain's here.

288
00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:28.211
-Cap! Cap! Cap!
-Shhh!

289
00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.848
Oh my God!
I just put them down.

290
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.882
What... what am I supposed
to do with this?

291
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.717
I don't know.
My mom told me to get wine.

292
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.634
Oh my God.

293
00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:36.928
You're so cute.

294
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:38.930
There's ginger ale
in the fridge.

295
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:41.058
Playoffs are over.
You can't keep the beard.

296
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:42.809
That's not a rule.
You made that up.

297
00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:44.160
Hollander. is that a rule?

298
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.293
Unfortunately. it is.

299
00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:46.371
Fuck you. Hollander!

300
00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:47.689
He can barely even grow one.

301
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.566
No. no. fuck you.
Swedish inbred.

302
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:50.776
-Fuck you. JJ.
-Come on.

303
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.027
Just fucking do it.

304
00:26:52.193 --> 00:26:53.361
Stop swearing!

305
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:55.697
Boys. it's starting.

306
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:56.740
Turn it up.

307
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.283
<i>It's Game 6.</i>

308
00:26:58.408 --> 00:27:00.285

310
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.624

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:06.878

312

<i>A heartbreak for the Russians</i>

313
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:09.795

<i>the young Boston captain.</i>

315

<i>He's on a tear.</i>

316

<i>scoring 10 goals over
the past 6 playoff games.</i>

317
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.053
OK. listen the fuck up!

318
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:22.599
Look. I don't give a fuck
how many goals I've scored.

319
00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:26.227
I don't give a fuck how I
played two fucking nights ago.

320
00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.021
I don't need to
think about that.

321
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.398
That was yesterday.
That was before.

322
00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:34.069
Now. I only need one thing.

323
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:38.615
I need to win.

324
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.785
Here. at home. tonight.

325
00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.538
As much fun as it would
be to go to California

326
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.040
and humiliate them there.

327
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.000
but I want to hear our fans.

328
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.711
I want to hear them scream.

329
00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:55.340
I want to fuck San Francisco.

330
00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.426
I know you can do it.

331
00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:00.053
I've seen you fucking do it.

332
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.722
I've seen every one of you
do it.

333
00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.850
So leave it all
the fuck out there tonight.

334
00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:11.815
Because this is
our fucking night.

335
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.734
This is our fucking Cup.

336
00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:17.654
Fucking fuck San Francisco!

337
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.451
Great fucking speech.

338
00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:24.786
Go fuck yourself.

339
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.668
I can't believe that asshole's
about to win the Cup.

340
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.837
Shane hates him the most.

341
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.797
-What?
-You hate Rozanov.

342
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:36.965
Of course.

343
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.509
But he's very good at hockey.

344
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:41.136
The best. probably.

345
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:43.763
Uh. no. You're the
fucking best. Hollander.

346
00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.306
Yeah.

347
00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:48.309
Not that animal shit show
cock sucking Russian.

348
00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.603

00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:57.652
<i>What a comeback story

352
00:28:57.777 --> 00:29:00.613

353

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.528
Wow. nice watch! They give
this to you for free or what?

356
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.863
Where the fuck were you?
We're on in 5 seconds.

357
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.031
25 seconds.

358
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:45.033
What were you even doing?

359
00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:48.620
And now. presenting
the Lord Talon Award...

360
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:49.871
I was busy.

361
00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:51.206
With who?

362
00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:54.042
...Ilya Rozanov
and Shane Hollander.

363
00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:02.008
But the most important thing...

364
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.803
...is the friends
we make along the way.

365
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.765
Hey. before we give out
next award.

366
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.725
can I get a selfie with you?

367
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.352
What?

368
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:15.230
Come on. When will this
ever happen again. buddy?

369
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.232
OK. fine. but hurry up.

370
00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:26.741
Great! Give me your number.
I'll text them to you.

371
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.409
No chance.

372
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:31.079
And the Lord Talon Award

373
00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:33.581
for most sportsmanlike
player goes to...

374
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:15.540
Well...

375
00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:19.043
What?

376
00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:21.671
What the fuck
do you want. Rozanov?

377
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:25.008
You haven't answered a text
from me in. like. 6 months.

378
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.593
You won't even
acknowledge I exist

379
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.137
unless there's a fucking
camera pointed at us.

380
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:31.639
and then it's for some
fucking clown show.

381
00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:35.310
So yeah. what the fuck
do you actually want from me?

382
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:38.313
Well?

383
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.483
I want you to suck my dick.

384
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:44.819
Oh. fuck you.
You are unbelievable.

385
00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:46.988
You suck my dick.

386
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.295
Maybe ask nicely.

387
00:32:07.508 --> 00:32:08.885
Hmm?

388
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.678
Please.

389
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.743
If you want me
to get on my knees

390
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.394
on this filthy bathroom floor
and suck your dick.

391
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:21.356
you will have to
ask nicer than that.

392
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:26.778
Please get on your knees

393
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:29.864
on this filthy bathroom floor

394
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:32.158
and suck my dick.

395
00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:34.702
Please.

396
00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:45.964
No.

397
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:49.801
What?

398
00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:51.344
No.

399
00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:54.639
We will go back to our seats.

400
00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:57.350
watch the rest
of this boring show.

401
00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.727
and then go to
boring party after.

402
00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:04.273
And then. when you have been
waiting all night.

403
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.776
you'll come back to
my hotel room.

404
00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.653
and I will maybe...

405
00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:12.532
maybe do more
than just suck your dick.

406
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:17.203
When did your English
get so good?

407
00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:21.249
I. uh. I read
the <i>New Yorker</i> now.

408
00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:23.251
Really?

409
00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:26.254
No. The <i>New Yorker</i> is boring.

410
00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:29.507
My dad loves it.

411
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.721
Ah. So being boring
is... is genetic.

412
00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:35.888
Wow.

413
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:37.557
Genetic.

414
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.521
Then let's make a deal.

415
00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:46.107
If you win MVP tonight.

416
00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:49.277
I will blow you.
fuck you. whatever you want.

417
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.781
And if you win?

418
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:13.134
Good luck tonight.

419
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.180
Congratulations.

420
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:00.890
Thank you.

421
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:02.934
Now take off your clothes.

422
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.853
You're such an asshole.

423
00:35:50.606 --> 00:35:51.774
What?

424
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:54.735
Just a lot of windows.

425
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.717
Good.

426
00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.427
Now get on the bed.

427
00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:27.977
This is a good hotel.

428
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:29.312
Very nice vodka.

429
00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:31.439
It's hard to find in America.

430
00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:33.733
OK...

431
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.069
Touch yourself.

432
00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:38.988
-What?
-Show off for me.

433
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:40.031
I want to watch you.

434
00:36:40.114 --> 00:36:41.449
You what?

435
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.909
It's my special day.
Hollander. I want to watch.

436
00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:45.786
I've never...

437
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:46.871
No shit.

438
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.164
Fuck you.

439
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.291
Give me some vodka. at least.

440
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:51.542
Mmm. no. no. no.

441
00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:53.920
Vodka is for after.
as your reward.

442
00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:30.998
Do you want to know
how it feels?

443
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.335
How what feels?

444
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.045
Holding the Cup.

445
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.130
You fucking asshole.

446
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.591
Ah. I can barely describe it.

447
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:41.342
Oh my God. Hollander.

448
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.387
Ah!

449
00:37:54.397 --> 00:37:56.565
Fuck.

450
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.866
Are you gonna fuck me?

451
00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.702
We will see.

452
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:11.580
I need...

453
00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:14.125
What?

454
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.710
You know.

455
00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:17.628
Tell me.

456
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.840
You.

457
00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:27.513
I need you.

458
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:30.349
Hmm.

459
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:30.534
So. Russia this year
was something else.

460
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.123
It's intense there.

461
00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.422
So are you heading back soon?

462
00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.007
Back?

463
00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:47.927
To Russia for the summer?

464
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:50.471
Oh. yes.

465
00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:57.812
Why?

466
00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.314
What do you mean. why?

467
00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:03.692
Do you have to?

468
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:07.154
There is no "have to." It's...

469
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:09.115
It's home.

470
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.077
Yeah. but I don't know.

471
00:40:13.202 --> 00:40:14.537
Is it safe?

472
00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.456
What do you mean. "safe"?

473
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:20.126
I don't know.

474
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.838
Do you... do you even
like it there?

475
00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:31.679
What difference does it make?

476
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.598
A pretty big one. I think.

477
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.897
I need to sleep.

478
00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:44.275
Oh.

479
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.152
Yeah. me too.

480
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.028
I should. uh...

481
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:57.538
So. uh. I'm off.

482
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.041
Goodbye. Hollander.

483
00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:19.203
Fuck.
