00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:28.572

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:32.096
_

5
00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:40.723
Nowadays. the US
government can listen to anything you say.

6
00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:44.143
They know where you are.
they know who you're talking to.

7
00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:47.605
and trust me.
they know who you're fucking.

8
00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer.
and you're doomed.

9
00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:56.656
But in Colombia in 1989.
it wasn't that easy.

10
00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.950
First off.
there was no Internet.

11
00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.451
No cells.

12
00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:02.203
The best they had were satellite phones.

13
00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:06.541
and in order to capture a satellite phone.
you had to fly directly over it.

14
00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:10.920
On top of that. the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

15
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.381
the landowners. the politicians...

16
00:01:14.757 --> 00:01:18.469
And lucky for us.
the narcos were richer than them all.

17
00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:24.225
What's up. Lizard?

18
00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:27.603
We're going out tonight.

19
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.944
And once you got a signal.
you didn't know who you were listening to.

20
00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.614
That's why back then. the US government
developed software that could identify

21
00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.158
the voices of our targets.

22
00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:45.371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz.
gentlemen.

23
00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:48.499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

24
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.960
Hammer. prepare to engage.

25
00:01:51.168 --> 00:01:54.463
Once we got a target.
we still had to locate it.

26
00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:58.300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

27
00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:04.057
OK. he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

28
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.308
Hawkeye. how do you copy that?

29
00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.938
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

30
00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:12.189
La Dispensaria.

31
00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:14.859
I've got a table ready.

32
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.487
Show up around midnight.

33
00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it.

34
00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.910
but he'd just made himself a date.

35
00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:27.914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

36
00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:29.874
Hammer. disengage.

37
00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

38
00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

39
00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

40
00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:42.470
By "the other guy." he meant me.

41
00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:45.723
I'm Steve Murphy.
Drug Enforcement Agent.

42
00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:50.352
And as you can see.
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

43
00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.479
Hello?

44
00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:54.023
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

45
00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:54.941
Got it.

46
00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

47
00:02:57.735 --> 00:02:59.070
OK.

48
00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:01.739
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself.

49
00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:05.160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

50
00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:09.246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

51
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.498
Hola.

52
00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:14.251
La Dispensaria?

53
00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:15.377
All right.

54
00:03:18.047 --> 00:03:19.381
Guess who that was.

55
00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:21.717
Your partner.

56
00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.512
He just gave me a great gift.

57
00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:26.973
Poison.

58
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.063
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

59
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.315
Yeah. sure.

60
00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:38.526
He's not a fool.

61
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.820
Gotta go.

62
00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:44.907
Gonna stick me with the bill?

63
00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:51.455
Cheap son of a bitch.

64
00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.167
In case you're wondering.
this is the asshole.

65
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.128
Javier Peña. my partner.

66
00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.715
And this is Colonel Carrillo.
the leader of the Search Bloc.

67
00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

68
00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:06.637
Boy. did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

69
00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:14.436
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

70
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.355
Especially the local hitmen.

71
00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:18.191
Colombians call them sicarios.

72
00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.027
- What's up. son?
- Hey. brother.

73
00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:24.530
Let's go inside and have a good time.

74
00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:26.615
Now. Poison. he was one of the best.

75
00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:30.619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

76
00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.163
Probably hundreds.

77
00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.040
But don't get me wrong.

78
00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:37.376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

79
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

80
00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:49.430
It's on. boys!

81
00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.767
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

82
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.895
Riano. Trujillo.
you're in the front with me.

83
00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:58.189
- Galvis and Silva. you take up the rear.
- Yes. sir.

84
00:04:58.273 --> 00:05:00.775
You got it. boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

85
00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:03.652
We're gonna kill these fuckers.
all right?

86
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.154
Yes. sir!

87
00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:20.253
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

88
00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.676
Yeah. I pushed the buttons.

89
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.191
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

90
00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:10.748
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

91
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.367
My fellow Americans...

92
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.785
Take Richard Nixon. for instance.

93
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:20.956
People forget.
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

94
00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.959
We thought he was one of the good guys.

95
00:07:24.168 --> 00:07:27.255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

96
00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:29.048
because he hated the commies.

97
00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:31.717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

98
00:07:36.597 --> 00:07:39.934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

99
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:45.689
Maybe not such a good guy after all.

100
00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:55.241
But sometimes.
bad guys do good things.

101
00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.705
Nobody knows this. but back in '73.
Chile was on its way

102
00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:05.709
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

103
00:08:07.002 --> 00:08:10.672
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

104
00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:14.302
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

105
00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:15.511
to ship the product north.

106
00:08:15.594 --> 00:08:19.265
To be productive.
you can't waste money! Come on!

107
00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:22.351
You're surrounded!

108
00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.853
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

109
00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.481
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

110
00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:28.441
What the fuck is going on here?

111
00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:29.525
On the ground!

112
00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:33.862
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

113
00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:39.994
And then. being Pinochet...

114
00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:43.080
he had them all killed.

115
00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:45.791
Attention!

116
00:08:45.874 --> 00:08:48.419
Weapons ready!

117
00:08:48.503 --> 00:08:49.920
Aim!

118
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:51.922
Ready ammunition!

119
00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:54.883
Fire!

120
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:07.896
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world.

121
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.900
only the cockroaches will survive.

122
00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.694
I guess they were right.

123
00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:20.951
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno.
aka Cockroach.

124
00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:23.287
and he was smart enough to play dead.

125
00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.501
He wasn't killed on that day.

126
00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:33.922
Instead. he won the damn lottery.

127
00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:41.013
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

128
00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:44.433
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

129
00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:48.020
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

130
00:09:48.103 --> 00:09:51.482
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

131
00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:54.443
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

132
00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:59.990
- But you're not a communist.
- No. not a communist. something worse.

133
00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:02.410
A drug trafficker.

134
00:10:02.493 --> 00:10:05.746
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes. a drug trafficker.

135
00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:12.253
Back then. we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

136
00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:15.172
on the human brain.

137
00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:18.509
We didn't know much. but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

138
00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.928
...this will give us better results. OK?

139
00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:24.223
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

140
00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:27.518
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

141
00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:33.441
It would choose cocaine over sleep.
over sex... over life itself.

142
00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:36.652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

143
00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:40.906
unless we're talking about cocaine.

144
00:10:47.204 --> 00:10:49.373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

145
00:10:50.374 --> 00:10:52.709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

146
00:10:52.793 --> 00:10:54.169
Gracias.

147
00:10:56.213 --> 00:10:58.924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

148
00:10:59.007 --> 00:11:00.134
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

149
00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.348
Like Goldilocks.
he had three options.

150
00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:09.685
And pay attention. because all three
are important to this story.

151
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge. that's Fabio on the horse.

152
00:11:17.652 --> 00:11:21.363
A typical Colombian smuggling family.

153
00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.865
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

154
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.119
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

155
00:11:28.162 --> 00:11:31.957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha.

156
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.836
nicknamed "The Mexican."
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

157
00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:38.714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

158
00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:49.183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade.
even by Colombian standards.

159
00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:50.767
If you make it to the top...

160
00:11:52.227 --> 00:11:55.230
it means you've killed your enemies.

161
00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.360
Hey. partner. What are you doing here?

162
00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:01.195
And sometimes. your partners.

163
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

164
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

165
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.761
Yeah. you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

166
00:12:25.844 --> 00:12:28.180
The man who would
change my life forever.

167
00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:33.394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

168
00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:35.937
Cigarettes. alcohol. marijuana.
you name it.

169
00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.817
At the time.
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

170
00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:45.406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

171
00:12:46.574 --> 00:12:48.701
They didn't play by the same rules.

172
00:12:50.244 --> 00:12:51.579
Good day.

173
00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:53.622
Pablo Escobar?

174
00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.123
Where's Felipo?

175
00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:57.251
Felipo's been arrested.

176
00:12:57.334 --> 00:12:59.127
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

177
00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:02.214
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

178
00:13:02.297 --> 00:13:04.717
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

179
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.927
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax. Gustavo. please.

180
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.596
Show some respect.

181
00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:13.016
Now what's the problem.
Mr. Jose Luis?

182
00:13:15.477 --> 00:13:17.104
How do you know my name?

183
00:13:17.312 --> 00:13:19.356
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

184
00:13:22.317 --> 00:13:24.069
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

185
00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:31.118
There's Garcia. Lopez...

186
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:33.245
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes. Pinilla.

187
00:13:33.328 --> 00:13:34.455
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:36.039
Pinilla...

189
00:13:36.123 --> 00:13:37.958
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

190
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:40.127
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

191
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.754
I don't have all day.

192
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.551
Open it.

193
00:13:56.977 --> 00:13:58.604
Tell me something. Mr. Escobar.

194
00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:01.398
Who the fuck do you think you are?

195
00:14:01.482 --> 00:14:04.901
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

196
00:14:04.985 --> 00:14:06.779
Because I pay for the privilege. Colonel.

197
00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:08.572
Oh. yeah? You don't say.

198
00:14:08.656 --> 00:14:10.449
Where are your import papers?

199
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.786
You need papers for these TV sets.

200
00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:15.287
Take them.

201
00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:22.085
Sorry. Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

202
00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:24.505
- Look. brother. it's not for you.
- Then who?

203
00:14:24.588 --> 00:14:26.381
It's for Carlitos.

204
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.425
Your son.

205
00:14:30.594 --> 00:14:33.305
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

206
00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:36.809
Hey. Pinilla!

207
00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:42.189
Your daughter just
got her driver's license. right?

208
00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:48.195
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

209
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:53.492
That friend of yours. Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

210
00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:56.995
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

211
00:14:57.078 --> 00:14:58.873
Your wife is gorgeous. brother.

212
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.834
What's she doing with a guy like you?

213
00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:10.676
I think she deserves some jewelry. no?

214
00:15:12.887 --> 00:15:15.890
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

215
00:15:19.976 --> 00:15:22.479
Colonel. how is your mom doing?

216
00:15:22.563 --> 00:15:25.733
- She just got out of the hospital. right?
- Yes. she's feeling better.

217
00:15:25.816 --> 00:15:28.985
- Good. That makes us happy. right?
- Yes.

218
00:15:30.237 --> 00:15:31.530
Gentlemen...

219
00:15:32.614 --> 00:15:34.783
I'm going to tell you who I am.

220
00:15:35.992 --> 00:15:39.162
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

221
00:15:40.247 --> 00:15:42.541
My eyes are everywhere.

222
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.587
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

223
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.755
without me knowing about it.

224
00:15:48.004 --> 00:15:50.925
Do you understand? Not a finger.

225
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:57.765
One day. I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

226
00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:02.895
So look. I make deals for a living.

227
00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:06.523
Now. you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

228
00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:09.860
or accept the consequences.

229
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.865
Silver...

230
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.076
or lead.

231
00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.121
You decide.

232
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.711
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right. then.

233
00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.383
Yo. Pablo!

234
00:17:16.134 --> 00:17:17.845
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

235
00:17:17.928 --> 00:17:19.888
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

236
00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.474
No. no. no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

237
00:17:22.557 --> 00:17:24.476
All right.
yesterday we were talking.

238
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:29.023
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

239
00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:30.482
Explain.

240
00:17:30.565 --> 00:17:33.610
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

241
00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:35.737
I will handle
the chemical part of production.

242
00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.323
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

243
00:17:38.406 --> 00:17:40.826
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

244
00:17:41.035 --> 00:17:44.287
Now tell him how much it costs.

245
00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:48.333
In Chile. this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

246
00:17:48.542 --> 00:17:52.170
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes. it's very good. Look...

247
00:17:52.253 --> 00:17:57.467
You do a little bit. and in 20 minutes.
you want to do some more.

248
00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.053
Also...

249
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.472
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

250
00:18:02.556 --> 00:18:05.100
It's very clean. this stuff.
Want some?

251
00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:08.812
If this is really that good
and we can make some money.

252
00:18:08.896 --> 00:18:10.814
we can find room on our trucks.

253
00:18:10.898 --> 00:18:13.358
We can sell it in Bogotá. Barranquilla.
Cali. Cartagena...

254
00:18:13.567 --> 00:18:15.819
We're going to be rich.

255
00:18:15.903 --> 00:18:18.655
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

256
00:18:20.448 --> 00:18:22.117
Well look. Cuca...

257
00:18:23.077 --> 00:18:25.120
you don't have any vision.
my friend.

258
00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:30.125
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

259
00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:34.379
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

260
00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:39.968
I love that song.

261
00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:44.723
Rodrigo! One more.

262
00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:10.582
Back then. Miami was a paradise.

263
00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:13.543
I signed up for the sand.
surf and women.

264
00:19:15.253 --> 00:19:18.465
In '79. the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

265
00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:19.716
DEA! Stop!

266
00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:23.929
I was a young DEA agent.
partnered with my buddy. Kevin Brady.

267
00:19:25.139 --> 00:19:27.182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

268
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.728
Why you running. huh?

269
00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

270
00:19:34.898 --> 00:19:35.816
What is that?

271
00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:39.027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

272
00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:41.196
Let's go celebrate.

273
00:19:41.404 --> 00:19:42.864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

274
00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:47.828
Go! Go! Go!

275
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:50.371
How you like me now?

276
00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:51.623
How much money you owe me?

277
00:19:51.832 --> 00:19:53.458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

278
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:55.169
That's right. that's right.

279
00:19:57.754 --> 00:20:00.757
All right.
All right. who do we pick?

280
00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.467
How 'bout her?

281
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.969
No. no. no.
we gotta fuck with him.

282
00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:06.054
- Yeah. let's mess with his head.
- Um...

283
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.973
Oh. right there.
See her? At the bar?

284
00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:10.184
- Which one?
- Blue top. blond hair. That's his type.

285
00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:13.353
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

286
00:20:13.436 --> 00:20:14.729
- All right.
- Whoo!

287
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.940
Murph! Sparrow. three o'clock.

288
00:20:17.024 --> 00:20:20.861
Hey. while you were walking back.
she was checking your ass out.

289
00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:22.487
Oh. she was checking out your ass.

290
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

291
00:20:24.072 --> 00:20:27.951
Listen. she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

292
00:20:28.035 --> 00:20:30.704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

293
00:20:30.912 --> 00:20:34.332
I'm serious. I'm serious. Look at her.

294
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:37.127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

295
00:20:37.211 --> 00:20:38.753
No. the other one.
Of course the blond one.

296
00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.547
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

297
00:20:41.297 --> 00:20:44.592
You dicking me around?

298
00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:48.930
Fuck it. I'm going in.

299
00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:50.182
- Go get her.
- Mm!

300
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:52.059
- Yup.
- Hey. while you're up there.

301
00:20:52.142 --> 00:20:53.643

302
00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:56.855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

303
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.366
How you doing?

304
00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.202
Busy.

305
00:21:11.828 --> 00:21:15.331
I just said. "Look. if you don't
wanna be there. you don't have to be.

306
00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:18.626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So. I don't know...

307
00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.674
Yeah. those bastards got me.

308
00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:27.094
But I couldn't let it end like that.

309
00:21:27.177 --> 00:21:30.013
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

310
00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:32.599
Uh. they're fucking with me.

311
00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:36.144
Telling me you were checking out my ass.
and who checks out a cop's ass. right?

312
00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.478
You're a cop?

313
00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.898
Not a cop. actually. I'm DEA.

314
00:21:40.107 --> 00:21:41.149
Drug Enforcement?

315
00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:43.235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

316
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.613
Come on. why don't you do me a favor?

317
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:49.283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you. uh...

318
00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:51.076
give me your phone number?

319
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.494
How about a fake number?

320
00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.580
That'll work.

321
00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:58.125
Hey. buddy. you got a pen?

322
00:22:12.806 --> 00:22:15.391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

323
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.894
Have a good night.

324
00:22:20.563 --> 00:22:23.275
Aah...

325
00:22:23.358 --> 00:22:24.525
Shot down!

326
00:22:25.693 --> 00:22:28.363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh. I...

327
00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:30.531
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

328
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

329
00:22:34.077 --> 00:22:36.537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

330
00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.290
How much did that cost you?

331
00:22:38.373 --> 00:22:40.500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

332
00:22:47.215 --> 00:22:49.592
I figured. what the hell.

333
00:22:49.676 --> 00:22:53.096
Worst that could happen.
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

334
00:22:59.477 --> 00:23:00.687
Hello?

335
00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:03.648
So it wasn't a fake.

336
00:23:03.857 --> 00:23:06.193
I thought you might figure it out.

337
00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:08.695
After all. you're DEA.

338
00:23:08.778 --> 00:23:12.157
And just like that... she had me.

339
00:23:13.574 --> 00:23:18.621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru.

340
00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:20.498
cocaine had him.

341
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:24.919
It's been a while.

342
00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.588
These are my friends.
Pablo and Gustavo.

343
00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:31.092
Would you like a little coffee?

344
00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:32.802
Yeah. a coffee?

345
00:23:32.886 --> 00:23:33.887
Yes. a coffee.

346
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.055
- How about you. Pablo?
- No.

347
00:23:35.138 --> 00:23:36.681
You sure?

348
00:23:36.764 --> 00:23:40.894
My factory is small.
but highly productive.

349
00:23:40.977 --> 00:23:45.857
Look. For crushing the leaves. I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

350
00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.610
Little magic leaves.

351
00:23:50.528 --> 00:23:53.448
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

352
00:23:53.531 --> 00:23:59.495
Over here. the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

353
00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:04.667
Then you cut it.
and mix it with gasoline.

354
00:24:04.751 --> 00:24:08.755
Then. basically. you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

355
00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:10.673
Let it dry. dry. dry.

356
00:24:10.757 --> 00:24:12.508
You use ammonia to get the paste.

357
00:24:12.592 --> 00:24:18.139
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

358
00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:20.475
Here is the prize.

359
00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:22.977
It's like the kitchen in your house.

360
00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:27.065
Like baking a cake.

361
00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:31.069
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

362
00:24:33.238 --> 00:24:35.365
Look. an old press. an antique.

363
00:24:39.827 --> 00:24:42.956
Now we put it in the oven.

364
00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:45.666
Here's one.
The other will follow.

365
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.836
All natural. organic and healthy.
Very good.

366
00:24:49.712 --> 00:24:51.089
Well...

367
00:24:52.173 --> 00:24:55.635
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

368
00:24:55.718 --> 00:24:58.930
- No.
- You said a kilo.

369
00:24:59.013 --> 00:25:00.432
We'll take five.

370
00:25:00.515 --> 00:25:04.436
How do we get five across the border?

371
00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.396
That's Gustavo's department.

372
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.112
This one has got a good engine.

373
00:25:14.195 --> 00:25:16.823
I was taking a look at it.
and the best place to hide the merchandise

374
00:25:16.906 --> 00:25:19.117
would be under the rear wheel well.

375
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.328
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

376
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:22.745
Is this easy to take off?

377
00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:25.540
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

378
00:25:25.623 --> 00:25:28.001
All right. all right.
I'll take three cars. please.

379
00:25:28.084 --> 00:25:31.045
- Sure. when do you need them?
- Now. brother.

380
00:25:31.838 --> 00:25:34.715
All right. we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

381
00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.968
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

382
00:25:37.051 --> 00:25:42.223
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

383
00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.518
For three cars. that's 60 kilos.

384
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.937
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram. what?

385
00:25:48.021 --> 00:25:49.564
$9.000 per kilo.

386
00:25:49.647 --> 00:25:52.192
$9.000 times 60...
The profit is $540.000.

387
00:25:52.275 --> 00:25:54.486
That's it!

388
00:25:54.569 --> 00:25:56.404
- Do you know how to drive. Cockroach?
- Yeah.

389
00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:58.198
OK. Pablo and I drive fast.

390
00:25:58.406 --> 00:26:02.160
That's half a million dollars... per trip.

391
00:26:02.243 --> 00:26:05.372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

392
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.959
Easiest money he ever made.

393
00:26:15.298 --> 00:26:18.218
Back in Medellín.
Pablo didn't waste any time.

394
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:19.969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

395
00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:25.099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

396
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.935
How are you feeling. Gustavo?

397
00:26:29.563 --> 00:26:31.523
All this smells like shit to me.

398
00:26:31.606 --> 00:26:35.151
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

399
00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:37.571
The stinkier. the better.

400
00:26:38.238 --> 00:26:39.489
All right.

401
00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:42.325
What about all these lights?

402
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.413
Is that to tip off the cops.
or what?

403
00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:50.833
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

404
00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:53.836
I'm the artist here. clear?

405
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.129
Clear.

406
00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

407
00:26:57.424 --> 00:27:01.719
It was a mom-and-pop operation.
so small they called it The Kitchen.

408
00:27:01.802 --> 00:27:05.557
But make no mistake.
it would change Medellín forever.

409
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.101
You know the thing
that has me worried. Pablo?

410
00:27:14.441 --> 00:27:17.569
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

411
00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:26.869
Let's build them a chimney.

412
00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:33.167
There you go.

413
00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:37.171
Gentlemen. the first three?

414
00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:40.716
If this business makes so much money.
why are you sending me coach?

415
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.843
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

416
00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:46.180
- Don't be a dick.
- No. no. don't give me that dumb shit.

417
00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:49.767
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

418
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.936
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

419
00:27:55.148 --> 00:27:58.985
Like her son. Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

420
00:27:59.694 --> 00:28:03.197
Hey. Mom.
how much do you think we can fit in there?

421
00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:06.701
- Around five kilos. honey.
- That much?

422
00:28:06.784 --> 00:28:08.202
Trust me. Pablito.

423
00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.246
I love it. Let's do it.

424
00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:16.252
- Pablo.
- Thank you. my love.

425
00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:20.590
It's Gustavo.

426
00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:22.800
Five kilos. right?

427
00:28:22.883 --> 00:28:26.429
Pablo loved his young bride Tata.
and she loved him.

428
00:28:26.513 --> 00:28:28.931
He was a family man till the end.

429
00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:32.185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

430
00:28:32.268 --> 00:28:34.103
- Meet my friend.
- Hello. how are you doing?

431
00:28:34.187 --> 00:28:35.313
Hey. Pablo. this is Lion.

432
00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:38.525
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

433
00:28:38.608 --> 00:28:40.943
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich. right?

434
00:28:41.027 --> 00:28:43.029
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

435
00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:44.656
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you. Lion.

436
00:28:44.739 --> 00:28:45.990
Here's three.

437
00:28:46.073 --> 00:28:48.702
We're going to need two more.
right. Mom?

438
00:28:48.784 --> 00:28:50.578
- That's right.
- Pablito...

439
00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:53.080
make sure it is not you
who wears it. OK?

440
00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:56.417
Look. my love...
it won't fit me.

441
00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:58.252
Try it on.

442
00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.546
Come here.

443
00:28:59.629 --> 00:29:01.422
That's it.

444
00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:02.923
Good. right?

445
00:29:05.468 --> 00:29:06.511
One...

446
00:29:07.762 --> 00:29:09.889
- two...
- Wow. it holds a lot!

447
00:29:09.972 --> 00:29:11.432
...three.

448
00:29:13.226 --> 00:29:15.269
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

449
00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:17.021
He looks really handsome.
doesn't he?

450
00:29:17.104 --> 00:29:19.982
Listen. Lion.
that jacket fits you very nicely.

451
00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:23.653
Yeah. Excuse me. ma'am. can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

452
00:29:23.737 --> 00:29:25.238
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

453
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:27.407
He looks very handsome. son.

454
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.825
Like a fag model. isn't that right?

455
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.830
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

456
00:29:37.917 --> 00:29:39.252
Welcome to the United States.

457
00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:42.004
Thank you.
Have a great day.

458
00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:42.963
Next. please.

459
00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:46.842
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder.

460
00:29:46.926 --> 00:29:51.806
half Colombian. half German.
and 100 percent playboy.

461
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:55.184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

462
00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:57.061
Go figure.

463
00:29:57.144 --> 00:30:01.065
Back in '79. this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

464
00:30:01.148 --> 00:30:02.734
on a fleet of small planes.

465
00:30:02.817 --> 00:30:04.736
- What's up?
- What's up. son?

466
00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:06.862
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

467
00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:08.448
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

468
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:10.157
Whoo! It's so hot.

469
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:12.118
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

470
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:13.578
You like my jacket. brother?

471
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:16.790
I got it in Colombia and look.
it has a little gift.

472
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.419
I was in jail for a while. remember?

473
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.548
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

474
00:30:25.632 --> 00:30:28.426
What you got there
is the perfect product.

475
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:30.970
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

476
00:30:31.053 --> 00:30:33.889
It's gonna fuck up their brains.
that's for sure.

477
00:30:33.973 --> 00:30:35.015
Yes. sir.

478
00:30:38.728 --> 00:30:39.895
Here you go.

479
00:30:41.355 --> 00:30:43.483
Go on. There are five kilos.

480
00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:45.318
Where are you going?

481
00:30:45.568 --> 00:30:47.987
I'm gonna get another jacket.
brother.

482
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.406
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow.
all right?

483
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.288
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

484
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:59.666
Drugs in. cash out.

485
00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:03.002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

486
00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:06.547
And in no time.
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

487
00:31:07.674 --> 00:31:10.217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes.

488
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:12.679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

489
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:15.765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

490
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

491
00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

492
00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:25.817
Ten trucks. 20 kilos each.
going back and forth every day...

493
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

494
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.448
Pretty soon.
the Lion had to come up with new ways

495
00:31:32.532 --> 00:31:34.617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

496
00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:37.328
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

497
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:39.914
You guys are pilots.

498
00:31:39.997 --> 00:31:43.376
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

499
00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:49.298
Look. it's $150.000 per kilo.
so whatever you want.

500
00:31:50.925 --> 00:31:52.343
We'll take four.

501
00:31:52.426 --> 00:31:53.887
All right. much better.

502
00:31:53.969 --> 00:31:58.683
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

503
00:31:58.766 --> 00:32:01.811
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

504
00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:03.437
- See you later.
- Later.

505
00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.148
Come in. please.

506
00:32:11.278 --> 00:32:14.031
Look. here are the packets.

507
00:32:14.114 --> 00:32:17.702
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

508
00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:19.078
Easy. right?

509
00:32:19.161 --> 00:32:21.706
You swallow 50.
and I pay you $10.000.

510
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:22.874
All right?

511
00:32:22.957 --> 00:32:25.042
But with you two.
we have a problem.

512
00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:27.044
You girls are pregnant. right?

513
00:32:27.127 --> 00:32:31.758
That's good. because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

514
00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:36.679
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

515
00:32:36.763 --> 00:32:39.891
And I'll pay you $15.000
to help you with the kids.

516
00:32:39.974 --> 00:32:42.435
All right? All right. Perfect.

517
00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:46.355
During the early '80s.
most flights out of Bogotá

518
00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:48.274
had several mules on them.

519
00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:50.443
They didn't even know about each other.

520
00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:52.111
And you know what?

521
00:32:52.194 --> 00:32:56.323
Getting in was easy. because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

522
00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:58.367
All we cared about was grass.

523
00:33:01.454 --> 00:33:05.959
Pretty soon. cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

524
00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:10.087
Fish. coffee. flowers. rubber hoses...
anything.

525
00:33:27.229 --> 00:33:29.148
But even that didn't do it.

526
00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:34.487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

527
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.700
Do you trust this guy?

528
00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:42.369
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

529
00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:45.539
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh. for sure he's gay.

530
00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:47.249
But he's got good routes.

531
00:33:51.337 --> 00:33:52.964
- Amigos!
- Hello. Carlos.

532
00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:54.423
Gustavo Gaviria.
nice to meet you.

533
00:33:54.507 --> 00:33:55.758
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

534
00:33:55.842 --> 00:33:57.677
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

535
00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

536
00:34:00.847 --> 00:34:02.348
Smooth.

537
00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:03.683
Let's get down to business.

538
00:34:03.766 --> 00:34:07.645
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

539
00:34:07.728 --> 00:34:10.982
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

540
00:34:11.774 --> 00:34:13.776
- How far?
- Miami.

541
00:34:17.655 --> 00:34:20.240
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

542
00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:22.076
Counting the gasoline.

543
00:34:30.877 --> 00:34:32.003
Carlos...

544
00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.005
Yes?

545
00:34:38.133 --> 00:34:41.428
What if we take out the seats.
the carpet and all the other crap

546
00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:45.307
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

547
00:34:45.391 --> 00:34:47.142
We'll leave the engine. right?

548
00:34:48.435 --> 00:34:49.937
How much more?

549
00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.439
About... 300 more.

550
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:57.486
All right then. Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

551
00:35:00.114 --> 00:35:01.908
Within months after meeting Cockroach.

552
00:35:01.991 --> 00:35:07.080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

553
00:35:08.414 --> 00:35:11.751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics. folks.

554
00:35:12.752 --> 00:35:15.922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

555
00:35:16.005 --> 00:35:17.506
in the middle of the jungle.

556
00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:22.553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest.

557
00:35:22.636 --> 00:35:27.641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

558
00:35:31.645 --> 00:35:33.940
We brought you a little present.

559
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.317
Brazilians.

560
00:35:38.945 --> 00:35:42.197
Best asses in the world.
believe me.

561
00:35:42.281 --> 00:35:44.784
No. I'm not feeling well.

562
00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:46.410
- What's up. Cuca?
- Hello.

563
00:35:47.286 --> 00:35:48.370
Hey. Gustavo.

564
00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:51.832
What the fuck is up with you guys?

565
00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:54.585
You're flying around in planes...

566
00:35:54.668 --> 00:35:56.963
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look. Cuca--

567
00:35:57.046 --> 00:35:59.715
Look. let us explain what we have to--

568
00:35:59.799 --> 00:36:01.467
Wait.

569
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.845
From now on.
in all of my labs...

570
00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:09.516
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning. with a pool...

571
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.019
- And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.

572
00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.521
- Just for you.
- One problem.

573
00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:18.525
These are my labs. Mm?

574
00:36:24.406 --> 00:36:28.619
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

575
00:36:28.702 --> 00:36:31.122
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

576
00:36:31.371 --> 00:36:34.458
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

577
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:38.212
They were violent. crazy and filthy rich.

578
00:36:38.295 --> 00:36:41.507
Guys used to getting what they want.
one way or another.

579
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:45.302
How something like this
can make so much money!

580
00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:49.556
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

581
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.600
What do you think. Pablo?

582
00:36:51.684 --> 00:36:54.061
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

583
00:36:54.269 --> 00:36:55.813
I wouldn't get involved.

584
00:36:55.896 --> 00:36:59.150
Look. man.
I took a good look at the market.

585
00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:01.485
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

586
00:37:01.568 --> 00:37:05.948
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

587
00:37:06.032 --> 00:37:08.951
Be careful. guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time.

588
00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.746
the Peruvians will raise the price.

589
00:37:14.248 --> 00:37:16.750
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

590
00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:20.254
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

591
00:37:20.337 --> 00:37:25.092
Well. guys. the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

592
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.555
You need a lot of creativity for that.

593
00:37:30.347 --> 00:37:33.809
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

594
00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:37.688
You deliver the product to me. labeled.

595
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:41.316
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

596
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.986
Better yet. Lehder will do it.

597
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.156
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value.

598
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.744
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

599
00:37:51.827 --> 00:37:53.662
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

600
00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:55.497
Deal?

601
00:37:58.751 --> 00:37:59.919
Deal.

602
00:38:00.627 --> 00:38:02.213
Sounds good to me.

603
00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:07.676
All right.
I will create my own routes

604
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.305
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

605
00:38:11.388 --> 00:38:13.266
We expect nothing less. Gonzalo.

606
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:15.726
Partners?

607
00:38:19.813 --> 00:38:22.608
We know your policy toward partners.

608
00:38:24.193 --> 00:38:25.861
Let's just call us...

609
00:38:26.112 --> 00:38:27.696
"friendly associates."

610
00:38:29.531 --> 00:38:30.991
To Miami.

611
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.160
To Miami!

612
00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:47.841
When I started. a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

613
00:38:54.056 --> 00:38:57.768
And before long.
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

614
00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

615
00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:12.325
Truth is.
we weren't even making a dent.

616
00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:16.578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

617
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.007
Pablo's coke flooded in.

618
00:39:29.049 --> 00:39:31.551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

619
00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.095
And I mean that.

620
00:39:33.929 --> 00:39:37.350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

621
00:39:38.851 --> 00:39:40.353
And with the money...

622
00:39:41.436 --> 00:39:43.314
came the violence.

623
00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:47.484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians.

624
00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:50.237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

625
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

626
00:40:18.807 --> 00:40:21.143
Use 'em once.
then throw 'em away.

627
00:40:22.561 --> 00:40:26.648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

628
00:40:26.732 --> 00:40:29.609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

629
00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.653
to hold all the extra corpses.

630
00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.699
That was the first person I ever shot.

631
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

632
00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:01.975
Hey... it was self-defense.

633
00:41:02.184 --> 00:41:05.145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

634
00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

635
00:41:09.149 --> 00:41:10.776
He sells drugs. right?

636
00:41:12.194 --> 00:41:14.071
- Yeah.
- Yeah. then fuck him.

637
00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:22.371
What happened?

638
00:41:25.665 --> 00:41:28.210
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

639
00:41:28.461 --> 00:41:30.545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

640
00:41:30.629 --> 00:41:31.964
Stay with me.

641
00:41:32.172 --> 00:41:33.632
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

642
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

643
00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:41.265
By the time she got to us.
she was barely breathing.

644
00:41:41.348 --> 00:41:45.102
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils. rapid pulse.

645
00:41:45.185 --> 00:41:47.646
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

646
00:41:47.729 --> 00:41:51.442
...but she had no residue on her nostrils.
no injection marks.

647
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.654
We did everything we could.

648
00:41:56.738 --> 00:41:58.365
She died in the ER.

649
00:42:00.742 --> 00:42:02.536
We tried to save the baby...

650
00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:10.085
The baby died in my hands.

651
00:42:12.838 --> 00:42:14.340
I'm so sorry.

652
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

653
00:42:19.011 --> 00:42:20.720
Two of the pellets split open.

654
00:42:22.597 --> 00:42:26.268
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

655
00:42:28.562 --> 00:42:30.272
No one survives that.

656
00:42:37.904 --> 00:42:41.325
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

657
00:42:41.408 --> 00:42:45.120
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

658
00:42:45.204 --> 00:42:47.373
Tell me something. Cockroach.

659
00:42:47.456 --> 00:42:50.083
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

660
00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:53.670
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

661
00:42:53.753 --> 00:42:58.717
If it wasn't for me. you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

662
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.594
Let me give you a piece of advice.

663
00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:04.056
Never say that to Pablo.

664
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:07.142
He's not as forgiving as I am.

665
00:43:13.148 --> 00:43:15.234
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

666
00:43:15.442 --> 00:43:18.695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

667
00:43:18.778 --> 00:43:22.616
Instead. he found another way
to get his fair share.

668
00:43:25.411 --> 00:43:28.038
Stop!

669
00:43:38.424 --> 00:43:40.509
What do you have in the spare tires?

670
00:43:43.303 --> 00:43:46.681
390 kilos. Pablo.
We lost it.

671
00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:51.019
Gustavo. what do you mean
"we lost it"?

672
00:43:51.103 --> 00:43:52.979
Just what I said. we lost it.

673
00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:59.194
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

674
00:43:59.278 --> 00:44:02.322
Don't mess with me. Pablo.
We lost it.

675
00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:05.700
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

676
00:44:06.993 --> 00:44:08.120
Look...

677
00:44:09.121 --> 00:44:14.418
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

678
00:44:16.378 --> 00:44:18.422
So how did we lose a load. brother?

679
00:44:18.505 --> 00:44:21.883
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

680
00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:23.469
Know what I mean?

681
00:44:29.141 --> 00:44:30.809
And how much is he asking?

682
00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:33.395
Too much.

683
00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:40.944
What are you going to do?

684
00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.656
Come back. Pablo.

685
00:44:45.157 --> 00:44:48.076
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

686
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.828
Where are you going. Pablo?

687
00:44:50.537 --> 00:44:51.788
Pablo?

688
00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.923
What's going on. brother?

689
00:45:45.925 --> 00:45:47.260
Mr. Escobar...

690
00:45:48.637 --> 00:45:51.640
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

691
00:45:56.478 --> 00:45:59.272
Eat. Shit.

692
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.860
What if I shot you in the head?

693
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.961
Are you sure about this. Colonel?

694
00:46:24.464 --> 00:46:27.426
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

695
00:46:27.509 --> 00:46:31.846
We're DAS. Ibarra.

696
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:33.890
What's that faggot gonna do?

697
00:46:37.436 --> 00:46:38.895
There we are.

698
00:46:38.978 --> 00:46:40.773
No. lower. lower.

699
00:46:40.855 --> 00:46:42.190
No that low.

700
00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.361
Ready.

701
00:46:50.824 --> 00:46:52.826
Another one. another one.
I'm ready.

702
00:46:56.996 --> 00:46:59.499
Pablo didn't know it then...

703
00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:03.336
...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

704
00:47:07.006 --> 00:47:09.301
Remove the handcuffs.

705
00:47:14.556 --> 00:47:16.141
You can go now. officer.

706
00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.144
Sit down. Mr. Pablo.

707
00:47:25.484 --> 00:47:28.278
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

708
00:47:30.196 --> 00:47:35.201
That's a street value
of over four million dollars. Mr. Escobar.

709
00:47:35.952 --> 00:47:38.371
And you only gave us $150.000.

710
00:47:39.914 --> 00:47:42.501
Well. that's what we agreed upon.

711
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.545
You know something?

712
00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:48.674
I make deals for a living.

713
00:47:48.757 --> 00:47:53.804
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

714
00:47:57.516 --> 00:48:00.686
Or we can renegotiate.
come to an agreement.

715
00:48:00.769 --> 00:48:03.313
and everyone goes home happy.

716
00:48:05.858 --> 00:48:06.983
Deal?

717
00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:17.536
I'll give you one million dollars...

718
00:48:19.037 --> 00:48:21.122
under one condition.

719
00:48:22.749 --> 00:48:24.042
What is it?

720
00:48:26.127 --> 00:48:30.006
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

721
00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:33.385
Otherwise. how would you know?

722
00:48:37.222 --> 00:48:39.307
Give me a name...

723
00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:44.688
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

724
00:48:48.441 --> 00:48:51.820
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

725
00:48:51.904 --> 00:48:55.073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities.

726
00:48:55.156 --> 00:48:58.827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami. too.

727
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:06.125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata.
a Colombian with a plumbing business

728
00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:08.921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

729
00:49:10.088 --> 00:49:14.843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

730
00:49:18.137 --> 00:49:19.723
The plan was to trade vehicles.

731
00:49:19.806 --> 00:49:22.893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

732
00:49:24.519 --> 00:49:27.105
1200 kilos.

733
00:49:27.188 --> 00:49:30.024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

734
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:33.612
OK. gringos.

735
00:49:33.695 --> 00:49:35.697
How's the plumbing business?

736
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:37.115
Fine.

737
00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:43.580
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

738
00:49:45.373 --> 00:49:47.500
Come on. amigo.
I'll show you.

739
00:49:49.085 --> 00:49:50.629
Everything was going perfect.

740
00:49:50.837 --> 00:49:55.717
Like I said. amigo...
100 percent pure.

741
00:49:55.801 --> 00:49:57.719
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

742
00:49:57.803 --> 00:50:00.472
Got a full load here. Murph--

743
00:50:08.062 --> 00:50:10.690
Don't move! Don't move.

744
00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:13.902
Don't move! Don't move.

745
00:50:13.986 --> 00:50:15.278
Get down!

746
00:50:18.698 --> 00:50:21.034
Hands! Down!

747
00:50:21.117 --> 00:50:22.201
Don't look at me.

748
00:50:25.705 --> 00:50:26.915
Fucking...

749
00:50:46.518 --> 00:50:51.064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz.

750
00:50:51.147 --> 00:50:54.275
after taking into account
all due considerations.

751
00:50:54.359 --> 00:50:59.572
bail has been set at two million dollars.
or a bond of $200.000.

752
00:51:00.907 --> 00:51:04.243
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

753
00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:07.413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

754
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:13.086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars.

755
00:51:13.169 --> 00:51:17.883
paid by a wire transfer from. well...
why don't you take a guess?

756
00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:22.428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

757
00:51:25.223 --> 00:51:31.563
From '79 to '84.
there were 3.245 murders in Miami.

758
00:51:32.647 --> 00:51:34.858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops.

759
00:51:35.067 --> 00:51:37.360
no one much cared about that.

760
00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:41.907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

761
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:46.536
Billions of dollars a year.
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

762
00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:50.623
And that... America couldn't take.

763
00:51:52.208 --> 00:51:56.462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

764
00:51:56.671 --> 00:52:00.717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

765
00:52:01.634 --> 00:52:06.098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

766
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.601
Whatever it was. the businessmen
came at just the right time.

767
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:12.520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

768
00:52:12.604 --> 00:52:15.982
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

769
00:52:16.816 --> 00:52:19.235
Drugs are menacing our society.

770
00:52:19.318 --> 00:52:22.864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

771
00:52:22.948 --> 00:52:25.033
They're killing our children.

772
00:52:25.117 --> 00:52:26.910
It was classic Reagan.

773
00:52:26.993 --> 00:52:29.913
Folksy. direct and tough.

774
00:52:29.996 --> 00:52:33.249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

775
00:52:33.458 --> 00:52:35.668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

776
00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:39.965
So to my young friends out there.
life can be great.

777
00:52:40.048 --> 00:52:42.175
But not when you can't see it.

778
00:52:42.258 --> 00:52:47.472
So open your eyes to life. to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

779
00:52:47.555 --> 00:52:49.849
as a precious gift to His children.

780
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.935
Say yes to your life.

781
00:52:52.018 --> 00:52:56.314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

782
00:52:56.397 --> 00:52:58.858
No. no. no!
No. Pablo. no. no!

783
00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:00.026
No. no!

784
00:53:04.656 --> 00:53:08.034
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world.

785
00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.120
only the cockroaches will survive.

786
00:53:10.203 --> 00:53:12.330
Leave that piece of shit there.

787
00:53:12.413 --> 00:53:14.290
I guess they were wrong.

788
00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:19.337
During his career.
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

789
00:53:20.213 --> 00:53:22.132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

790
00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:31.933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

791
00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:34.186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

792
00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.604
No way.

793
00:53:37.271 --> 00:53:41.818
He was a West Virginia farm boy.
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

794
00:53:42.777 --> 00:53:45.613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

795
00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:48.158
It was his duty.

796
00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.953
Cocaine in Miami?

797
00:53:52.037 --> 00:53:53.955
Kilos from Colombia?

798
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.333
This was my war.

799
00:53:57.416 --> 00:53:59.919
This was my duty.

800
00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.796
And I was ready to fight it.

801
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me. too.

802
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:05.758
Your ticket. please.

803
00:54:07.135 --> 00:54:08.302
OK.

804
00:54:08.386 --> 00:54:11.389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

805
00:54:12.765 --> 00:54:17.062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

806
00:54:17.145 --> 00:54:18.813
OK. man. what do we got?

807
00:54:18.897 --> 00:54:22.025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

808
00:54:22.108 --> 00:54:23.442
We got Lizard.

809
00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:26.320
Uh...

810
00:54:26.404 --> 00:54:27.822
We got. we got...

811
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

812
00:54:33.619 --> 00:54:36.289
- Thank you for the gift. agent.
- No problem.

813
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:55.975
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world.

814
00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:59.062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

815
00:55:00.105 --> 00:55:03.775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

816
00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:08.947
In the world of drug dealers.
you do what you think is right...

817
00:55:09.864 --> 00:55:11.908
and hope for the best.

818
00:55:13.034 --> 00:55:15.620
Look at what happened. boss.

819
00:55:15.703 --> 00:55:18.039
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

820
00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:23.920
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

821
00:55:24.003 --> 00:55:27.132
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

822
00:55:31.219 --> 00:55:33.888
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo. sir?

823
00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:39.769
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

824
00:55:39.852 --> 00:55:41.313
Half a million?

825
00:55:41.395 --> 00:55:42.605
Do it.

826
00:55:42.688 --> 00:55:44.190
As you wish. sir.

827
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.447
Fucking gringos.
