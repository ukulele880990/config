00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:33.720
[Steve]
By the time I left Miami.

5
00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:37.182
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.

6
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:42.812
To satisfy American noses.
the narcos ramped up their operations.

00:01:43.772 --> 00:01:44.940
[intercom dings]

8
00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:47.317
- Here. honey.
- Ah. thank you.

9
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.405
- Hey. is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

10
00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.451
[Steve]
Oh... Yeah.

11
00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:57.411
That's beautiful.

12
00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:00.830
[Steve]
They were flying so many planes.

13
00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:04.251
they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

14
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.337
So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

15
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:10.090
as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

16
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.928
Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

17
00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:16.805
- [cheering]
- [chatter in Spanish]

18
00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:21.518
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.
with the three things Carlos liked most:

19
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:26.106
- sex. drugs. and Nazi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20
00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.066
[speaking Spanish]
Let's get down!

21
00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:30.902
[all cheering]

22
00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.032
[Steve] The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.

23
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:45.625
We should be over the Amazon by now.

24
00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:52.424
[Steve] From 10.000 feet. Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

25
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.969
But things were different
on the ground.

26
00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.766
Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

27
00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:10.066
From leaf to paste to powder.
they produced 10.000 kilos a week.

28
00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:15.197
At 50 grand a kilo.
that's five billion dollars a year.

29
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.533
These guys weren't fuckin' around.

30
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:26.458
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

31
00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:31.463
They added it to liquor. to coffee.
and just to be funny...

32
00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:33.089
they put it back in Coca-Cola.

33
00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:34.466
¿Patrón?

34
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.551
Looks good?

35
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.053
[Steve] Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

36
00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.472
[speaks Spanish] This is going
to sell better than the original.

37
00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.015
It was the product.

38
00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:45.352
[Gacha speaking Spanish]
It's time to take Pablo's money.

39
00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:48.897
[Steve] The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.

40
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.859
Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.

41
00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:55.070
- [Pablo giggles]
- [Gacha speaks Spanish] Search.

42
00:03:55.153 --> 00:03:59.741
- What's happening? Look at that.
- [dog whines]

43
00:03:59.824 --> 00:04:02.869
Your prize dog didn't even stop.

44
00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:05.163
There's no coke in that boat.

45
00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:06.289
Come here.

46
00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.295
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

47
00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:16.925
Give me the money...
the cash!

48
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:19.302
Looks like you got taken
with this dog. brother.

49
00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:20.845
[Gacha chuckles dryly]

50
00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:24.433
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh. Marquessa. my dear...

51
00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:26.851
It's OK. it's OK.

52
00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:28.895
[dog whimpers. silence]

53
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.359
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?

54
00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:35.860
It's my dog.

55
00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:43.910
Son of a bitch.

56
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.454
[Gustavo]
What happened?

57
00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.956
[Gacha]
You want to know what happened? Go look.

58
00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.626
Pablo?

59
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:55.380
- Pablo. we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.

60
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.007
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

61
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:01.219
If we don't resolve this problem.
we're all dead. Come on.

62
00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:06.391
- Come on. man.
- Son of a bitch.

[counting machines whirring]

64
00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:11.020
[Pablo] Let's see...

65
00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:15.484
- This is the problem?
- [phone ringing nearby]

66
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:17.735
People are watching us. Pablo.

67
00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.614
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

68
00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:24.033
- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo. brother...

69
00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:26.911
just launder the money.

70
00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:33.710
Make it look legitimate...
that's all.

71
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.838
Isn't that what Al Capone did?

72
00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:41.384
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

73
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.513
You're a dumbass. Pablo.

74
00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:47.015
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

75
00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:49.726
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

76
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:52.395
This is too much to launder.

77
00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:54.731
Well. then...

78
00:05:56.232 --> 00:05:58.527
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

79
00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:01.154
[Steve]
And that's what they tried first.

80
00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:07.202
On paper. Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.

81
00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:08.453
He only had three cars.

82
00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:11.873
but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.

83
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.419
And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.

84
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.256
He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny.

85
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.009
then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money

86
00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:25.345
and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

87
00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:28.348
Everybody was happy.

88
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:34.771
But no matter what they did.
they couldn't hide all that money.

89
00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:37.815
It just kept coming in.

90
00:06:38.734 --> 00:06:41.194
[speaking Spanish]
You're spending too much cash. Pablo.

91
00:06:42.362 --> 00:06:45.657
You have Picassos. Dalís. farms.

92
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:49.536
houses. apartments. boats. planes. cars...

93
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.373
I told you we have to fly low.

94
00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:57.586
If you keep spending like that.
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

95
00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.004
And if that happens.
the government is going to have our asses.

96
00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:02.257
[Pablo] Enough. Gustavo. enough.

97
00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:04.426
What do you want me to say?

98
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:06.928
Bury it.

99
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.889
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

100
00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:12.058
And cut the bullshit.

101
00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.229
Go on. pussy.

102
00:07:18.022 --> 00:07:20.609
- [Steve] And that's what they did.
- [men chattering in Spanish]

103
00:07:20.692 --> 00:07:22.860
They buried it in fields...

104
00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:28.408
they hid it in caletas.
hiding places in walls and ceilings.

105
00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:33.413
They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.

106
00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.501
Hey. Mom.

107
00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:41.630
- I'm praying. Pablo.
- [softly] Just for a second.

108
00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:46.593
Sit.

109
00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:53.475
[Pablo sighs]

110
00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:55.727
It isn't very comfortable. Pablito.

111
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:57.646
I'll buy you another sofa later.

112
00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:00.898
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank. son?

113
00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:02.692
No.

114
00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:05.236
All bankers are bandits.

115
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.822
Really. honey?

116
00:08:08.782 --> 00:08:09.825
[laughing]

117
00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:13.035
[Steve]
Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard."

118
00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:14.954
not because he looked like a pirate.

119
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:18.249
but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

120
00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:23.421
But not even the pirate did the trick.

121
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:25.674
The problem was Colombia itself.

122
00:08:25.757 --> 00:08:28.802
It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.

123
00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:33.973
It was inevitable... someone. somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.

124
00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:37.977
[speaking Spanish]
Forbes Magazine says...

125
00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:41.189
that the narcos have more money

126
00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:44.359
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

127
00:08:44.442 --> 00:08:47.863
- Let me see?
- [men murmuring]

128
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:51.115
If we kidnap someone in their family.
what are they going to do?

129
00:08:51.199 --> 00:08:53.242
- Call the police?
- [laughter]

130
00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:54.160
[woman] Commander.

131
00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:59.749
It says here that Gacha. "The Mexican."
is the ninth richest man in the world.

132
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.751
I say we kidnap his son.

133
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:05.547
- [low murmurs]
- He's a psycho maniac. comrade.

134
00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:09.718
Plus. he's bought off half the military.

135
00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:13.471
Well. the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

136
00:09:13.555 --> 00:09:15.891
Their sister Marta
goes to the university.

137
00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.183
How about her?

138
00:09:18.518 --> 00:09:19.811
[low murmurs]

139
00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:23.732
I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.

140
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:26.275
Wait a second.

141
00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:29.320
What about Pablo Escobar?

142
00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:31.280
[Steve]
I know what you're thinking.

143
00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:34.158
No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers. right?

144
00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:38.872
But if you're thinking that. it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.

145
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.709
- [Latin rock music plays]
- M-19 was a communist guerrilla group

146
00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:45.086
made up of college students
and intellectuals

147
00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:47.630
who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.

148
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.552
Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...

149
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:55.346
a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare.

150
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.724
but understood the power of symbols.

151
00:09:58.808 --> 00:10:00.894
He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum

152
00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:04.981
with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend. Elisa.

153
00:10:05.064 --> 00:10:09.444
and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar.

154
00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:13.406
the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.

155
00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:15.700
[laughing]

156
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:31.925
These jokers even left a note:

157
00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:36.053
"Bolívar. your sword
returns to the battlefield."

158
00:10:36.262 --> 00:10:37.680
[moaning]

159
00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:42.393
It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.

160
00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:44.479
And it made them famous overnight.

161
00:10:46.815 --> 00:10:48.817
And I guess it went to their heads.

162
00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:53.446
[speaks Spanish] What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

163
00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:56.574
Escobar gives money to the poor.

164
00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:59.953
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

165
00:11:00.036 --> 00:11:01.370
He's all right with me.

166
00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:03.080
OK. then.

167
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.542
- Let's do the Ochoas.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.692
- [shouts]
- [tires squealing]

173
00:11:30.775 --> 00:11:35.571
[Steve] March 13th. 1981.
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa.

174
00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:39.200
was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.

175
00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:42.078
[chatter in Spanish]

176
00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:44.956
- Hola.
- [sighs]

177
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.000
[speaks Spanish]
Good afternoon.

178
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.338
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
- [Steve] Sí.

179
00:11:53.798 --> 00:11:55.591
[speaking English]
Does the cat have any papers?

180
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.802
- Sí.
- Please.

181
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.473
Thank you.

182
00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:07.854
Mm.

183
00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:11.024
[sighs]

184
00:12:11.107 --> 00:12:12.859
Excuse me a second. please.

185
00:12:13.068 --> 00:12:15.486
[dialing phone]

186
00:12:17.488 --> 00:12:18.990
[man sighs]

187
00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:27.957
[speaking Spanish]
Sir. this couple has no sanitary B-47 form

188
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:29.792
and no I-435
identifying papers. either.

189
00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:31.920
[softly]
Well. I guess he's talking about Puff.

190
00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:34.881
[man continues in Spanish] Yes. sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

191
00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:41.637
Sure. but without the I-435. I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

192
00:12:43.556 --> 00:12:47.643
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

193
00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:53.190
Sir. I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

194
00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:56.111
OK. sir.

195
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.699
[speaking English]
My boss is not having a good day.

196
00:13:01.783 --> 00:13:03.785
I think his wife left him.
[soft chuckle]

197
00:13:06.412 --> 00:13:12.001
Yeah. well. he's a little bit cranky.
so... how important is this cat to you?

198
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:13.544
Excuse me?

199
00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:15.337
OK.

200
00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:16.422
Come with me. please.

201
00:13:37.652 --> 00:13:39.862
So... wait here. please.

202
00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:43.783
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

203
00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:46.494
How long is it gonna be?

204
00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:47.745
I don't know.

205
00:13:51.332 --> 00:13:53.250
- [chanting] Pablo! Pablo!
- [band plays up-tempo music]

206
00:13:53.334 --> 00:13:55.419
[Steve]
While I was trying to get into Bogotá.

207
00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:58.047
Pablo was trying to get into politics.

208
00:13:58.131 --> 00:14:02.177
When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia. he meant it.

209
00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.013
- [speaking Spanish] Hello. Pablo.
- Hello. Valeria.

210
00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:08.349
- This is my wife. Tata.
- Hello.

211
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:10.643
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

212
00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:13.562
[Pablo] I'm just not used
to these type of things.

213
00:14:13.646 --> 00:14:15.064
Just be yourself.

214
00:14:16.024 --> 00:14:18.275
Ma'am. it would be best
if you weren't here.

215
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.531
Look. Tata.
there are a lot of people here.

216
00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:25.449
It might not be good for the baby.

217
00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.577
Go to the house.

218
00:14:35.126 --> 00:14:36.878
[sighs]

219
00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:41.340
[groans. chuckles dryly]

220
00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.759
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

221
00:14:45.511 --> 00:14:48.681
Maybe he's at "terapia de pareja."

222
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.225
What's that?

223
00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:51.726
Couples counseling.

224
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.311
Right.

225
00:14:55.271 --> 00:14:56.689
What're you doing?

226
00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:58.774
Oh. I'm practicing my Spanish.

227
00:14:58.858 --> 00:15:00.276
[Valeria]
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

228
00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:04.780
I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"

229
00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:07.408
for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.

230
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.618
[Steve]
Yeah. you heard that right.

231
00:15:09.702 --> 00:15:13.455
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.

232
00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:16.292
- [crowd clamoring]
- And in a way. she was right.

233
00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:18.169
When you've run out of ways
to hide your money.

234
00:15:18.253 --> 00:15:20.671
that's when you give it to the poor.

235
00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:22.798
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

236
00:15:23.007 --> 00:15:26.552
[in Spanish] Tell us about your program.
"Medellín Without Slums." Mr. Escobar.

237
00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:29.638
I was born in Rionegro.
not too far from here.

238
00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:34.435
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

239
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:37.313
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

240
00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:40.066
Hospitals. social and athletic programs.

241
00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:43.278
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

242
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.323
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

243
00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:49.325
Do you have any political aspirations.
Mr. Escobar?

244
00:15:49.408 --> 00:15:53.788
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

245
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:55.790
I will tell you one thing. Valeria.

246
00:15:55.873 --> 00:16:02.088
For decades. our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

247
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.924
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

248
00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:09.304
They don't know what
common people dream of. but I do...

249
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.764
- Connie. you know who that is?
- [Pablo continues indistinctly]

250
00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:14.350
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

251
00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:17.061
I can't believe it.

252
00:16:17.937 --> 00:16:20.315
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

253
00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.776
- [Pablo] Thank you very much.
- [crowd chanting] Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

254
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.072
[Steve] At the time.
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

255
00:16:28.823 --> 00:16:31.492
I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

256
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:41.502
[Steve] Well. we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

257
00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:45.798
Uh. my wife's a little exhausted.
so here is the cat's vaccination--

258
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:47.383
Your passport.

259
00:16:48.343 --> 00:16:49.344
I'm sorry?

260
00:16:50.303 --> 00:16:52.221
Your passport. please.

261
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.688
- [Steve sighs]
- Gracias.

262
00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:10.823
[machine whirring]

263
00:17:10.906 --> 00:17:14.994
What do you do at
the United States Embassy. Mr. Murphy?

264
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:17.330
I am in. uh.
janitorial services.

265
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:20.624
Janitorial services.

266
00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:22.251
Another one.

267
00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.838
Your embassy must be very clean.

268
00:17:26.047 --> 00:17:29.675
Oh. yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

269
00:17:31.177 --> 00:17:32.428
Your cat's cleared.

270
00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:36.557
Enjoy Colombia.

271
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:46.692
[Steve] And just like that. the narcos
had me on file the very first day.

272
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:47.985
[fax machine beeps]

273
00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:06.337
[Latin music plays on radio]

274
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:08.339
[Steve]
As for Valeria Velez.

275
00:18:08.423 --> 00:18:12.551
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

276
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:15.054
She was as dangerous as M-19.

277
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:21.894
[grunting]

278
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.232
[moaning]

279
00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.820
[speaking Spanish]
Does your wife do it standing up?

280
00:18:31.904 --> 00:18:36.200
- Aah! [gasps]
- [both panting]

281
00:18:36.284 --> 00:18:40.121
Don't ever disrespect Tata.

282
00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:43.332
- Do you hear me?
- [moans]

283
00:18:46.085 --> 00:18:49.671
I'm sorry. Pablo...
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:52.133 --> 00:18:53.550
Forgive me.

285
00:18:58.347 --> 00:19:00.182
It won't happen again.

286
00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:01.434
I promise.

287
00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:15.739
How can I apologize? Huh?

288
00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:32.881
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

289
00:19:36.635 --> 00:19:38.220
[Steve]
You gotta give it to her.

290
00:19:38.304 --> 00:19:41.390
- She saw Pablo coming a mile away.
- [gasps]

291
00:19:41.474 --> 00:19:45.644
And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

292
00:19:47.104 --> 00:19:49.690
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña.

293
00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.568
who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

294
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.862
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

295
00:19:57.156 --> 00:19:59.700
- [grunting]
- [moans]

296
00:20:10.545 --> 00:20:12.547
[both panting]

297
00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.978
[speaking Spanish]
We get better every time we practice.

298
00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:30.064
You're amazing. Javier.

299
00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:33.942
Well...

300
00:20:37.488 --> 00:20:39.156
don't go overboard.

301
00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:46.914
It's the truth.

302
00:20:48.457 --> 00:20:50.292
What can you offer me to drink?

303
00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:52.628
Whiskey or tap water.

304
00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:55.339
Water.

305
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.727
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

306
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.687
It's fine the way it is.

307
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:14.942
Well. I wasn't offering.

308
00:21:23.367 --> 00:21:24.619
Here.

309
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.875
If you were a client.
you would have paid me already.

310
00:21:35.421 --> 00:21:38.340
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

311
00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:42.470
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

312
00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:47.057
Take it.

313
00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.145
And my visa?

314
00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:55.316
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

315
00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:03.365
What are you doing this weekend?

316
00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:06.535
- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?

317
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:09.330
I have to take care of my child.

318
00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.915
I can pay. too.

319
00:22:15.503 --> 00:22:17.963
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam. Javi.

320
00:22:21.634 --> 00:22:22.759
Come here.

321
00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:27.556
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

322
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.100
Give me a kiss.

323
00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:43.614
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

324
00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:47.451
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

325
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.620
Some of us are even going by plane.

326
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.500
Helena?

327
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:56.001
Helena.

328
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:01.382
Whose party is it?

329
00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:06.345
[panting]

330
00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:10.974
- [gunfire in distance]
- [Connie] Oh. God! What was that?

331
00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:12.184
[Steve] That was like a .38.

332
00:23:12.267 --> 00:23:14.228
- About four blocks away.
- Oh... [laughs]

333
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:21.736
- [automatic gunfire outside]
- [Connie gasps]

334
00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:27.157
[car alarm wailing]

335
00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:33.872
- Welcome to Bogotá.
- [Connie panting]

336
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:36.751
- Should we do it under the bed?
- [laughs]

337
00:24:00.357 --> 00:24:04.861
[speaking Spanish] Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

338
00:24:07.114 --> 00:24:08.949
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

339
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:23.297
[man 1 in Spanish] Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.

340
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.632
Gustavo. too.

341
00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:29.511
- [man 2] And Jorge?
- [man 1] No. Jorge doesn't agree.

342
00:24:29.595 --> 00:24:33.014
- [man 2] Then what?
- [man 1] They're all going to a meeting.

343
00:24:33.098 --> 00:24:35.100
At Las Margaritas.

344
00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:37.853
- [man 2] Everyone?
- [man 1] Yeah. they'll all be there.

345
00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:39.313
[recording stops]

346
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:49.615
[Steve]
First day at the American Embassy.

347
00:24:49.698 --> 00:24:52.242
- I met my partner...
- Javier?

348
00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:54.536
...who introduced me to the DEA.

349
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.330
[Javier]
Murphy. this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

350
00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:58.373
These guys are R.I.P.
"Retired in Place."

351
00:24:58.457 --> 00:25:00.375
- Eat me. Peña.
- Paid vacation's over. fellas.

352
00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:01.710
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

353
00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:04.797
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

354
00:25:06.507 --> 00:25:08.342
We are going to Medellín?

355
00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:12.554
- [Steve] Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

356
00:25:12.638 --> 00:25:14.014
Murphy. this is Mil Group.

357
00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:17.601
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

358
00:25:17.685 --> 00:25:19.060
Hey. those are classified.

359
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:22.272
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

360
00:25:22.356 --> 00:25:23.858
No problem.

361
00:25:27.277 --> 00:25:30.823
[Steve] And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.

362
00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:32.199
Why do you need this intel?

363
00:25:33.325 --> 00:25:36.244
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

364
00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:37.996
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

365
00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:40.248
First class airfare.
five-star hotels.

366
00:25:40.457 --> 00:25:42.501
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

367
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.961
What does the M-19
have to do with this?

368
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.923
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

369
00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:50.926
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

370
00:25:51.677 --> 00:25:55.305
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

371
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:58.809
went to any of those hookers.
it'll be your ass.

372
00:25:59.017 --> 00:26:01.019
OK. thank you.
One last thing. Ambassador.

373
00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:02.312
Yes. Agent Peña?

374
00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:05.106
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

375
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:06.859
You're bothering me.

376
00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:10.905
She sure likes you.

377
00:26:10.987 --> 00:26:12.740
Is your informant really a prostitute?

378
00:26:12.823 --> 00:26:14.616
Everybody works for somebody.

379
00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:25.460
[Steve] The very next day.
I was flying with Peña to Medellín.

380
00:26:25.544 --> 00:26:27.295
Pablo's home turf.

381
00:26:34.302 --> 00:26:39.683
First stop: Carlos Holguín School.
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

382
00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:52.947
- [speaking Spanish] Good day. Major.
- Good day.

383
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:57.952
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

384
00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:01.872
[speaking English] I want you
to meet our new DEA. Steve Murphy.

385
00:27:01.956 --> 00:27:03.582
[speaking Spanish]
Fresh meat.

386
00:27:06.752 --> 00:27:10.965
[Steve] Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

387
00:27:13.884 --> 00:27:17.679
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

388
00:27:20.682 --> 00:27:23.143
- There was Carlos Lehder...
- [camera shutter clicks]

389
00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:28.774
- [shutter clicks]
- ...the Ochoa brothers...

390
00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:36.740
Fernando Galeano.
"the Wolfman"...

391
00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:49.962
Is that Gacha?

392
00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:53.423
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

393
00:27:55.634 --> 00:28:00.096
[Steve] And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

394
00:28:01.932 --> 00:28:04.018
Get pictures of that fucker.

395
00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:07.395
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

396
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:12.776
[Steve] They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.

397
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.153
[shutter clicks]

398
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.076
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

399
00:28:21.159 --> 00:28:23.244
of the famed Medellín cartel.

400
00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:27.123
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa

401
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:30.585
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

402
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.715
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

403
00:28:36.842 --> 00:28:39.887
[speaking Spanish]
What I propose at this moment. gentlemen.

404
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.849
is that we form an organization.

405
00:28:43.932 --> 00:28:50.939
Pool our resources to train soldiers.
trade knowledge and buy information.

406
00:28:51.773 --> 00:28:57.071
And so the message is clear.
we're going to name our group

407
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:59.406
"Death to Kidnappers."

408
00:28:59.489 --> 00:29:01.491
[appreciative murmurs]

409
00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:03.243
What I propose:

410
00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:07.081
I will manage all operational aspects.

411
00:29:07.163 --> 00:29:09.750
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

412
00:29:11.126 --> 00:29:15.797
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.

413
00:29:15.881 --> 00:29:18.926
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

414
00:29:19.843 --> 00:29:23.471
Two... and at this moment.
the most important...

415
00:29:24.598 --> 00:29:28.769
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

416
00:29:28.977 --> 00:29:31.438
- [overlapping murmurs]
- [man] Salud.

417
00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:35.025
[all] Death to Kidnappers!

418
00:29:39.237 --> 00:29:40.614
[up-tempo music playing]

419
00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:43.491
[Steve] We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

420
00:29:44.743 --> 00:29:46.912
Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

421
00:29:46.995 --> 00:29:48.914
right into the heart of the action.

422
00:29:50.415 --> 00:29:53.794
[man speaking Spanish]
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

423
00:29:53.877 --> 00:29:56.838
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him. too.

424
00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:03.553
Sit down. my love.

425
00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:08.850
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

426
00:30:08.934 --> 00:30:10.894
I like your hat.

427
00:30:10.978 --> 00:30:12.813
It looks good on you.

428
00:30:13.647 --> 00:30:15.315
- Do you think so?
- Yes. it looks good.

429
00:30:15.398 --> 00:30:16.650
Let's see.

430
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.403
- Very cute.
- [indistinct chatter]

431
00:30:27.035 --> 00:30:28.829
[speaking English]
She should be here by now.

432
00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:31.331
You think she slipped?

433
00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.500
Nah. she's no dummy.

434
00:30:37.671 --> 00:30:39.923
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

435
00:30:40.007 --> 00:30:41.216
Yeah.

436
00:30:43.844 --> 00:30:45.762
[Gacha grunting]

437
00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:57.649
Aah... [groans]

438
00:30:59.193 --> 00:31:01.153
[Steve]
Helena wanted a US visa so bad.

439
00:31:01.236 --> 00:31:04.072
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

440
00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:06.992
And that was a problem.

441
00:31:08.243 --> 00:31:11.538
- [speaking Spanish] You're tired.
- Hm?

442
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.582
Let me relax you a bit.

443
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.383
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

444
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:30.765
What did you hear?

445
00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:33.143
Nothing.
Just making conversation.

446
00:31:39.774 --> 00:31:42.652
[Carrillo speaking English] They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

447
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:47.115
- She's already dead.
- No. they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

448
00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:48.909
Then they killed her somewhere else.

449
00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:50.785
She knew the risks.

450
00:31:50.869 --> 00:31:52.829
If we're going back.
we go back now.

451
00:31:55.916 --> 00:31:57.667
[speaking Spanish]
I want you to find the girl.

452
00:31:59.211 --> 00:32:01.421
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

453
00:32:01.504 --> 00:32:03.506
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

454
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.926
[in English] Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up. OK?

455
00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:08.845
- Yeah. and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

456
00:32:08.929 --> 00:32:10.430
[speaking Spanish]
That's it. guys.

457
00:32:19.273 --> 00:32:23.359
- [men chattering in Spanish. laughing]
- [breath trembling]

458
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.698
- Guys.
- Hey. what happened?

459
00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:31.034
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

460
00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:32.493
What. did you kill her?

461
00:32:32.702 --> 00:32:34.871
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

462
00:32:41.502 --> 00:32:43.463
[man] It's my turn now.

463
00:32:58.478 --> 00:33:00.147
[gasps]

464
00:33:01.397 --> 00:33:03.984
- [speaking Spanish] Where's the girl?
- [panting]

465
00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:06.987
- Where's the girl. asshole?
- [whispers] I don't know.

466
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.614
[panting] I don't know.

467
00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:12.159
[Carrillo] Choke him.

468
00:33:12.242 --> 00:33:13.701
[grunting]

469
00:33:15.245 --> 00:33:20.500
- [men speaking Spanish. laughing]
- [door opens. closes]

470
00:33:22.085 --> 00:33:25.088
- [overlapping chatter]
- Enough with the party.

471
00:33:25.172 --> 00:33:26.673
[all groaning]

472
00:33:26.756 --> 00:33:29.384
I gotta rough this girl up.

473
00:33:29.467 --> 00:33:31.594
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

474
00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:34.181
Gacha's paranoid.

475
00:33:35.556 --> 00:33:39.894
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

476
00:33:39.978 --> 00:33:42.356
Let me have a little more fun.
then I'll let her go.

477
00:33:42.438 --> 00:33:44.899
- It's all right. boys.
- [men chuckling. chattering]

478
00:33:44.983 --> 00:33:46.401
This one's for all of you!

479
00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:49.863
- [man] Slap her around!
- [breath trembling]

480
00:33:50.822 --> 00:33:52.407
[indistinct radio chatter]

481
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.619
- [low conversations in Spanish]
- [bell tolling]

482
00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:05.962
Any news on the radio?

483
00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:09.590
- [speaking Spanish] Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

484
00:34:09.674 --> 00:34:11.634
Sorry. I don't speak English.

485
00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:14.054
[Steve scoffs]

486
00:34:15.513 --> 00:34:16.848
[sighs]

487
00:34:22.687 --> 00:34:25.481
- [speaking Spanish] How far is it?
- [man] Come on. you piece of shit.

488
00:34:27.317 --> 00:34:28.193
[grunts]

489
00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:32.239
[men chattering in Spanish]

490
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.001
[soft grunt]

491
00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:47.003
[cocks pistol]

492
00:35:00.767 --> 00:35:03.311
[chatter. laughter continues]

493
00:35:07.648 --> 00:35:10.193
- [gunshots]
- [overlapping shouts]

494
00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:18.826
[soft whimper]

495
00:35:21.204 --> 00:35:23.123
Helena?

496
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:31.631
[speaking Spanish] I'm going to get you
out of here. OK? I promise.

497
00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:36.803
[whimpering sobs]

498
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:51.234
All right. She's coming out.

499
00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:57.532
[speaking Spanish] Copy. Major.

500
00:35:57.615 --> 00:35:58.699
Let's go. boys.

501
00:36:00.327 --> 00:36:02.745
[in English] Hey. gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

502
00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:06.541
- No habla inglés. huh?
- [engine starts]

503
00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:08.293
¡Vamos!

504
00:36:16.592 --> 00:36:18.386
Where the fuck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?

505
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.720
[speaking Spanish]
Over there.

506
00:36:22.265 --> 00:36:24.600
[low chatter in Spanish]

507
00:36:36.363 --> 00:36:39.657
- [speaking English] How is she?
- Sedated.

508
00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:44.329
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically. yeah.

509
00:36:44.412 --> 00:36:46.581
Mentally. I haven't got a fucking clue.

510
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.251
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look. man--

511
00:36:50.335 --> 00:36:52.628
If we're gonna be partners.
I don't get left behind.

512
00:36:52.712 --> 00:36:56.299
I didn't come all the way down here. Peña.
to sit on the fucking sidelines.

513
00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:05.141
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

514
00:37:05.225 --> 00:37:06.851
Is that understood?

515
00:37:11.939 --> 00:37:13.191
Understood.

516
00:37:17.445 --> 00:37:19.239
I hope you know what that means.

517
00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:31.000
[Steve] Pablo's message
to the kidnappers was simple.

518
00:37:31.084 --> 00:37:36.047
He was going to kill them. one by one.
until he got Marta Ochoa back.

519
00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:40.051
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.

520
00:37:40.134 --> 00:37:43.137
Sooner or later.
he figured the narcos would cave in.

521
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:45.681
Big mistake.

522
00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:48.142
M-19 didn't stand a chance.

523
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:02.490
[speaking Spanish] "Deliver Marta Ochoa
safe and sound... or your family is next."

524
00:38:03.617 --> 00:38:05.535
Signed. "Death to Kidnappers."

525
00:38:06.786 --> 00:38:07.703
[retches]

526
00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:12.041
[tires screech]

527
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:13.918
[Marta whimpering]
Please! Please. let me go.

528
00:38:14.127 --> 00:38:16.504
- [man] Hurry up!
- Please. don't!

529
00:38:16.588 --> 00:38:20.467
[Steve] Needless to say.
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.

530
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.393
And the killing didn't stop.

531
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:34.897
Pablo had tasted blood.
and he liked it.

532
00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:38.568
[speaking Spanish]
Tell him to get a little closer.

533
00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:41.321
A little closer. A little closer!

534
00:38:41.404 --> 00:38:44.157
You know what. boss?
Go a little higher.

535
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.326
A little bit higher
and a little bit closer

536
00:38:46.409 --> 00:38:48.328
so you can see the tree!

537
00:38:49.579 --> 00:38:50.913
That's it.

538
00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:57.086
Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

539
00:38:58.212 --> 00:38:59.673
That...

540
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.257
That's it. Perfect.

541
00:39:01.341 --> 00:39:02.509
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

542
00:39:02.592 --> 00:39:04.177
A little more.

543
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.263
That's it! There you go.

544
00:39:08.764 --> 00:39:09.724
[camera shutter clicks]

545
00:39:09.807 --> 00:39:11.934
- [man 1] Much better.
- [man 2] Yes. boss.

546
00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:16.397
[baby crying nearby]

547
00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:22.278
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

548
00:39:22.362 --> 00:39:24.531
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

549
00:39:24.614 --> 00:39:26.574
Stupid asshole.

550
00:39:26.658 --> 00:39:28.409
It's a woman with a baby.

551
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.206
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

552
00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:34.457
Do it.

553
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:36.501
Good day. ma'am.

554
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.796
- Good day.
- I'm sorry. but the park is closed today.

555
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.840
What do you mean the park is closed?

556
00:39:42.923 --> 00:39:45.009
May I escort you out?

557
00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:47.554
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

558
00:39:47.637 --> 00:39:52.808
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

559
00:39:52.892 --> 00:39:55.102
I thought I smelled something.

560
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:56.604
- Right?
- Yes.

561
00:39:56.688 --> 00:39:58.398
Oh. look.
what a beautiful little baby.

562
00:39:58.481 --> 00:40:00.941
Right. just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

563
00:40:01.025 --> 00:40:04.070
- You must be proud.
- Yes. of course.

564
00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:07.240
My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.

565
00:40:07.323 --> 00:40:09.617
Oh. very good.
Congratulations!

566
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:12.579
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
but as long as it's healthy.

567
00:40:12.662 --> 00:40:17.208
Yes. of course.
The most important thing is health.

568
00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:22.296
[Steve] Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers

569
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.132
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.

570
00:40:25.883 --> 00:40:28.428
If he could do this
to the feared communists.

571
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:30.137
he could do it to anyone.

572
00:40:31.598 --> 00:40:34.308
Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...

573
00:40:34.392 --> 00:40:36.477
there was only one thing he could do.

574
00:40:38.813 --> 00:40:40.314
[man speaking Spanish]
Hey. Don Pablo.

575
00:40:41.857 --> 00:40:43.984
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

576
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:48.155
Should I kill him or what?

577
00:40:56.914 --> 00:40:59.250
From what I can see.
you're not going to stop.

578
00:41:00.585 --> 00:41:03.212
Here I am.
so you can finish what you started...

579
00:41:04.922 --> 00:41:07.300
but with the sword of Bolívar.

580
00:41:33.618 --> 00:41:37.330
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

581
00:41:42.126 --> 00:41:43.210
Stand up.

582
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:53.053
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

583
00:41:57.684 --> 00:42:01.187
From now on.
we are going to work together.

584
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:10.363
Go in peace. brother.

585
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.714
Is that what I think it is?

586
00:42:28.756 --> 00:42:30.383
You've gotta be kidding.

587
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.600
I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

588
00:42:41.853 --> 00:42:44.188
And you'll do what?

589
00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:48.568
Liberate Colombia.

590
00:42:56.659 --> 00:42:58.994
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

591
00:43:15.803 --> 00:43:19.891
[Steve] The narcos had their army.
but me and Peña had ours. too.

592
00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:22.685
Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo

593
00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:25.772
were so invested
in the future of their country

594
00:43:25.855 --> 00:43:28.858
that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.

595
00:43:31.068 --> 00:43:35.740
This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.

596
00:43:35.823 --> 00:43:39.535
And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

597
00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:43.957
Even my wife. Connie.
wanted to help.

598
00:43:44.164 --> 00:43:47.460
She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

599
00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:50.212
- She wanted to make a difference.
- [indistinct chatter]

600
00:43:50.296 --> 00:43:52.924
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

601
00:43:53.007 --> 00:43:56.176
Look. our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

602
00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.763
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

603
00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:01.975
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

604
00:44:02.057 --> 00:44:04.226
Well. I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

605
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.394
Hey. stop right here.

606
00:44:08.815 --> 00:44:10.858
[children laughing]

607
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:16.071
Praise God.

608
00:44:25.247 --> 00:44:26.624
[Connie] Perdón.

609
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:33.464
I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

610
00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.884
Hey. did we leave the door open?

611
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.555
[voice trembles]
Oh. my God. Steve!

612
00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:43.641
- Get back.
- [cocks pistol]

613
00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:55.319
You stay right there
and don't move.
