2
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.873
It's…

3
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:24.710
… yeah. This way.

4
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.464
Okay. Okay.

5
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.195
Here we are inside.
something called agri-jet.

6
00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.659
It's a refrigerated warehouse
in. Albuquerque. new Mexico.

7
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:40.767
Jesus.

8
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.289
It's cold in here. …

9
00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:47.709
All right. let me show you around.
I'll give you a sense of the place.

10
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.419
give you the grand tour.

11
00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.171
It's-it's… it's huge.

12
00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:52.946
It's maybe hundred feet long.

13
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:56.009
I don't know what that is
in meters. but it's massive.

14
00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.452
And it is packed to the rafters

15
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:03.248
with lots and lots of…

16
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:05.792
Shrink-wrapped…

17
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.252
Items.

18
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.341
Yeah. so what's inside?

19
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.301
Well…

20
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.447
A picture's worth a
thousand words. right?

21
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.681
So. I'm gonna let you see for yourself.

22
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.537
Okay.

23
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.067
Okay.

24
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.378
Do you see this?

25
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.196
Yeah.

26
00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:39.135
It's… that is not a butterball Turkey.

27
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.494
I'll tell you that much.

28
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.181
What are they doing with all this?

29
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.516
Guess.

30
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.184
Fucking guess.

31
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:52.464
Because this whole place
is filled with human bodies.

32
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.609
It's parts of them!

33
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.778
It's pieces of them.

34
00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:59.638
All vacuum sealed.

35
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:04.476
That is what this whole
plant is being used for.

36
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.498
And it's been happening
right under our noses.

37
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.233
I mean. they got out
of this town in a hurry.

38
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.069
but I guarantee you. before that.

39
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.072
they were probably doing
three shifts a day in here.

40
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.076
And what's behind that door?

41
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:27.559
It is a meat grinder the
size of a bus and vats.

42
00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.394
cooking vats.

43
00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.503
And wait until you
see what's inside those.

44
00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:02.357
Two million. four
hundred thousand even.

45
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.274
All in.

46
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.448
All in.

47
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.310
Five million dollars.

48
00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.336
The house record.

49
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.561
Are you sure?

50
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.453
Please reveal your cards.

51
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.771
A straight flush.

52
00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:14.531
- A royal flush.
- Ooh! Ooh.

53
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.509
The higher hand.

54
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.175
Hey. pal. Stay in character.

55
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:42.059
You may have won
this time. Mr. Diabaté.

56
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.937
But your luck is about to run out.

57
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.707
Someday. perhaps…

58
00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:54.655
…but not today.

59
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.074
For you. my lovely.

60
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.221
It's been an honor.

61
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:11.314
Anyone else?

62
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.637
Come. my beauties.

63
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:28.397
Next time.

64
00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:33.044
It's been a pleasure!

65
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.492
And you are?

66
00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:48.369
- Joette.
- Joette!

67
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.122
Come in. my dear.

68
00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.348
We're terribly sorry. our love.

69
00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:11.124
but we have to leave immediately.

70
00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:13.627
What? Why?

71
00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:16.046
You're going to have a visitor.

72
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:24.721
You can come with us. if you want.

73
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.327
I can't do that to her.

74
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.871
Sooner or later. we'll have to talk.

75
00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.526
Is there no time for even a little…?

76
00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.613
Joette?

77
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.736
Please be here. Please
be here. Please be here.

78
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.596
Please be here. Please be here.

79
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:32.158
Penthouse.

80
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.457
Hello?

81
00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:17.603
In here.

82
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.200
Just in time. Carol.

83
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:36.681
So. on their way out the door.
they told you I was coming?

84
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.792
- Why'd you stay?
- To welcome you.

85
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:43.480
No. thanks.

86
00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.756
I appreciate that.

87
00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:49.176
I bet they didn't tell
you why I was coming.

88
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.553
There's no way in hell they did.

89
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.574
You're gonna need something
stronger than champagne

90
00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:55.974
when you see what I brought.

91
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.685
Do you…

92
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.523
…have a TV in this barn?

93
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.740
Impressive.

94
00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:23.585
Okay.

95
00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.398
What do you got? H… … hdmi. All right.

96
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.818
Is this another one of your videos?

97
00:17:29.842 --> 00:17:30.985
You've seen my videos?

98
00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.156
They actually sent you my videos?

99
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.241
Of course.

100
00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:37.516
They were very well done.

101
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.476
Very dramatic.

102
00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:42.813
Well. you could have…

103
00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.334
Forget it.

104
00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:49.027
When you see this one…

105
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:53.615
let's just say… it's disturbing.

106
00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.636
And. I hate to use a cliché.

107
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.996
but you might want
to sit down. Seriously.

108
00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:01.850
'Cause I am telling you what
you are about to witness...

109
00:18:01.874 --> 00:18:03.584
is this about them eating people?

110
00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:08.255
- What?
- It is troubling.

111
00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.800
Wait. how would you… how could you…

112
00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:13.802
Allow me.

113
00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.742
Hello. Carol. We're John cena.

114
00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.495
and we're here to address some
questions you may be having

115
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:23.854
regarding our food supply.

116
00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.750
As you know. we can't
purposely kill. harm.

117
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.277
or otherwise interfere
with any form of life.

118
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.155
That limits what we're able to consume.

119
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.093
Because when we say "any
life." that includes plant life.

120
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.929
We can't harvest wheat or corn or rice.

121
00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.788
We can't pluck an apple from a tree.

122
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.184
Once an apple drops of its own accord.

123
00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:46.418
well. we'll eat it. of course. and gratefully.

124
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:49.689
Indeed. we harvest all
the windfall we can find.

125
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.965
Plus. there are billions
of domesticated animals.

126
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:55.761
cows. chief amongst them.
that still require milking.

127
00:18:56.345 --> 00:18:59.741
And there's preexisting
food. millions of tons of it.

128
00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:01.767
that was processed prior to our joining.

129
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:03.936
So far. so good. right?

130
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:06.647
Except for one small problem.

131
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:14.154
As of this taping. there
are 7.348.292.411 of us.

132
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.657
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

133
00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:18.951
We're facing a caloric deficit.

134
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.204
and to make up for it. we've
had to take certain measures.

135
00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:26.184
This is how we get our sustenance.

136
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:30.003
One half-pint of this shelf-stable
liquid contains 300 calories.

137
00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:34.067
Which means that based on
a diet of 2.400 calories a day.

138
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:38.488
someone John cena's size
needs eight of these every 24 hours.

139
00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:42.015
Larger individuals require
more. Smaller ones. less.

140
00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:44.035
What's in it?

141
00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:45.620
Well. a lot of things.

142
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:47.497
It's manufactured across the globe.

143
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:51.191
so the recipe changes based on
the local availability of ingredients.

144
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:55.004
Mostly. it's those stockpiled
foodstuffs we spoke of.

145
00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.447
particularly ones that
are in danger of spoiling.

146
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.386
Additionally. each carton
contains eight to 12%

147
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.161
of something we call hdp.

148
00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.265
Human-derived protein.

149
00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:07.583
And yep. that's pretty
much what it sounds like.

150
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:13.398
Nearly 100.000 people pass away each
day due to natural causes and accidents.

151
00:20:13.422 --> 00:20:16.067
Those human remains. which
would otherwise go to waste.

152
00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:17.843
are our source of hdp.

153
00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.431
We Cherish the memory of these
people and appreciate their sacrifice.

154
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:26.101
Given our druthers. would
we choose to consume hdp?

155
00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:28.079
No.

156
00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:30.790
Throughout history. most
cultures. though not all.

157
00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:32.900
have taken a dim view of anthropophagy.

158
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.445
Honestly. we're not
that keen on it ourselves.

159
00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.864
But we're left with little choice.

160
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.760
Rest assured. Carol. you will
never have to consume this product.

161
00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:46.181
Not unless you want to.
which we assume is unlikely.

162
00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:50.268
We will never serve hdp to
you in any form at any time.

163
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:52.520
We will continue to
reserve only the freshest.

164
00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.130
best windfall and
stockpiled foods for you.

165
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.901
We hope that clears things up.

166
00:20:57.925 --> 00:21:01.720
As always. your well-being is
of the utmost importance to us.

167
00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:06.350
Any comments. concerns. call any
time. day or night. and leave a voicemail.

168
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.746
We regret not being able
to speak to you directly.

169
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.189
but for the time being.
we need our space.

170
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.031
So you knew all about this?

171
00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:25.303
How… when… for how long?

172
00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:28.956
About a week ago. out of
curiosity. I asked John cena.

173
00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:31.667
"why do you people drink so much milk?"

174
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:33.627
We had been hanging out together.

175
00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.755
He was teaching me the
sunset flip power bomb.

176
00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:39.442
And what was your reaction?

177
00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.777
Do-do you even have one?

178
00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:42.469
As I said. it is troubling.

179
00:21:43.637 --> 00:21:44.888
Very much so.

180
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:47.975
It probably helps that I've
had time to think about it.

181
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.996
I must say John cena makes
a fairly reasonable case.

182
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.790
In French. he's even more convincing.

183
00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:56.817
That is not John cena.

184
00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:00.547
Jesus Christ. why are you so…

185
00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:06.219
How about the fact that in Spain
they all said they were vegetarians?

186
00:22:06.243 --> 00:22:08.245
Yes. I asked John about that.

187
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.807
He reminded me that
technically what they said was

188
00:22:10.831 --> 00:22:13.476
that they would prefer to be vegetarian.

189
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.688
Great. so all the fucking
lawyers in the world survived.

190
00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.148
Carol. for the record.

191
00:22:18.172 --> 00:22:22.235
I am in no way pleased with the idea
of these people eating human flesh.

192
00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:23.862
None of us are.

193
00:22:23.886 --> 00:22:24.887
Us?

194
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:27.723
Who's us?

195
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:33.663
The other individuals.

196
00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:36.899
The ones like you and me.

197
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.443
We stay in touch.

198
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.256
You stay in touch?

199
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.175
All 12 of you?

200
00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:47.594
All but one. There's a
gentleman in Paraguay.

201
00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:50.621
Chaperones reach
out. but he doesn't reply.

202
00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:54.601
But the other 11 of us. yes.

203
00:22:54.625 --> 00:22:56.293
So the 11 of you. you…

204
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:00.047
What? You just hang out?

205
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.568
Potluck suppers and whatnot.

206
00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:05.278
- We meet occasionally.
- Okay.

207
00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.155
Tuesdays and Fridays.

208
00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:08.698
Well. that's a lot of flying.

209
00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:10.200
Mostly. we're on zoom.

210
00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:13.852
Right.

211
00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:16.188
What do you guys talk about?

212
00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:20.126
I mean. it can't be saving the world
'cause you shot that down really quickly.

213
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.086
In a sense it is.

214
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:27.783
Carol. what John cena did not
mention is that even with the hdp.

215
00:23:28.784 --> 00:23:32.847
most of the world's population will
starve to death within the next ten years.

216
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:34.623
- Says who?
- Says them.

217
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.376
If you press them long enough.

218
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:40.587
We wish to save them from that.

219
00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:44.424
At our most recent gathering. we
pitched the idea of robotic farming.

220
00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:48.404
However. as it is. they would have
to build and program the robots.

221
00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:51.658
They did appreciate the input.

222
00:23:51.682 --> 00:23:53.100
I bet.

223
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:58.313
Did you guys ever talk about
including me in the zooms?

224
00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:00.607
I mean…

225
00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:04.796
I am a professional
writer. and no offense.

226
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.656
but I can come up with
shit like robots all day long.

227
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.491
We…

228
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:11.618
We took a vote.

229
00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:13.763
It was not unanimous.

230
00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:17.541
but the majority felt your
presence might prove…

231
00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.169
Disruptive.

232
00:24:23.172 --> 00:24:25.733
Also. our non-English speakers
were perhaps a bit offended that

233
00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:28.218
you did not invite
them to join us in Spain.

234
00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.990
I'm sorry. Carol.

235
00:24:32.014 --> 00:24:34.433
Ultimately this is not about you.

236
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.579
Or any of us. for that matter.

237
00:24:37.603 --> 00:24:38.937
Yeah. sure. I get it.

238
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:43.942
Where's your nearest bathroom?

239
00:25:22.147 --> 00:25:25.234
But she's so lonely.

240
00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:29.112
Yes. I know.

241
00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:31.782
Okay.

242
00:25:36.578 --> 00:25:39.164
I miss you too. my loves.

243
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.685
See you soon.

244
00:27:15.052 --> 00:27:17.137
You're awake.

245
00:27:17.763 --> 00:27:20.933
Once again. your timing is perfect.

246
00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:22.893
Please. sit.

247
00:27:38.951 --> 00:27:40.953
That looks good. Thanks.

248
00:28:49.354 --> 00:28:50.355
So…

249
00:28:51.315 --> 00:28:52.834
What are your plans?

250
00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:56.671
Well. I'm sure you
need a break from me.

251
00:28:59.698 --> 00:29:01.843
I have enjoyed your company. Carol.

252
00:29:01.867 --> 00:29:03.678
- You like your space. I get it.
- No.

253
00:29:03.702 --> 00:29:07.932
So. I was thinking I'll
go find my own suite.

254
00:29:07.956 --> 00:29:09.791
get cleaned up. and then.

255
00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:12.169
we can get together later.

256
00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:13.962
Talk some more.

257
00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:28.161
I'm just messing with you.

258
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:35.376
Well done.

259
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.986
Truth is. I can't get out
of Vegas fast enough.

260
00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:42.699
This city is like a trillion
dollar light-up ashtray.

261
00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.387
No offense to your new town.

262
00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:48.163
No. none taken.

263
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.582
I'm sure it's no Albuquerque.

264
00:29:54.336 --> 00:29:56.397
Carol. you can always call me.

265
00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:59.007
Dial zero. and they will
find me wherever I am.

266
00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:00.926
Thanks.

267
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:02.719
How you say.

268
00:30:03.303 --> 00:30:05.198
"check in" now and then?

269
00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:06.390
Sure.

270
00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:11.478
Maybe you will have some ideas on
how to save these people from starvation.

271
00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:14.523
I don't know.

272
00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:17.484
Maybe tell 'em to pick a fucking apple.

273
00:30:18.402 --> 00:30:20.153
- Wow.
- Sorry.

274
00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:21.864
I didn't mean that.

275
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:24.700
I mean. fuck it. yes. I did.

276
00:30:25.284 --> 00:30:26.535
I meant that. but…

277
00:30:27.744 --> 00:30:28.912
Not like it sounded.

278
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.624
I'm not some kind of monster. you know?

279
00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:34.251
I just…

280
00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:36.396
They're doing this to themselves.

281
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.481
They are choosing to starve.

282
00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:40.817
- They do not see it that way.
- Listen to me.

283
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:45.155
The only way to save these lunatics
is to turn them back the way they were.

284
00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:48.449
There is a way to reverse this.

285
00:30:48.473 --> 00:30:49.975
Help me find it.

286
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:53.663
Do you seriously think the
world is a better place now.

287
00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:55.105
just because it's peaceful?

288
00:30:57.316 --> 00:31:01.129
Well. once they turn us. we're
gonna starve right along with them.

289
00:31:01.153 --> 00:31:02.738
Have you thought of that?

290
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:05.616
They cannot turn us.

291
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:08.493
not without our consent.

292
00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:13.749
What do you mean?

293
00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:16.603
It seems the only way to
make their virus work on us

294
00:31:16.627 --> 00:31:19.939
is by tailoring it to our
individual stem cells.

295
00:31:19.963 --> 00:31:23.693
But to obtain those stem cells. they
must first collect them from our bodies.

296
00:31:23.717 --> 00:31:25.945
What… what?

297
00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:29.973
Apparently that involves sticking a
large needle into the bone of the hip.

298
00:31:30.807 --> 00:31:32.368
Somewhat painful.

299
00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:33.685
And very invasive.

300
00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:38.440
Something they cannot
do without our permission.

301
00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.402
When did you find this out?

302
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.072
They made this discovery only yesterday.

303
00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:48.242
They are not pleased
about it. I can assure you.

304
00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:52.120
They asked me if I
would give my consent.

305
00:31:53.163 --> 00:31:54.331
I said.

306
00:31:55.123 --> 00:31:58.877
"regrettably. as of this
time. I prefer not to."

307
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:13.660
Hello. Carol.

308
00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:14.935
This is a recording.

309
00:32:15.644 --> 00:32:19.958
At the tone. you can leave a message
to request anything you might need.

310
00:32:19.982 --> 00:32:21.650
We'll do our best to provide it.

311
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.987
Our feelings for you
haven't changed. Carol.

312
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:29.408
But after everything that's
happened. we just need a little space.

313
00:32:32.369 --> 00:32:33.453
It's me.

314
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:38.977
Is it true that you need our
stem cells to turn us into you?

315
00:32:39.001 --> 00:32:42.397
And furthermore. is it true that
you need our express permission

316
00:32:42.421 --> 00:32:44.923
to collect those stem cells?

317
00:32:57.436 --> 00:32:58.520
Carol.

318
00:33:25.672 --> 00:33:27.317
Hello. Carol.

319
00:33:27.341 --> 00:33:28.509
This is a recording.

320
00:33:29.259 --> 00:33:33.490
At the tone. you can leave a message
to request anything you might need.

321
00:33:33.514 --> 00:33:35.307
We'll do our best to provide it.

322
00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:38.953
Our feelings for you
haven't changed. Carol.

323
00:33:38.977 --> 00:33:42.832
But after everything that's
happened. we just need a little space.

324
00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:50.590
I am officially going on
record that I do not consent.

325
00:33:50.614 --> 00:33:52.783
You will not lay a finger on me.

326
00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:55.369
Repeat that back.

327
00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:38.387
This is your vehicle?

328
00:34:38.411 --> 00:34:39.413
Yep.

329
00:34:42.748 --> 00:34:44.168
Interesting choice.

330
00:34:47.462 --> 00:34:48.463
You too.

331
00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:11.236
For what it's worth. the
world is doing the best it can.

332
00:35:11.987 --> 00:35:13.071
It misses you.

333
00:35:13.697 --> 00:35:15.199
Zosia misses you.

334
00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:17.201
They want to come back. Carol.

335
00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:20.913
They're just looking
for a change of heart.

336
00:35:22.372 --> 00:35:23.373
Fuck 'em.

337
00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:26.710
Watch your toes.

338
00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:01.628
To my 12 fellow survivors… twelve?

339
00:40:01.652 --> 00:40:03.654
…greetings. I'm Carol sturka.

340
00:40:04.446 --> 00:40:05.798
Some of you know me.

341
00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:07.324
Some of you I've yet to meet.

342
00:40:07.824 --> 00:40:11.245
But… if you're still one of us.

343
00:40:12.454 --> 00:40:13.956
then this message is for you.

344
00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:19.461
There is a way to undo this situation.

345
00:40:20.212 --> 00:40:23.632
To turn the world back
the way it's supposed to be.

346
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.654
How do I know this?

347
00:40:27.678 --> 00:40:33.743
Because earlier today. these
afflicted people. these others.

348
00:40:33.767 --> 00:40:35.435
they basically told me so themselves.

349
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.396
Because guess what?

350
00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:40.107
They can't lie.

351
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:43.586
Which is yet another
thing I've discovered.

352
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.215
This alien virus or whatever it is.

353
00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:50.576
it doesn't allow them to do that.

354
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.831
So. what is this solution exactly?

355
00:40:56.707 --> 00:40:58.184
That they didn't tell me.

356
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:01.461
But-but they so resisted telling me.

357
00:41:02.254 --> 00:41:04.798
that everybody suddenly burst into tears.

358
00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:08.177
Worldwide. apparently.

359
00:41:08.802 --> 00:41:10.637
Which I know upset at least one of you.

360
00:41:11.346 --> 00:41:12.991
And then after that.

361
00:41:13.015 --> 00:41:16.435
they completely
abandoned the city I live in.

362
00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:19.771
Leaving me here all alone.

363
00:41:20.355 --> 00:41:22.774
Which says to me I'm on the right track.

364
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:28.197
Now. I realize some of you

365
00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:31.575
think the world might
be better off this way.

366
00:41:32.451 --> 00:41:35.454
with all the newfound peace.
love and understanding.

367
00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:37.915
Enjoy that opinion.

368
00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:40.417
Relish it.

369
00:41:41.084 --> 00:41:43.504
Because it may be the
last one you ever possess.

370
00:41:44.129 --> 00:41:48.526
And when the day comes that you
have peace and love forced upon you.

371
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:51.220
who knows. maybe in
that last fleeting moment.

372
00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:56.141
you might just realize you
treasure your individuality.

373
00:43:32.112 --> 00:43:34.781
If there is someone here. I
advise you to get out now.

374
00:46:33.168 --> 00:46:34.711
Hello. son.

375
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:44.471
We're happy to see you.

376
00:46:47.683 --> 00:46:50.811
You must be hungry and confused.

377
00:46:54.565 --> 00:46:56.984
Can we answer any questions?

378
00:47:05.993 --> 00:47:09.496
Tell us. What can we do for you. son?

379
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.002
Don't call me son. You're not my mother.

380
00:47:20.048 --> 00:47:22.092
My mother's a bitch.

380
00:47:23.305 --> 00:48:23.511
