He doesn't follow anyone.

200
00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.947

None of it can leave the room.

The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

- to run coke all overthe place.
- Ellis McPickle?

[Steve]
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

Take 'em.

363
00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:08.647

- Just stuff'em down your pants.

- [Whispers] Because they'll suspect me.

- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

368
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.394
They're not gonna
search a white boy. OK?

369
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:25.731
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

370

Just do it.

371
00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.536
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

372
00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:34.675
- [Steve] <i>And sometimes. bad people...</i>
- <i>Senor.</i>

374

[Javier in Spanish] These are

A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

376
00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:46.288
Yes.

377
00:23:47.358 --> 00:23:51.420
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

378
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:53.019
Obviously. it's an alias.

379
00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:57.034
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle." [soft chuckle]

380
00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.365
Because he's not Colombian.

381
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:04.941
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

382
00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:06.772
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

383
00:24:07.645 --> 00:24:10.944
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

384
00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:15.577
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

385
00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:20.717
Suarez. do you ever worry
what will happen to you

386
00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:24.092
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

387
00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.792
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

388
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.491
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

389
00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:33.298
[Sighs]

390
00:24:33.404 --> 00:24:37.397
We have his photograph
in some of ourfiles.

391
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:41.344
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

[Chats indistinctly in Spanish. chuckles]

393

This is me giving you homework.

395
00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:53.987
Former CIA pilot
flying coke forthe narcos.

396
00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:55.819
And I need you to find out who it is.

397
00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:58.791
First off. I don't fucking work for you.
Murphy. you hear me?

398
00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.765
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

399
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.304
What's he up to these days?

400
00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:07.669
Barry Seal.

401
00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:18.045
[Steve] <i>Barry Seal. a good ol'</i>

404

- Or should we say McPickle?

Come on. we got you a ride
waiting over here.

416
00:25:59.657 --> 00:26:01.318

417
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.025
[In English] It's fun to say. though.
ain't it? "McPickle"?

418

[Javier clears throat]

419

Have a seat. Barry.

420
00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:20.171

- Well. you guys ain't got shit.
- [Javier chuckles]

422
00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:27.780
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

423
00:26:27.885 --> 00:26:29.876
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

424
00:26:29.954 --> 00:26:34.688
Yeah? Well. let's see
if that holds up in court. huh?

425
00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:38.453
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

426
00:26:38.564 --> 00:26:40.259
without making a refueling stop.

427
00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:43.697
Yeah. according to the records.
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

428
00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:46.298
The manifests don't lie.

429
00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:50.535
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with orwithout cocaine.

430
00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:54.271
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department. wouldn't it?

431
00:26:54.378 --> 00:26:58.247
Well. damn... [chuckles]
You guys are good.

432

We're gonna wrap you up
in a big. red bow

434

and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

435
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:06.212
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments.

436
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.816
that's treason and trafficking.

437
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.290
What's that.
two life sentences forthe price of one?

438
00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:13.489
[Javier] That's right.

439
00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:20.628
Well... see.
lfigured this day might come.

440
00:27:20.838 --> 00:27:23.773
Why don't you uncuff me. boys.
I got something to show you.

441
00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:24.968
Yeah? What's that?

442
00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:27.772
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

443
00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:31.247
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on. uncuff me.

- [Steve] <i>It was too good.</i>

452
00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:58.038
- Gotta turn this overto the ambassador.
- Wait. wait. wait. No.

453
00:27:58.143 --> 00:28:00.873
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

454
00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:04.436
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's <i>trafficked</i> over 500 tons?

455
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.676
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

456
00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:10.221
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

457
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.551
- You know. I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

458
00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:16.150
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

Strange bedfellows. indeed.

466
00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:50.825

exposed a narco-communist connection.

468
00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.492
Thank you. Ambassador.

469
00:28:56.934 --> 00:28:59.903
This has to be highly classified
forthe safety of the informant.

470
00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:01.096
Of course.

- You're responsible for his death.

[Duque in Spanish]
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

525
00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:32.240
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

526
00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:35.980
against the legality of extradition.

527
00:32:36.086 --> 00:32:40.990
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

528
00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.652
Can we buy someone in that court?

529
00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.822
Unfortunately. no.

530
00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:50.390
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

531

Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in ourfavor.

Brother... even after he's dead.

533

Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

He's totally fucked.
