2
00:01:47.582 --> 00:01:49.669
Move! Move!

3
00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:29.528
Hands! Let me see your hands!

4
00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:57.022
- Jesus Christ. that's Hermann Göring.
- Who?

5
00:02:57.023 --> 00:03:00.921
Hitler's second-in-command.
With fear and waiting.

6
00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:14.056
What did he say?

7
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.460
He asked us to get his luggage.

8
00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:39.372
Justice Jackson?

9
00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:44.224
That depends on if you have a good reason
to be banging on my door at three o'clock.

10
00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:45.963
They captured Hermann Göring alive.

11
00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:50.162
- Where?
- Austria.

12
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:53.716
What are they going to do with him?

13
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.020
Well. that's the real question. isn't it?
Can I come in?

14
00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.959
- No.
- But it's raining.

15
00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.698
I can see that.
Are they going to shoot him?

16
00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:02.037
Not that I know of.

17
00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:05.336
Well. for a long time they
were going to shoot him.

18
00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:05.896
Yes. sir.

19
00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:08.195
Churchill and Roosevelt
signed the order themselves.

20
00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:09.374
On order that you oppose.

21
00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:13.713
I'm a Supreme Court Justice. I tend to
frown on executing men without a trial.

22
00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.432
That's what I'm here to talk about.

23
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.751
It can't be done.

24
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:21.110
- You keep saying that.
- Because it can't be done.

25
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.669
Give me one good reason why not.

26
00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.934
There's no legal precedent for a trial.

27
00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.647
There's no international
law to base the charges on.

28
00:04:29.027 --> 00:04:32.845
No one has ever tried war criminals
outside of one nation's jurisdiction

29
00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:35.108
because the whole
concept of international law is

30
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.803
that one country can't tell another
country's citizens how to conduct themselves.

31
00:04:39.043 --> 00:04:39.163
Elsie.

32
00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:42.102
Trying these men in a
German court would be different.

33
00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:44.450
But what you're talking
about is trying them

34
00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:46.700
in some sort of legal
limbo that doesn't exist

35
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.079
using case law that
hasn't been written yet.

36
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.134
And on the off chance
that you're not keeping

37
00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:53.258
track. that's about four
good reasons why not.

38
00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:54.357
I'm getting you a drink.

39
00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:55.577
I don't want a drink.

40
00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:57.976
Then I'm getting me another
and getting you one for show.

41
00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:00.215
Who do you put on trial?

42
00:05:02.314 --> 00:05:05.233
The German commanders? Enlisted men?

43
00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.172
What about the judges
who enforce the racial codes?

44
00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:10.147
Obviously we'd have to work that out.

45
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:13.830
And once you decide who to put on
trial. what do you charge them with?

46
00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.109
Conspiracy to wage
aggressive war on the world.

47
00:05:17.428 --> 00:05:21.087
And you want the United States
to argue that as prosecution?

48
00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:22.766
I do.

49
00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:26.925
Against Germany?
A country that never attacked us?

50
00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:31.733
Say just for a second it could be done.

51
00:05:31.993 --> 00:05:34.132
- Robert.
- Don't you want to know how I'd do it?

52
00:05:35.312 --> 00:05:39.010
It would have to be a
completely international effort.

53
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.149
All of the allies would
have to participate.

54
00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:49.426
The US. Britain. France. Russia.
You can't do it without the Russians.

55
00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:51.865
Four international judges.

56
00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:53.765
You're talking about a tribunal.

57
00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:58.743
Exactly.
The world needs to know what these men did.

58
00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:00.402
It's a logistical nightmare.

59
00:06:00.662 --> 00:06:01.662
I know.

60
00:06:03.871 --> 00:06:06.300
But it has to be done.

61
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:36.748
Pick a card.

62
00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:41.105
I don't think so.

63
00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.185
Ask me to pick one.

64
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080
Pick a card.

65
00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:08.136
Now ask me to please remember
it and put it back in the deck.

66
00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:12.035
Please remember it and
put it back in the deck.

67
00:07:16.263 --> 00:07:17.263
Now shuffle.

68
00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.518
Now what?

69
00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:30.578
My card was a three of spades.

70
00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:33.157
- Oh. that's hardly a trick.
- Turn over the top one.

71
00:07:45.702 --> 00:07:46.871
Who are you?

72
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.411
I'm a psychiatrist.

73
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.729
Oh. and why are you going to Mondorf?

74
00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.088
I wish I knew.

75
00:07:56.448 --> 00:07:58.907
They send psychiatrists
on secret missions now.

76
00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.266
I'm pretty sure I'm the first.

77
00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:05.894
How did you do that?

78
00:08:06.774 --> 00:08:07.774
With the cards?

79
00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:09.833
I didn't do anything.

80
00:08:11.932 --> 00:08:13.571
You're a really good magician.

81
00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:28.446
Dr. Kelly.

82
00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:30.685
Sgt. Howie Triest at your service.

83
00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:33.044
I'm going to run you under
the commandant's office.

84
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.803
- Tigers. huh?
- Yes. sir.

85
00:08:35.023 --> 00:08:36.143
Perhaps I'll see you around.

86
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:40.401
Jiminy.

87
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:41.821
Who is that?

88
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.599
That Howie was a very attractive woman.

89
00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:46.759
She's a commandant.

90
00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:49.238
Ah. yes. sir. Colonel Andrews.

91
00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:52.636
So can you tell me what I'm
supposed to be doing here?

92
00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:54.276
I thought the war was over.

93
00:08:55.475 --> 00:08:56.535
I couldn't say.

94
00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:59.160
You couldn't say because
you don't know. or you

95
00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:01.433
couldn't say because somebody
told you you couldn't say?

96
00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:03.892
I couldn't say.

97
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:08.330
Don't get sore with me. Doc.
I'm just a translator.

98
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.749
Translator for what?

99
00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:13.488
We'll see.

100
00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:22.125
Dr. Kelly.

101
00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:26.384
Apparently Central Command thinks
you're some kind of hotshot head-shrinker.

102
00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:28.823
I imagine you have some questions for me.

103
00:09:28.963 --> 00:09:30.942
More than a few.
Let's get to it.

104
00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:33.461
You are standing inside
a secret military prison.

105
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:36.800
It currently houses what's
left of the Nazi high command.

106
00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:40.768
The governments of Russia. France.
Great Britain. and our United States

107
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.617
are deciding right now whether to
put these men on trial for their lives.

108
00:09:45.056 --> 00:09:47.995
You have been brought
in to inspect and ensure the

109
00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:51.194
prisoners' mental health
should that trial go forward.

110
00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:53.033
Suicide.

111
00:09:53.523 --> 00:09:55.792
That'll be the main concern
with most of the prisoners.

112
00:09:56.232 --> 00:09:58.851
Hitler. Goebbels. and Himmler
have already taken their own lives.

113
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:01.330
We cannot afford any more losses.

114
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.549
Goebbels and Himmler did it with this.

115
00:10:06.088 --> 00:10:07.208
Hidden cyanide capsule.

116
00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:10.627
The one you'll have to
watch the closest is Göring.

117
00:10:10.927 --> 00:10:12.059
Göring?

118
00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:14.405
Why isn't Hermann Göring?

119
00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:15.585
That's the one.

120
00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:17.764
Hermann Göring's here?

121
00:10:18.604 --> 00:10:20.531
Sergeant. is it possible
that he made you suffer

122
00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:22.522
a large blow to his head
on the way to my office?

123
00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:23.922
Not that I'm aware of. sir.

124
00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:25.621
Sorry. it's just a lot to process.

125
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:27.880
- I'm sure it is. Try and do it faster.
- Yes. sir.

126
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.419
When Göring surrendered.
he was traveling with his family.

127
00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:34.128
He had over a million
dollars in German currency

128
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.917
and jewelry. and a
large quantity of these.

129
00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:39.656
We had them sent back to
the States for classification.

130
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.275
Hydrocodeine.

131
00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:44.794
Fairly potent painkiller. I'm a fan.

132
00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:48.052
He says they're for his heart.

133
00:10:48.432 --> 00:10:52.231
Well. then. I have a rather large
bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

134
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:54.650
These have nothing to do with the heart.
They're an opiate.

135
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.009
How many pills does he take a day?

136
00:10:57.709 --> 00:10:59.288
Sergeant. forty. sir.

137
00:11:00.818 --> 00:11:03.626
Well. I think it's safe to say the
Reichsmarschall's got a drug problem.

138
00:11:04.726 --> 00:11:05.726
Where's his family now?

139
00:11:05.826 --> 00:11:07.905
They've been released.
and they're not your concern.

140
00:11:08.105 --> 00:11:11.903
Your only job is to evaluate
Göring and the others. That is it.

141
00:11:13.123 --> 00:11:16.459
Sir. I'm a good doctor. but
the entire Nazi high command

142
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:19.460
might be a little bit beyond
my area of expertise.

143
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.919
Believe me. Major. this was not my idea.

144
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.119
Dismissed.

145
00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:30.506
He was not great about tox. is he?

146
00:11:31.306 --> 00:11:33.305
Kalman's not known for his warmth. sir.

147
00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:34.445
What are you doing?

148
00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:36.504
Göring. Right now.

149
00:11:37.124 --> 00:11:39.963
- You don't want to get settled first?
- I want to know what I'm dealing with.

150
00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:42.038
All right. well. don't be too intimidating.

151
00:11:42.062 --> 00:11:43.361
I'm not. Tell me about it.

152
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.839
Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. President
of the Reichstag. Minister of Aviation.

153
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:52.418
Commandant-in-Chief of the
Luftwaffe. Minister of Economics.

154
00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:55.177
a founding member of
the Kastafel secret police.

155
00:11:55.777 --> 00:11:57.496
was appointed Hitler's successor in 1939

156
00:11:57.497 --> 00:12:00.875
and is the highest ranking
German military officer of all time.

157
00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:03.893
Okay.
Now I'm a little intimidated.

158
00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:05.713
Don't be. You're good.

159
00:12:08.832 --> 00:12:09.831
Reichsmarschall!

160
00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:16.909
Reichsmarschall Göring. my
name is Dr. Douglas Kelly.

161
00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:20.047
My name is Dr. Douglas Kelly.

162
00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.786
He says. wonderful. a doctor.

163
00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:25.745
I am. I'm going to take your pulse.

164
00:12:28.574 --> 00:12:29.574
Yeah. yeah.

165
00:12:33.897 --> 00:12:35.262
He's been asking for his pills.

166
00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:36.961
He wants you to get them for him.

167
00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:39.400
I understand you've had heart trouble.

168
00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:50.156
Can you open your shirt. please?

169
00:12:58.453 --> 00:13:01.751
Respiration is rapid and shallow.
Don't translate that.

170
00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:06.110
The pills help with the pain as well.

171
00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:15.992
He says he was shot down in World War I.

172
00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:17.725
He has a bullet in his right hip.

173
00:13:18.245 --> 00:13:21.944
In 1923 he was shot in the
groin during the Munich pooch.

174
00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:23.543
You've been shot a lot. sir.

175
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.901
Occupational hazard.

176
00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:33.439
Well. if you really want
to look after your heart.

177
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:35.619
the best way to do that
is to lose some weight.

178
00:13:45.388 --> 00:13:48.194
I'm assure you are looking at the
best physique in all of Germany.

179
00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:49.833
Just ask my wife.

180
00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:53.612
Oh. I'm sure you're right. sir. but
the guards here call you fat stuff.

181
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:03.078
I'm sure it would be difficult for
a lesser man to lose this weight.

182
00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:08.136
but you possess a fortitude and
discipline that others do not. yes?

183
00:14:15.093 --> 00:14:16.493
You see. this man is different.

184
00:14:19.672 --> 00:14:22.271
We're going to be good
friends. I'm sure of it.

185
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.750
I look forward to that.

186
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:28.508
- Good day.
- Auf Wiedersehen.

187
00:14:34.996 --> 00:14:36.455
Inflated sense of self.

188
00:14:37.675 --> 00:14:38.674
Charming.

189
00:14:39.654 --> 00:14:40.654
Speaks English.

190
00:14:42.013 --> 00:14:43.553
What? What? What? What?

191
00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:45.592
The way he looked at
me when I called him fat.

192
00:14:46.731 --> 00:14:48.331
He understood me. He's been playing you.

193
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.229
No. no. why would he pretend?

194
00:14:52.789 --> 00:14:55.208
Translation gives him more
time to consider his answers.

195
00:14:55.568 --> 00:14:57.087
He thinks that gives him an advantage.

196
00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:00.066
Wait. hold on.

197
00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:03.385
You're saying I spent
the last three months

198
00:15:03.386 --> 00:15:05.405
mumbling to myself while
he understood everyone?

199
00:15:05.444 --> 00:15:06.444
Pretty much.

200
00:15:08.973 --> 00:15:10.742
Are you going to tell him that you know?

201
00:15:10.882 --> 00:15:13.401
No. no.
He's going to tell me when he's ready.

202
00:15:14.321 --> 00:15:16.920
- When's that?
- When he determines I'm not a threat.

203
00:15:18.474 --> 00:15:20.519
I want to meet the rest of them.
Who's next?

204
00:15:22.058 --> 00:15:25.577
Dr. Robert Ley. chief of
the German labor front.

205
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.856
one of Hitler's earliest followers.

206
00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:30.511
He once wrote a book
that was so complimentary

207
00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:33.729
that Hitler had the entire run destroyed
because he was so embarrassed.

208
00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:40.271
Ley. who spearheaded the Nazi slave
labor program. was captured in his pajamas.

209
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:42.890
calling himself Dr. Distelmaier.

210
00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:51.807
I'm not like these other power-hungry
men you have locked up in here.

211
00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:56.965
I can smell the Jew.

212
00:15:59.304 --> 00:16:01.283
Great admiral Karl Dönitz.

213
00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:03.402
the German navy's commander in chief.

214
00:16:03.802 --> 00:16:06.502
architect of the U-boat attack
that crippled the British navy.

215
00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:14.958
The fanatical Nazi
with the arrest of Dönitz.

216
00:16:15.278 --> 00:16:17.377
The Third Reich is ended forever.

217
00:16:20.756 --> 00:16:22.695
I've been in custody for 76 days.

218
00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:26.413
I have yet to be formally arrested
or charged with a specific crime.

219
00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:29.112
which is a direct violation
of the Geneva Convention.

220
00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:31.891
Charge me or release me.

221
00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:33.851
Julius Streicher.

222
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.410
Hitler's director of propaganda.

223
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.649
publisher of the national
anti-Semitic paper. De Sturma.

224
00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:43.987
Streicher. docked the high priest of
anti-Semitism and the beast of Franconia.

225
00:16:44.107 --> 00:16:45.546
led the Jewish boycott

226
00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:50.124
and ruled Nuremberg with an iron fist.

227
00:16:52.896 --> 00:16:54.309
He wants to know if you're a Jew.

228
00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.282
No.

229
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:01.280
But you work in a Jewish profession.

230
00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:10.137
What do you fight for. doctor?

231
00:17:14.045 --> 00:17:15.165
Göring is the key.

232
00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:17.924
A leader of a nation in exile.

233
00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:19.523
He binds them all together.

234
00:17:20.543 --> 00:17:23.362
He's begun a strict
self-imposed diet and exercise

235
00:17:23.363 --> 00:17:26.181
regimen and is going
cold turkey on the pills.

236
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.419
It's almost as if he's
training for something.

237
00:17:30.499 --> 00:17:32.649
If one were to write a book about him. it-

238
00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:47.399
Is there a library in town?

239
00:17:47.823 --> 00:17:49.448
- You want to go to a libray?
- Yes!

240
00:17:50.321 --> 00:17:52.521
- At 2:33 in the morning?
- Yes. get your coat.

241
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.119
I'll get my coat.

242
00:17:58.498 --> 00:18:01.297
The sheer amount of narcissists
we got locked up in that hotel.

243
00:18:01.777 --> 00:18:03.836
I bet at least half have books in here

244
00:18:04.011 --> 00:18:06.175
written about them or written by them.

245
00:18:06.805 --> 00:18:08.394
We're going to figure these guys out.

246
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.585
Do you speak any German. doc?

247
00:18:12.213 --> 00:18:13.513
Not even a little.

248
00:18:13.672 --> 00:18:14.672
How'd you learn?

249
00:18:14.772 --> 00:18:16.012
My mother spoke German.

250
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:18.651
I wanted to be like her.

251
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.749
You really think you can do it?

252
00:18:22.109 --> 00:18:23.109
Do what?

253
00:18:24.258 --> 00:18:26.967
Well. get these guys to open up to you.

254
00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:28.407
Sure.

255
00:18:29.906 --> 00:18:30.906
Ow.

256
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.664
Everybody wants to be listened to.

257
00:18:34.824 --> 00:18:35.824
It's a natural instinct.

258
00:18:37.343 --> 00:18:38.403
I learn about them.

259
00:18:39.143 --> 00:18:40.482
I get them to trust me.

260
00:18:41.552 --> 00:18:42.551
They open up.

261
00:18:43.876 --> 00:18:45.001
I make it sound so easy.

262
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.819
What if we could dissect evil?

263
00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:51.638
What sets these men apart from all others?

264
00:18:51.918 --> 00:18:54.577
What enabled them to
commit the crimes that they did?

265
00:18:55.237 --> 00:18:56.436
It almost took over the world.

266
00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.455
You've heard about the work camps for Jews?

267
00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:05.003
Rumor has it

268
00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:06.312
they weren't just work camps.

269
00:19:08.182 --> 00:19:09.181
I've heard.

270
00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:11.440
So how do people become like that?

271
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:14.739
We actually have a shot to figure that out.

272
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.078
To find out

273
00:19:17.798 --> 00:19:20.397
what makes the Germans different.

274
00:19:21.617 --> 00:19:22.616
Different?

275
00:19:24.416 --> 00:19:25.415
From us.

276
00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:29.733
A man who writes a book about
that can make a lot of money.

277
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:37.351
You know. for a second I
thought you were being noble.

278
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.139
You aren't noble?

279
00:19:43.028 --> 00:19:44.028
Fine.

280
00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:48.066
We could psychologically define evil.

281
00:19:49.726 --> 00:19:52.865
We could make sure something
like this never happens again.

282
00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.019
What's going on?

283
00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:09.338
Hermann Göring can't breathe.

284
00:20:11.018 --> 00:20:12.017
Move!

285
00:20:12.157 --> 00:20:13.157
Hallie!

286
00:20:20.414 --> 00:20:21.634
His airway is clear.

287
00:20:21.794 --> 00:20:22.373
That's good. right?

288
00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:23.733
And he's having a heart attack.

289
00:20:23.734 --> 00:20:25.172
Without the prison doctor.

290
00:20:25.252 --> 00:20:25.812
He's on his way.

291
00:20:26.112 --> 00:20:26.712
Tell him to hurry.

292
00:20:27.112 --> 00:20:28.111
Hallie. get some aspirin.

293
00:20:28.191 --> 00:20:29.271
Plain old ordinary aspirin.

294
00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:29.931
You're going to not go.

295
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.230
Hey. hey.

296
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.689
Your heart's still beating.

297
00:20:32.969 --> 00:20:34.029
Which means you're alive.

298
00:20:34.329 --> 00:20:35.568
I'm going to keep you that way.

299
00:20:35.888 --> 00:20:37.188
I need you to stay calm.

300
00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:38.947
Breathe with me.

301
00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:40.007
In and out.

302
00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:42.006
In and out.

303
00:20:42.426 --> 00:20:42.866
I'm here.

304
00:20:43.086 --> 00:20:43.465
I'm here.

305
00:20:43.605 --> 00:20:43.985
Look at me.

306
00:20:44.065 --> 00:20:45.625
I'm here. I'm not going to let you die.

307
00:20:47.284 --> 00:20:48.863
In and out.

308
00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:52.082
Is that your wife?

309
00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:53.602
She's here.

310
00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:55.121
She's here.

311
00:20:56.001 --> 00:20:57.000
Breathe with me.

312
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.359
Hand me a few of those. Hallie.

313
00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:00.839
Thank you. Hallie.

314
00:21:01.938 --> 00:21:03.138
Best thing for the heart.

315
00:21:08.796 --> 00:21:09.875
Trust me.

316
00:21:12.014 --> 00:21:13.074
Breathe in and out.

317
00:21:16.393 --> 00:21:18.052
Your pulse is slow.

318
00:21:19.642 --> 00:21:21.211
Hey. guess what?

319
00:21:21.212 --> 00:21:22.212
You're alive.

320
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:23.270
You're alive.

321
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:23.930
I am.

322
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.289
Well. how about that?

323
00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:27.708
Thank you.

324
00:21:27.848 --> 00:21:29.328
Let's get him to the infomerica. mon.

325
00:21:41.603 --> 00:21:42.643
He smiled for it.

326
00:21:45.102 --> 00:21:47.601
He said thank you in English.

327
00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:56.078
Truman wants to win reelection in 48.

328
00:21:56.338 --> 00:21:59.516
He's not going to do
that coddling of the Nazis.

329
00:21:59.876 --> 00:22:00.876
That's true enough.

330
00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:04.654
Plus. a trial means giving them a
chance to tell their stories to the world.

331
00:22:05.734 --> 00:22:07.293
What are we afraid to hear them tell?

332
00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:09.952
We won the damn war. Bob.

333
00:22:10.812 --> 00:22:14.651
If you do this. it'll turn into the
biggest boondoggle of all time.

334
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.306
Cameras in the damn courtroom.

335
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.689
Well. what if they're sympathetic?

336
00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:20.389
What if all this does
is provide them with a

337
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:22.787
platform for antisemitism
all over the world?

338
00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:25.047
You won't be responsible for that.

339
00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:32.184
You want to know if I'm comfortable
executing a few dances without trial?

340
00:22:33.154 --> 00:22:34.163
Damn right I am.

341
00:22:36.562 --> 00:22:37.842
It doesn't matter anyway.

342
00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:40.021
I'll never get the Russians.

343
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.740
We got the Russians.

344
00:22:43.819 --> 00:22:43.939
What?

345
00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:45.699
We got the Russians.

346
00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:46.938
We did?

347
00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:51.197
Truman called Stalin himself. looking
at Nikichenko for lead prosecutor.

348
00:22:51.756 --> 00:22:52.896
That's fantastic news.

349
00:22:53.036 --> 00:22:54.375
I have no idea who you are.

350
00:22:55.265 --> 00:22:57.824
Colonel John Ammons. sir.
I work for the Judge Advocate General.

351
00:22:58.914 --> 00:23:00.873
So. the Army sent us a lawyer.

352
00:23:02.542 --> 00:23:05.309
Yes. sir. I bring greetings from
General Eisenhower. who says he

353
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:08.230
wants you to know that he's not
for hanging anyone without a trial.

354
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.470
Well. that's progress.

355
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:11.562
He also says he
hopes the trial won't take

356
00:23:11.574 --> 00:23:13.353
too long so we can get
on with hanging them.

357
00:23:14.188 --> 00:23:15.188
Have a seat.

358
00:23:17.287 --> 00:23:20.665
I've read a lot about you. sir. They say
you're going to be the next Chief Justice.

359
00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:22.765
The President promised
him the seat personally.

360
00:23:22.766 --> 00:23:25.453
And swore me into secrecy.
so let's maybe not tell

361
00:23:25.465 --> 00:23:28.163
everyone who walks into
the office about it. okay?

362
00:23:28.502 --> 00:23:31.181
Well. everyone in my office says
there's no way you get the trial.

363
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:33.321
What do you say?

364
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.180
I say I like an underdog.

365
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:37.799
Good morning. Julius.

366
00:23:38.699 --> 00:23:41.765
I'm going to show you a series
of cards. each with ink blots.

367
00:23:41.777 --> 00:23:44.856
and you're going to tell me
what each ink blot makes you see.

368
00:23:46.356 --> 00:23:50.211
Perhaps it will reveal something
about your character. your

369
00:23:50.223 --> 00:23:54.353
intelligence. creativity. and
everything here stays between us.

370
00:23:58.761 --> 00:23:59.761
A doctor?

371
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.260
Yes.

372
00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:07.218
I can't speak to you in
English if it is of some help.

373
00:24:09.477 --> 00:24:10.956
Only if it makes you comfortable.

374
00:24:12.436 --> 00:24:13.435
Shall we begin?

375
00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:15.175
I'm calling you.

376
00:24:15.475 --> 00:24:16.974
I'm Hexen.

377
00:24:17.884 --> 00:24:19.633
This is your director. Torpedo Trevor.

378
00:24:20.093 --> 00:24:21.092
Torpedo Head.

379
00:24:21.412 --> 00:24:22.712
Somebody has spilled something.

380
00:24:24.461 --> 00:24:30.029
I see 10.000 horses.
I see the Valkyries ride.

381
00:24:32.308 --> 00:24:33.308
A vagina.

382
00:24:34.787 --> 00:24:35.147
A vagina?

383
00:24:35.697 --> 00:24:36.696
A vagina?

384
00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:38.766
A Jewish vagina.

385
00:24:40.555 --> 00:24:41.984
A Jewish vagina.

386
00:24:43.564 --> 00:24:44.563
This is blood.

387
00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:45.983
This is blood.

388
00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:49.542
Or ink.

389
00:24:50.386 --> 00:24:51.901
You can say a lot of things with ink.

390
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.039
I'm sorry. Bob. Word came down tonight.
It's going to be a no.

391
00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:04.036
Congress is going to say no to the trial.
They just want executions.

392
00:25:05.435 --> 00:25:06.435
I'm out of moves.

393
00:25:06.495 --> 00:25:07.335
What about the president?

394
00:25:07.515 --> 00:25:10.434
The president wants someone to hide behind.
That's why he needs Congress.

395
00:25:11.263 --> 00:25:13.013
Neither will do it without the other.

396
00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:15.292
So you need someone bigger to back it?

397
00:25:15.712 --> 00:25:17.511
Oh. come on.
Who's bigger than the president?

398
00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:33.415
Jesus Christ.

399
00:25:34.634 --> 00:25:35.634
Literally.

400
00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:37.533
Are you a Catholic?

401
00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:38.953
I am now.

402
00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:43.211
The Holy Father will see you now.

403
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.629
You wish to put this
man on trial for their lives.

404
00:25:49.569 --> 00:25:52.468
Then you have come to ask
for the Church's blessing in this.

405
00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:56.966
Your support would go a long way
to building an international consensus.

406
00:25:57.985 --> 00:25:59.445
No one denies these men are evil.

407
00:26:00.844 --> 00:26:04.763
But an eye for an eye is not the answer.

408
00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:07.782
Maybe not. but I'm pretty
sure where I first read about it.

409
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.220
Are you Catholic?

410
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.099
No. sir.

411
00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:16.358
A religious man?

412
00:26:17.418 --> 00:26:18.418
Not especially.

413
00:26:18.778 --> 00:26:21.636
And yet at home they call you a justice.

414
00:26:22.266 --> 00:26:23.266
I didn't pick the name.

415
00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:25.835
If you sit long enough
in judgment of others.

416
00:26:26.854 --> 00:26:31.353
you come to believe the laws
of man outweigh the laws of God.

417
00:26:33.752 --> 00:26:34.751
I don't believe that.

418
00:26:35.531 --> 00:26:39.290
Then what do you believe?

419
00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:47.706
I believe in man in our capacity to
save ourselves from men like the Nazis.

420
00:26:49.396 --> 00:26:50.985
I believe this to be a good act.

421
00:26:51.425 --> 00:26:54.724
Once so good. you must
circumnavigate your own laws to achieve it.

422
00:26:56.803 --> 00:27:01.421
I'm sorry. but the Catholic
Church cannot support you in this.

423
00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.229
But you could support them in 1933.

424
00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:12.797
I'm sorry?

425
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:16.735
You signed the Concordat
with Hitler yourself.

426
00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:20.894
That was a different matter.

427
00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:24.113
You lived in Munich.
You were the nuncio to the German Empire.

428
00:27:24.912 --> 00:27:30.290
The Catholic Church was the first world
power to acknowledge the pure state.

429
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.829
You gave the Nazis credibility.

430
00:27:32.949 --> 00:27:35.608
In order to protect Catholics in Germany.

431
00:27:35.688 --> 00:27:40.266
Isn't it a pity the Jews didn't
have someone to do that for them?

432
00:27:42.016 --> 00:27:43.705
Do you think I condone what they did?

433
00:27:49.043 --> 00:27:51.282
People will remember. sir.

434
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:54.911
What you did in 1933.

435
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.180
What you do now.

436
00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:01.138
They'll tell their children.

437
00:28:03.957 --> 00:28:06.936
Did the Catholic Church
stand with the Nazis?

438
00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:10.195
Or against them?

439
00:28:16.273 --> 00:28:18.232
Did you just blackmail the Pope?

440
00:28:18.233 --> 00:28:20.431
I don't want to talk about it.

441
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.089
Word came down last night.

442
00:28:26.169 --> 00:28:27.289
There's going to be a trial.

443
00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:32.676
A trial?

444
00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:35.555
Good.

445
00:28:36.255 --> 00:28:37.255
Good.

446
00:28:37.994 --> 00:28:39.254
As it should be.

447
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.959
Those cards that you showed me.

448
00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:54.318
What did they teach you about me?

449
00:28:56.058 --> 00:28:57.947
Honestly. that you are highly intelligent.

450
00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:01.575
I could have told you this.

451
00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:03.975
And that you're a narcissist.

452
00:29:04.694 --> 00:29:08.193
Given to an expansive
and aggressive fantasy life.

453
00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:13.031
With a strong ambition and drive
to subjugate the world as you find it.

454
00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:14.471
To your own pattern of thinking.

455
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.289
And you were surprised by this?

456
00:29:19.749 --> 00:29:20.748
No.

457
00:29:21.788 --> 00:29:24.047
Then the cards have taught you nothing.

458
00:29:25.466 --> 00:29:28.865
Now. Tris. he tells me you do magic.

459
00:29:30.065 --> 00:29:31.064
Einsauber.

460
00:29:32.524 --> 00:29:33.523
Sorry.

461
00:29:35.123 --> 00:29:39.941
Perhaps if it's not too much
trouble. we don't get entertainment.

462
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.299
Why not?

463
00:29:45.699 --> 00:29:49.757
Here's an average ordinary silver dollar.

464
00:29:56.814 --> 00:29:57.814
Ta-da!

465
00:30:00.393 --> 00:30:02.852
Very good. Very good.

466
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:07.430
I will show you a magic trick one day.

467
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.989
What's that?

468
00:30:11.929 --> 00:30:14.608
I am going to escape the hangman's noose.

469
00:30:17.327 --> 00:30:19.426
How do you plan on doing that?

470
00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:25.503
If I were to tell you.
it would not be a trick.

471
00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:29.202
No. I'm not.

472
00:30:31.861 --> 00:30:33.101
This is the end of the episode.

473
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:37.139
You see what the allies are capable of?

474
00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:39.098
There is nothing left.

475
00:30:43.936 --> 00:30:45.176
You said that.

476
00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:56.352
The palace of justice.

477
00:30:58.491 --> 00:31:00.810
The roof has been damaged by the air raids.

478
00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:05.728
Fire gutted the upper floors
and collapsed the clock tower.

479
00:31:05.729 --> 00:31:11.266
But this court room should be able
to hold 600 people when it's finished.

480
00:31:12.366 --> 00:31:13.685
What's with all the supplies?

481
00:31:14.925 --> 00:31:17.444
The Nazis fought their last stand
here when the city was taken.

482
00:31:17.744 --> 00:31:19.163
And so they will again.

483
00:31:21.812 --> 00:31:24.081
All the beautiful cities
in this conquered land.

484
00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:27.340
You want to try them in
this bombed out husk?

485
00:31:28.989 --> 00:31:32.498
This is Sir David Maxwell Fyfe.
assistant prosecutor for the British.

486
00:31:33.997 --> 00:31:34.737
Yes. sir. we do.

487
00:31:34.738 --> 00:31:36.504
For one thing. we
can control the space.

488
00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:39.775
For another. there's an adjoining
prison with room for up to 1200 inmates.

489
00:31:40.535 --> 00:31:42.014
When he needs space for 22.

490
00:31:44.843 --> 00:31:45.553
Sorry. 22. sir.

491
00:31:45.713 --> 00:31:48.832
That's the number of men
we're indicting for the first trial.

492
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:54.529
You see. if we don't win that trial.
there won't be any more trials to come.

493
00:31:54.989 --> 00:31:57.805
And you. myself and Justice
Jackson and our respective

494
00:31:57.817 --> 00:32:00.487
governments will be the
laughingstock of the world.

495
00:32:01.007 --> 00:32:03.346
defeated by the very men we've imprisoned.

496
00:32:04.146 --> 00:32:05.305
So that will be fun.

497
00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:11.323
My friends in Washington say
opinions turn to him against you.

498
00:32:11.723 --> 00:32:17.621
There's talk that you won't get the Chief
Justice's seat when Stone steps down.

499
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:20.979
Well. who's truly going to pick?
Benson? Benson's too political.

500
00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:23.510
Yes. but he's there.
This whole thing's become

501
00:32:23.522 --> 00:32:25.558
a sideshow. Robert.
It hasn't even begun.

502
00:32:27.087 --> 00:32:31.715
They say you're writing
all the briefs yourself.

503
00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:33.615
refusing help from other lawyers.

504
00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:35.094
Because it has to be done right.

505
00:32:35.274 --> 00:32:36.973
And it will. but you can't do it alone.

506
00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:40.112
Oh. everything will be fine
once we actually get to trial.

507
00:32:40.572 --> 00:32:45.070
You say that. as though trying the Nazi
high command with untested case law.

508
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.349
the whole world watching
is going to be the easy part.

509
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:50.448
Well. when you put it like that.

510
00:32:50.853 --> 00:32:54.727
Anything less than total victory
will be considered utter defeat.

511
00:32:55.066 --> 00:32:58.685
which means you don't just have to
win. Robert. You have to be flawless.

512
00:33:00.344 --> 00:33:01.344
No pressure.

513
00:33:03.953 --> 00:33:05.083
I love him. I love him.

514
00:33:05.223 --> 00:33:09.361
Your cells are made of
stone. nine feet by thirteen.

515
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.500
Your beds are bolted to the wall.

516
00:33:13.639 --> 00:33:16.418
Your mattress is stuffed
with straw instead of springs.

517
00:33:17.878 --> 00:33:20.997
Your desks are made of cardboard
and will not support a man's full weight.

518
00:33:21.976 --> 00:33:25.271
Your chairs are never
allowed against any wall

519
00:33:25.283 --> 00:33:28.374
and will be removed
every night at sundown.

520
00:33:28.993 --> 00:33:31.482
When you sleep. your
head and hands will

521
00:33:31.494 --> 00:33:34.431
remain above your
blanket visible at all times.

522
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:37.977
You will be given no
belts. you will be given

523
00:33:37.989 --> 00:33:40.569
no shoelaces. you will
be given no toilet seats.

524
00:33:40.989 --> 00:33:46.107
you will be given nothing with which to
use as a weapon to take your own lives.

525
00:33:49.286 --> 00:33:50.465
Welcome to Nuremberg.

526
00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:23.993
Now this is a cell.

527
00:34:25.032 --> 00:34:26.032
Your proof?

528
00:34:26.352 --> 00:34:29.430
SHermann built. How could I not?

529
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:35.948
They will charge us soon. yeah.

530
00:34:36.268 --> 00:34:37.547
You're looking forward to it?

531
00:34:37.937 --> 00:34:45.804
I believe I am.
I will have. as you say. my day in court.

532
00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:52.901
Do you know this Jackson.
the Justice Jackson?

533
00:34:53.141 --> 00:34:54.141
No. I do not.

534
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:59.239
He will try to outfit me.
but he will not succeed.

535
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:01.488
Very sure of yourself.

536
00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:06.886
Doctor. no man has ever beaten me.

537
00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:12.254
There are books filled with the
names of those who have tried.

538
00:35:14.013 --> 00:35:19.081
I hear you said. SHermann built.

539
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.539
You think I am at some sort of
disadvantage because I sit in a cell.

540
00:35:28.498 --> 00:35:31.497
I will remind you. I surrendered.

541
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:36.885
This is exactly where I desired to be.

542
00:35:39.684 --> 00:35:41.723
Göring remains an enigma to me.

543
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:45.461
The closer we get to the indictments.
the more confident he becomes.

544
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:48.680
I need to figure out a
way to get closer to him.

545
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280
So how do we do that?

546
00:35:53.778 --> 00:35:55.198
We ask for his help.

547
00:35:56.657 --> 00:35:57.657
With what?

548
00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:00.716
Rudolf Hess.

549
00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:05.494
Rudolf Hess is coming here.

550
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:12.371
Rudolf Hess. deputy to the Fuhrer.

551
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:15.170
Third in line for succession
following Hitler and Goethe.

552
00:36:16.909 --> 00:36:20.119
Hess transcribed my income
for Hitler while the two were in

553
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:23.407
prison and was known as one
of his most fanatical followers.

554
00:36:24.067 --> 00:36:25.086
Sieg Heil!

555
00:36:27.206 --> 00:36:29.065
Never do that in my prison again.

556
00:36:36.812 --> 00:36:40.735
On May 10th. 1941. at the
height of the war. Hess climbed into

557
00:36:40.747 --> 00:36:44.809
a Messerschmitt fighter plane
alone and flew over the North Sea.

558
00:36:49.927 --> 00:36:53.805
He bailed out somewhere over
Scotland and broke his ankle upon impact.

559
00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:57.644
Upon his discovery. he
announced that he was Rudolf Hess.

560
00:37:02.302 --> 00:37:06.589
Hess was third in line of the German high command and
he was here on a mission of peace and wanted to speak

561
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.099
with Douglas Douglas Hamilton. the 13th Duke of Hamilton.
whom Hess had met at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.

562
00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:14.198
After some obstacles. Hess
was granted his meeting.

563
00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:24.500
There he announced his intention to meet with
King George VI. have Winston Churchill fired. and

564
00:37:24.512 --> 00:37:28.592
negotiate a truce with Britain allowing the two
nations to join forces and defeat the Soviet Union.

565
00:37:30.152 --> 00:37:32.271
Hess was immediately thrown
into the Tower of London.

566
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.589
There Hess began claiming he had no
memory of past events. even his childhood.

567
00:37:38.248 --> 00:37:44.986
This lasted until February 1945 when he
said his previous amnesia had been faked.

568
00:37:45.706 --> 00:37:48.907
He then flipped again
and said his amnesia had

569
00:37:48.919 --> 00:37:52.063
returned in July 1945
when Germany collapsed.

570
00:37:52.543 --> 00:37:58.141
So now you would come to Hermann
Göring to discredit my old friend.

571
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.458
What would be in this for me?

572
00:38:08.247 --> 00:38:09.247
What do you want?

573
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.484
My wife and my daughter.

574
00:38:17.763 --> 00:38:20.382
No one has been able to
locate them since I surrendered.

575
00:38:22.052 --> 00:38:29.239
I need you to find them for my
daughter and to give to them these letters.

576
00:38:35.527 --> 00:38:39.925
First we talk to Hess and then your family.

577
00:38:42.564 --> 00:38:43.803
How about that?

578
00:38:44.043 --> 00:38:45.958
So what? This guy
almost takes over the whole

579
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.982
world and now he wants
to do a mail run for it?

580
00:38:48.921 --> 00:38:51.926
I'm a deeper with this guy
than anyone's ever been.

581
00:38:51.938 --> 00:38:54.659
And reading his family
will only tell me more.

582
00:38:56.459 --> 00:39:01.917
So. Scudorf. do you remember me?

583
00:39:05.945 --> 00:39:07.225
We were together. yes.

584
00:39:08.704 --> 00:39:10.143
That must have been the case.

585
00:39:11.863 --> 00:39:13.402
But I don't remember anyone.

586
00:39:16.341 --> 00:39:17.900
It was the three of us. Scudorf.

587
00:39:20.439 --> 00:39:22.219
You and I.

588
00:39:25.088 --> 00:39:26.087
And Adolf.

589
00:39:27.937 --> 00:39:29.056
We ruled an empire.

590
00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:33.904
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:39.072 --> 00:39:40.582
You may well have been a friend.

592
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:44.900
But I don't know you anymore.

593
00:39:51.598 --> 00:39:52.597
He is lying.

594
00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:57.775
He has just spent an hour to
say he does not remember me.

595
00:39:59.525 --> 00:40:04.753
But when he arrived in the prison
and he saw me. what did he do?

596
00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:07.611
Salute.

597
00:40:08.871 --> 00:40:09.871
Sicile.

598
00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:14.389
That was very good.

599
00:40:20.876 --> 00:40:23.276
This is dumb. I'm dumb.

600
00:40:23.695 --> 00:40:25.095
I knew you'd come through for me.

601
00:40:25.315 --> 00:40:27.154
Yeah. because I'm a dummy.

602
00:40:32.452 --> 00:40:33.572
How'd you find him?

603
00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:35.751
Local gossip.
Told me they were in Baldurstein.

604
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.110
Smoke?

605
00:40:42.808 --> 00:40:43.888
Never seen you smoke.

606
00:40:45.207 --> 00:40:47.146
Yeah. I don't. Gave it up.

607
00:40:47.147 --> 00:40:49.486
My parents hated this.

608
00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:52.604
You always got them on you.

609
00:40:53.104 --> 00:40:54.943
It's a trick to get in
good with the officers.

610
00:40:56.543 --> 00:40:58.722
Tell myself I'll have a
smoke when the war is done.

611
00:40:59.482 --> 00:41:00.701
The war is done. Howie.

612
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:04.000
It's not too much for them.

613
00:41:25.452 --> 00:41:30.210
Mrs. Gerig.

614
00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.289
Mrs. Gerig.

615
00:41:35.508 --> 00:41:37.207
My name is Douglas Kelly.

616
00:41:38.727 --> 00:41:40.366
I work at the prison. I'm a psychiatrist.

617
00:41:41.985 --> 00:41:43.205
My name is Douglas Kelly.

618
00:41:44.005 --> 00:41:46.084
I work in the hospital. I'm a teacher.

619
00:41:51.162 --> 00:41:53.991
Your husband asked me
to bring you some letters.

620
00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:56.950
Your husband asked me
to bring you some letters.

621
00:41:56.951 --> 00:41:58.465
Your husband asked me
to bring you some letters.

622
00:41:58.489 --> 00:41:59.489
Yes.

623
00:42:00.488 --> 00:42:01.488
Yes.

624
00:42:15.753 --> 00:42:16.752
How is he?

625
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:18.951
He's good.

626
00:42:19.891 --> 00:42:21.790
He's holding it up.

627
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:39.264
Was that you playing?

628
00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:43.792
It was beautiful.

629
00:42:56.147 --> 00:42:58.596
Ah. she said he's a friend of your father.

630
00:43:00.975 --> 00:43:01.975
Is he?

631
00:43:03.834 --> 00:43:04.834
Is he your father?

632
00:43:05.614 --> 00:43:06.613
How is papa?

633
00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:12.311
He's doing very well.

634
00:43:13.631 --> 00:43:14.630
Is he being brave?

635
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:16.150
Very brave.

636
00:43:18.719 --> 00:43:20.428
He wants to be brave too.

637
00:43:21.977 --> 00:43:22.977
He's smart.

638
00:43:23.647 --> 00:43:24.646
He's smart.

639
00:43:24.826 --> 00:43:25.966
He has a lot of stuff to do.

640
00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:29.085
He wrote you a letter.

641
00:43:29.365 --> 00:43:30.384
He wrote you a letter.

642
00:43:37.771 --> 00:43:38.771
Thank you.

643
00:43:40.195 --> 00:43:42.320
Do you want to go to the hospital?
Thank you.

644
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.319
She will be here 100 times. Thank you.

645
00:43:44.719 --> 00:43:45.718
Thank you.

646
00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:54.025
Doctor.

647
00:43:54.235 --> 00:44:00.533
Dr. Hermann.

648
00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:03.542
I don't know if I can.

649
00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:04.831
Peter.

650
00:44:18.016 --> 00:44:19.016
Come back.

651
00:44:28.902 --> 00:44:29.901
Okay. doctor.

652
00:44:44.466 --> 00:44:45.466
What the hell?

653
00:45:14.574 --> 00:45:15.574
Hermann Göring?

654
00:45:16.824 --> 00:45:19.633
I am a race marshal. Hermann Göring.

655
00:45:20.792 --> 00:45:22.759
Hermann Wilhelm Göring.
you are hereby charged by

656

and of a common plan or

extermination. enslavement.
deportation and other inhumane acts.

663
00:45:42.384 --> 00:45:44.823
This is a copy of your indictment.
Do you have any questions?

664
00:45:46.402 --> 00:45:47.402
No.

665
00:45:48.262 --> 00:45:49.261
Good day.

666
00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.220
Who's next?

667
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.859
Striker.

668
00:46:04.245 --> 00:46:05.285
Do you have any questions?

669
00:46:07.584 --> 00:46:11.283
What did he say?

670
00:46:13.007 --> 00:46:14.522
He said he wants a Jewish lawyer.

671
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.340
I'm not going to trial.

672
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.439
You are. Dr. Ley.

673
00:46:23.988 --> 00:46:25.158
I never killed anyone.

674
00:46:28.796 --> 00:46:31.015
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

675
00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:31.655
Robert.

676
00:46:31.895 --> 00:46:32.715
Don't touch me!

677
00:46:32.716 --> 00:46:34.174
Hold him!

678
00:46:34.354 --> 00:46:35.354
Come out!

679
00:46:35.773 --> 00:46:39.142
Don't drive me down!

680
00:46:39.622 --> 00:46:42.621
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

681
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.210
Rough day?

682
00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.629
Lady from the train.

683
00:47:14.769 --> 00:47:15.768
Magic now.

684
00:47:16.828 --> 00:47:18.047
How goes the secret mission?

685
00:47:20.187 --> 00:47:21.406
It's hit a few obstacles.

686
00:47:24.505 --> 00:47:25.764
I can see that.

687
00:47:26.984 --> 00:47:28.024
What are you doing here?

688
00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:31.082
I came in with the press.

689
00:47:32.222 --> 00:47:34.381
Hermann Göring and the
Nazis are being indicted today.

690
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:35.721
No say.

691
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.480
Strap yourself in.

692
00:47:39.879 --> 00:47:42.498
This city is about to become
the greatest show on earth.

693
00:48:18.054 --> 00:48:19.054
Yes. sir.

694
00:48:37.847 --> 00:48:42.305
Dark rumors continue to swirl about
the true purpose of the Nazi work camps.

695
00:48:42.685 --> 00:48:47.623
The legal teams are assembling for what
promises to be the trial of the century.

696
00:48:48.243 --> 00:48:50.882
Through this tunnel. the Nazis
will be taken to the courtroom.

697
00:48:51.132 --> 00:48:53.201
Now being rebuilt for the trial.

698
00:48:53.781 --> 00:48:55.874
There. the film lights
will be so bright that

699
00:48:55.886 --> 00:48:58.179
the court goers will be
provided with sunglasses.

700
00:48:59.039 --> 00:49:01.406
Hermann Göring and his
Hitler-loving cronies are

701
00:49:01.418 --> 00:49:03.797
scheduled to face off
with our boys in one week.

702
00:49:04.217 --> 00:49:07.476
Will justice prevail or
will the fascists go free?

703
00:49:07.835 --> 00:49:11.954
This reporter desperately hopes
that the Allies run into no problems.

704
00:49:13.193 --> 00:49:14.253
We have a problem.

705
00:49:14.973 --> 00:49:20.371
Operation Wieserbund was the German
invasion of Denmark and Norway in 1940.

706
00:49:20.871 --> 00:49:22.758
In the textbook aggressive
war. the Nazis. they

707
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.669
rolled tanks and they
occupied neutral country.

708
00:49:24.749 --> 00:49:28.807
Except they're going to claim that
the invasion was a preemptive strike.

709
00:49:29.547 --> 00:49:30.727
To preempt what?

710
00:49:31.387 --> 00:49:32.746
The British plan to invade Norway.

711
00:49:33.046 --> 00:49:33.906
Well. that's ridiculous.

712
00:49:34.065 --> 00:49:36.664
Absolutely ridiculous.
I'm in complete agreement.

713
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:41.403
It concerns me that you're
in this room right now.

714
00:49:41.843 --> 00:49:45.961
Well. in addition to being
ridiculous. it also happens to be true.

715
00:49:46.371 --> 00:49:49.779
The idea was to use the country as
a staging area to hold the Nazis back.

716
00:49:50.859 --> 00:49:53.423
And to prosecute the Nazis
for planning aggressive

717
00:49:53.435 --> 00:49:55.857
wars if you guys were
planning aggressive wars.

718
00:49:56.177 --> 00:49:57.617
I bet there's a certain logic there.

719
00:49:57.856 --> 00:49:59.036
Can the Nazis prove it?

720
00:49:59.236 --> 00:50:00.893
The German law has
already put in a request

721
00:50:00.905 --> 00:50:02.731
for documents. but they
don't have it. Not yet.

722
00:50:02.755 --> 00:50:03.374
Then we're in the clear.

723
00:50:03.594 --> 00:50:07.853
Maybe. But it raises a bigger issue.

724
00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:13.191
We have to know what the Nazis
know. what their defense strategy is.

725
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.970
How exactly to propose we do that?

726
00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:24.046
Dr. Kelly. you are going to meet
someone very important this evening.

727
00:50:25.286 --> 00:50:27.905
This might actually be your
chance to find the bee of some use.

728
00:50:33.883 --> 00:50:34.882
Impressive. right?

729
00:50:38.531 --> 00:50:41.490
Hitler was building it to be the
largest stadium on the planet.

730
00:50:43.989 --> 00:50:45.168
You're Justice Jackson.

731
00:50:46.568 --> 00:50:47.567
And you're the shrink.

732
00:50:49.627 --> 00:50:51.186
This is where they held the rallies.

733
00:50:51.636 --> 00:50:55.684
Every year. Hitler would pack this
place. speak to the Nazi party as a whole.

734
00:50:57.004 --> 00:50:58.123
They filmed it.

735
00:51:00.592 --> 00:51:04.041
In 1935. this is where he
announced the Nuremberg Laws.

736
00:51:04.981 --> 00:51:05.980
You know the laws?

737
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.911
The Nuremberg Laws
defined a Jew as any person

738
00:51:10.923 --> 00:51:13.358
having three or four
Jewish grandparents.

739
00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:19.035
It didn't matter if you practiced
Judaism. if you converted to Christianity.

740
00:51:19.036 --> 00:51:21.035
This was about blood.

741
00:51:24.763 --> 00:51:28.232
The laws stripped all
Jews of German citizenry.

742
00:51:29.611 --> 00:51:32.423
They made it illegal for
Jews and Germans to marry

743
00:51:32.435 --> 00:51:35.089
each other because of
the fear of Rasenschande.

744
00:51:36.849 --> 00:51:38.328
Defilement of the blood.

745
00:51:41.267 --> 00:51:45.245
Under the laws. Jews were
prohibited from using state hospitals.

746
00:51:45.246 --> 00:51:50.344
And not allowed access to public
education beyond the age of 14.

747
00:51:52.363 --> 00:51:55.202
Libraries. parks. and
beaches were closed to Jews.

748
00:51:56.921 --> 00:52:00.660
War memorials had all Jewish names on them.

749
00:52:01.659 --> 00:52:02.659
Expunged.

750
00:52:03.938 --> 00:52:08.697
All of that was announced
right here on this very ground.

751
00:52:13.395 --> 00:52:14.394
What do you want from me?

752
00:52:16.763 --> 00:52:17.763
Your patients?

753
00:52:19.442 --> 00:52:22.201
I need you to start asking
them the right questions.

754
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.130
What are the right questions?

755
00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:29.988
What they tell their lawyers?

756
00:52:30.748 --> 00:52:32.607
How they plan to defend themselves?

757
00:52:37.496 --> 00:52:38.635
You want me to be a spy?

758
00:52:40.874 --> 00:52:42.933
I want you to do your
duty for your country.

759
00:52:43.033 --> 00:52:45.492
No. you want me to break
Dr. Patient Confidentiality.

760
00:52:45.493 --> 00:52:49.471
I think you already have. doctor.
We read every report.

761
00:52:50.371 --> 00:52:51.370
We need more.

762
00:53:03.306 --> 00:53:04.385
Why not just shoot them?

763
00:53:06.494 --> 00:53:07.604
Just whatever he wants.

764
00:53:08.764 --> 00:53:10.843
I mean. if you're just gonna
cheat... That's not cheating.

765
00:53:10.923 --> 00:53:12.682
If you're asking me to betray my oath...

766
00:53:15.721 --> 00:53:17.920
Why not just shoot
them and be done with it?

767
00:53:21.329 --> 00:53:23.868
After the last great war.
we made Germany crawl.

768
00:53:25.817 --> 00:53:27.127
We humiliated them.

769
00:53:27.427 --> 00:53:29.486
Made them pay reparations
they couldn't afford.

770
00:53:31.245 --> 00:53:34.324
We made them hate us so much
that in less than two decades...

771
00:53:35.803 --> 00:53:39.282
They went from a broken
nation to near world conquerors.

772
00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:43.121
We had to do this right
because if we don't...

773
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:47.119
If fifteen years from now they
come back even stronger...

774
00:53:49.478 --> 00:53:51.317
I don't know if we can
beat them a third time.

775
00:53:54.676 --> 00:53:57.405
If we just shoot these
men. we make them martyrs.

776
00:53:58.175 --> 00:53:59.444
I'm not gonna allow them that.

777
00:54:00.924 --> 00:54:02.703
There will be no statues of them.

778
00:54:04.023 --> 00:54:05.142
No songs of praise.

779
00:54:07.771 --> 00:54:10.210
I'm gonna put Hermann
Göring on the stand...

780
00:54:11.455 --> 00:54:13.469
And I'm gonna make him
tell the world what he did.

781
00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:17.387
So that it can never happen again.

782
00:54:25.464 --> 00:54:26.984
You brought me here because of Göring.

783
00:54:28.103 --> 00:54:29.103
No.

784
00:54:32.432 --> 00:54:36.870
I brought you here to show you
that before the bullets were fired...

785
00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:41.348
Before tens of millions of men died...

786
00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:45.167
All of this started with laws.

787
00:54:47.126 --> 00:54:50.145
This war ends in a courtroom.

788
00:54:52.764 --> 00:54:53.764
With Göring?

789
00:54:54.563 --> 00:54:56.363
He's the face of the Nazis now.

790
00:54:57.662 --> 00:54:59.341
As he falls. so do they all.

791
00:55:01.811 --> 00:55:03.280
But if I'm gonna do that...

792
00:55:05.629 --> 00:55:06.999
I need to be ready for it.

793
00:55:11.432 --> 00:55:12.431
Will you help me?

794
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:30.929
Let's talk about Hitler.

795
00:55:35.458 --> 00:55:38.537
It is interesting you have not
asked me this directly before.

796
00:55:39.686 --> 00:55:42.235
I'm curious what the attraction was.

797
00:55:43.994 --> 00:55:45.134
There was a failed painter.

798
00:55:45.854 --> 00:55:47.413
Not a very good soldier yet.

799
00:55:48.233 --> 00:55:49.432
He was worshipped and revered.

800
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:54.510
He made us feel German again.

801
00:55:59.898 --> 00:56:00.898
How?

802
00:56:02.797 --> 00:56:04.677
Bears of white skinned Germany craft.

803
00:56:06.176 --> 00:56:11.794
And along comes a man who says...
We can reclaim our former glory.

804
00:56:14.533 --> 00:56:16.252
Would you not follow a man like this?

805
00:56:17.492 --> 00:56:19.131
Depends what else you wanted to do.

806
00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:28.838
The first time I saw
Hitler talk was... 1922.

807
00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:31.636
Upstairs of a coffee shop.

808
00:56:31.996 --> 00:56:33.136
For maybe 30 people.

809
00:56:35.075 --> 00:56:39.533
This was peacetime. but it was a
peace without food. jobs. shoes.

810
00:56:41.093 --> 00:56:42.092
And he stood up.

811
00:56:42.812 --> 00:56:47.210
And he said French bellies are
being filled with German pain.

812
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:53.828
And then... If you make
threats. you need bayonets.

813
00:56:54.687 --> 00:56:56.867
Griard. Down with Versailles.

814
00:56:59.346 --> 00:57:00.345
So that night...

815
00:57:01.155 --> 00:57:02.924
I became a National Socialist.

816
00:57:05.963 --> 00:57:08.003
Off of... One speech?

817
00:57:08.302 --> 00:57:11.541
I could tell he would
appeal to the old soldiers.

818
00:57:11.542 --> 00:57:13.701
If they have the old soldiers.
they have the manpower.

819
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.139
Even with his antisemitism.
it served a practical purpose.

820
00:57:19.018 --> 00:57:22.337
It brought towards us men who needed
something else to focus their emotions.

821
00:57:23.057 --> 00:57:24.056
Something else to blame.

822
00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:27.735
And the camps?

823
00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:37.001
They were to be work camps
for our political opponents.

824
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:38.961
Nothing more.

825
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.720
And you signed off on that?

826
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.259
For work camps. yeah.

827
00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:45.640
Do not think that the
Japanese entered by the

828
00:57:45.652 --> 00:57:48.777
Americans after Pearl
Harbor were not put to work?

829
00:57:48.877 --> 00:57:49.896
Of course they were.

830
00:57:51.776 --> 00:57:55.114
I made the camps for the good
of Germany. for the war effort.

831
00:57:57.374 --> 00:57:58.373
Not for death.

832
00:58:00.872 --> 00:58:01.872
Himmler.

833
00:58:02.552 --> 00:58:03.551
Heitrich.

834
00:58:04.191 --> 00:58:05.191
They were responsible?

835
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:11.668
If it is true. what they say
happened at the camps.

836
00:58:14.227 --> 00:58:17.026
This is a grave blight on
the great German Reich.

837
00:58:21.105 --> 00:58:22.894
Have you told your lawyer about this?

838
00:58:25.633 --> 00:58:28.912
Douglas. I will not
stand against the Fuhrer.

839
00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.030
Not even if I can help you.

840
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:36.249
These are not things
people need to know. Doctor.

841
00:58:38.708 --> 00:58:39.707
Only you.

842
00:58:42.626 --> 00:58:43.786
He can be sympathetic.

843
00:58:45.885 --> 00:58:47.325
It is going to be a problem for you.

844
00:58:47.504 --> 00:58:50.323
He seriously claims that he
thought they were only work camps.

845
00:58:50.423 --> 00:58:50.803
That is right.

846
00:58:51.123 --> 00:58:52.123
Do you believe him?

847
00:58:53.967 --> 00:58:55.242
Himmler ran the camps.

848
00:58:56.381 --> 00:58:57.561
He was the head of the SS.

849
00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.600
Göring was the head of the Air Force.

850
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.823
How often in America does
the head of the Air Force

851
00:59:01.835 --> 00:59:03.978
know what the head of
the Secret Service is doing?

852
00:59:04.118 --> 00:59:07.313
I am sorry. but I cannot believe that we
are having this conversation right now.

853
00:59:07.337 --> 00:59:08.177
I am doing what you ask.

854
00:59:08.337 --> 00:59:10.436
No. you are apologizing for him.

855
00:59:10.536 --> 00:59:12.451
Gentlemen. please.
I am not the one defending the Nazi.

856
00:59:12.475 --> 00:59:16.134
You think I am defending him?
I am analyzing him. you provincial moron.

857
00:59:17.933 --> 00:59:21.172
Göring is. above all things. a narcissist.

858
00:59:21.771 --> 00:59:25.670
The only thing he cares about is building
Germany up and then becoming her leader.

859
00:59:25.965 --> 00:59:27.749
He does not care about the Jews.

860
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:29.089
So he is fine with them dying.

861
00:59:29.249 --> 00:59:30.344
And he is fine with them not.

862
00:59:30.368 --> 00:59:33.907
The only thing Hermann Göring
cares about is Hermann Göring.

863
00:59:34.267 --> 00:59:36.553
Does that sound like
a man who dedicates

864
00:59:36.565 --> 00:59:39.265
himself to the extermination
of an entire race?

865
00:59:43.223 --> 00:59:46.510
Well. Dr. Kelly. I really
appreciate your thoughtfulness

866
00:59:46.522 --> 00:59:49.821
on this. but I have to admit
it is very hard to believe.

867
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.119
You want to walk into that courtroom
with a handful of assumptions?

868
00:59:56.458 --> 00:59:57.458
Fine.

869
00:59:58.827 --> 01:00:01.236
But he will eat you for breakfast.

870
01:00:10.823 --> 01:00:18.010
I would like to apologize for my
outbursts earlier. It felt much better.

871
01:00:24.497 --> 01:00:25.737
I felt a chance to be shifting.

872
01:00:26.257 --> 01:00:28.536
And you?
Something seems to be troubling you.

873
01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:32.794
I am fine.

874
01:00:34.574 --> 01:00:35.573
I am fine.

875
01:00:36.293 --> 01:00:37.293
I am fine.

876
01:00:38.172 --> 01:00:38.492
I am fine.

877
01:00:38.692 --> 01:00:38.772
I am fine.

878
01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:43.070
I am fine.

879
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.769
This will all be over soon.

880
01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:54.446
Blaze mode is markedly improved.

881
01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:58.944
He told us he has begun making
arrangements for his defense.

882
01:01:00.304 --> 01:01:04.222
I feel as though for the first
time he has reached out to me.

883
01:01:24.984 --> 01:01:28.203
He ripped out the hem of
his towel to make a rope.

884
01:01:29.903 --> 01:01:34.361
He stuffed his underwear into his
mouth so he wouldn't scream and then...

885
01:01:35.071 --> 01:01:38.919
just leaned forward. apparently
with a great deal of determination.

886
01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:42.183
You didn't see any of this coming?

887
01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:43.717
He told me he was doing better.

888
01:01:45.996 --> 01:01:46.996
Told you.

889
01:01:49.615 --> 01:01:50.895
I'm supposed to keep them alive.

890
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:03.310
I'm bringing in another doctor.

891
01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:07.188
A firm and a second opinion is
required for some of your patients.

892
01:02:09.088 --> 01:02:12.946
Dr. Gilbert arrives this afternoon.
You will brief him.

893
01:02:19.404 --> 01:02:21.013
How do you feel about suicide?

894
01:02:27.171 --> 01:02:29.780
The last refuge of cowards. yeah.

895
01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:33.938
And the last act of a desperate man?

896
01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:37.957
So all his exceptions. of course.

897
01:02:43.395 --> 01:02:44.784
You are in trouble.

898
01:02:45.764 --> 01:02:46.763
Why would you say that?

899
01:02:47.423 --> 01:02:53.101
A new doctor. new tests.
Since Lai died. they no longer trust you.

900
01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:54.900
Your own?

901
01:02:57.119 --> 01:03:02.497
Douglas. when you are
in a position of power.

902
01:03:05.036 --> 01:03:06.776
they will always come after you.

903
01:03:07.605 --> 01:03:09.135
You have to protect yourself.

904
01:03:09.674 --> 01:03:12.313
Why would I have to
protect myself from my allies?

905
01:03:13.353 --> 01:03:15.212
Just because a man is your ally

906
01:03:16.187 --> 01:03:18.391
does not mean he is on your side.

907
01:03:19.811 --> 01:03:22.050
My father was a
diplomat. did I tell you this?

908
01:03:24.749 --> 01:03:25.748
Yeah.

909
01:03:28.757 --> 01:03:32.366
He was posted to Africa.

910
01:03:34.275 --> 01:03:37.304
And it was there he was
to meet his best friend.

911
01:03:38.344 --> 01:03:42.142
a man named Hermann von Epstein.

912
01:03:44.441 --> 01:03:46.281
I was named after him.

913
01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.939
Yeah.

914
01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:52.258
I was named for a Jew.

915
01:03:55.517 --> 01:03:59.875
We loved Uncle Hermann
so much. he was very rich.

916
01:04:01.485 --> 01:04:03.414
He lived in Frozenstein Castle.

917
01:04:05.403 --> 01:04:07.432
And when I was six years old.

918
01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:12.451
he moved my entire family in with him.

919
01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:14.690
Can you imagine?

920
01:04:15.949 --> 01:04:18.488
It was a child's dream
to live in such a castle.

921
01:04:19.928 --> 01:04:23.226
I would run down the halls.
pretending I was a knight.

922
01:04:24.546 --> 01:04:30.244
I would stare down from the battlements.
envisioning armies forming to attack.

923
01:04:31.983 --> 01:04:36.861
Uncle Hermann. he lived in the largest
and most beautiful room on the top floor.

924
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.080
Down the hall. my mother
had a bedroom. also beautiful.

925
01:04:43.359 --> 01:04:44.358
My father.

926
01:04:47.057 --> 01:04:49.496
he lived in a small
bedroom on the ground floor.

927
01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:56.674
And I was to realize just
how rich Uncle Hermann was.

928
01:04:58.193 --> 01:05:01.672
So rich that he could move my family in.

929
01:05:02.561 --> 01:05:05.530
So rich that he could put
my father on the ground floor.

930
01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:10.069
So rich that whenever he wanted.

931
01:05:11.928 --> 01:05:13.507
he could walk down the hall

932
01:05:16.776 --> 01:05:18.285
and enjoy my mother.

933
01:05:21.524 --> 01:05:23.294
Just because a man is your ally

934
01:05:24.653 --> 01:05:27.252
does not mean he is on your side.

935
01:05:35.759 --> 01:05:38.128
You found Hermann going to be imaginative?

936
01:05:39.307 --> 01:05:41.767
I didn't find him to be that way.
The test did.

937
01:05:42.546 --> 01:05:44.765
Well. that is what a second opinion is for.

938
01:05:47.104 --> 01:05:50.203
Which brings us to Rudolph Hess.

939
01:05:52.023 --> 01:05:55.641
I'm inclined to believe
that his amnesia is genuine.

940
01:05:55.921 --> 01:05:58.080
You mean the part where
he forgets about being a Nazi?

941
01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.836
Okay. look. Dr.

942
01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.038
Kelly. I'm not here to
step on your toes. okay?

943
01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.317
I'll share research with a co-author.

944
01:06:08.776 --> 01:06:09.776
Co-author of what?

945
01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:13.175
You don't have to play coy with me.
We're both here for the same reason.

946
01:06:14.674 --> 01:06:18.434
Now. two books about the Nazi high command
that's going to cut into the market.

947
01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:21.072
I say we write it together.

948
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:28.469
Good luck with your tests.

949
01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.521
She was in.

950
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:49.881
Thank you.

951
01:06:54.569 --> 01:06:56.098
Come and see Peter Haines.

952
01:07:57.725 --> 01:08:00.624
Oh. she was. uh. astounded.

953
01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:02.263
Teach me this trick.

954
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.082
Is it a coin by the ear?

955
01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:07.981
Yeah. yeah. Teach me this
trick so I. too. can astound her.

956
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.779
I gave my silver dollar to your daughter.

957
01:08:14.328 --> 01:08:15.618
It's the simplest trick in the world.

958
01:08:15.619 --> 01:08:18.157
And it works because. you
know. people want to believe.

959
01:08:19.726 --> 01:08:21.756
Well. you hold up the dollar and you say.

960
01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:25.994
Hey. folks. here is an
ordinary average silver dollar.

961
01:08:27.273 --> 01:08:29.613
And you put it in your other hand.

962
01:08:31.562 --> 01:08:33.191
You focus on it.

963
01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.910
But really. it's right here.

964
01:08:38.659 --> 01:08:40.928
You palm it in your right hand.

965
01:08:41.388 --> 01:08:42.388
Palm it?

966
01:08:42.638 --> 01:08:44.907
You put it between these two fingers.

967
01:08:45.716 --> 01:08:47.306
You wrap your palm around it.

968
01:08:47.606 --> 01:08:48.885
But you focus on your left hand.

969
01:08:51.904 --> 01:08:54.323
And you feel the coin
in there. the weight of it.

970
01:08:54.963 --> 01:08:56.642
And if you believe it.

971
01:08:57.452 --> 01:08:58.941
then they'll believe it.

972
01:09:00.861 --> 01:09:02.280
And then you just. uh.

973
01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.039
well. you reach behind the ear.

974
01:09:06.259 --> 01:09:07.258
Abracadabra!

975
01:09:11.806 --> 01:09:12.916
What is abracadabra?

976
01:09:14.156 --> 01:09:15.295
Uh. it's a magic word.

977
01:09:15.655 --> 01:09:20.353
It gives the illusion of a cosmic weight.

978
01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:22.772
And it always must be abracadabra.

979
01:09:23.852 --> 01:09:25.431
No. it can be anything.

980
01:09:25.696 --> 01:09:27.111
It can be presto.

981
01:09:29.255 --> 01:09:30.609
I think I prefer abracadabra.

982
01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:33.408
So it was your father
who taught you this trick?

983
01:09:34.648 --> 01:09:35.647
My father?

984
01:09:35.767 --> 01:09:36.767
No.

985
01:09:37.986 --> 01:09:39.926
You say that like it is unthinkable.

986
01:09:41.175 --> 01:09:43.005
And my father was content to

987
01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:46.823
buy his trade and display
a cheerful disposition.

988
01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.001
He was a man of no accomplishment.

989
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:53.041
But you believe

990
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.579
you are destined for more.

991
01:09:58.589 --> 01:10:00.638
You want to be known as a great man.

992
01:10:06.606 --> 01:10:07.605
Yes.

993
01:10:08.065 --> 01:10:09.524
And I am your ticket.

994
01:10:13.203 --> 01:10:16.072
You will return to America as
the great scholar of the Nazis.

995
01:10:17.891 --> 01:10:21.770
And I will have a trick
to impress my daughter

996
01:10:22.779 --> 01:10:24.549
when this trial is done.

997
01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:32.596
Stop taking me with you to see him.

998
01:10:36.654 --> 01:10:38.114
I didn't want to bother you so late.

999
01:10:39.943 --> 01:10:41.632
I've been seeing him a lot without me.

1000
01:10:42.692 --> 01:10:43.691
What are you doing. doc?

1001
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:46.690
Trying to learn something?

1002
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:50.149
Are you sure that's
what this is still about?

1003
01:10:53.468 --> 01:10:54.467
Good night. Howie.

1004
01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.663
Are you going to defend yourself. Hermann?

1005
01:11:07.232 --> 01:11:10.081
Oh. but not too late now.

1006
01:11:10.121 --> 01:11:11.121
I'm serious.

1007
01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:16.609
Have you friends. doctor?

1008
01:11:19.018 --> 01:11:22.707
I think that word is a little
too simple for what we are.

1009
01:11:25.655 --> 01:11:29.444
But are you asking
me this as a friend?

1010
01:11:32.733 --> 01:11:33.732
I am.

1011
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:42.829
Tomorrow. when I enter my plea.

1012
01:11:44.863 --> 01:11:46.088
I will read a statement.

1013
01:11:47.207 --> 01:11:48.267
I am going to say

1014
01:11:49.656 --> 01:11:52.965
that I assume all
responsibility for my actions.

1015
01:11:53.485 --> 01:11:54.704
I will refuse. however.

1016
01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:58.803
to accept responsibility
for acts committed by others

1017
01:11:59.502 --> 01:12:00.782
that I was unaware of

1018
01:12:02.141 --> 01:12:03.781
and I would not have approved of.

1019
01:12:07.529 --> 01:12:08.529
But I did.

1020
01:12:11.768 --> 01:12:12.847
I did for my country.

1021
01:12:14.827 --> 01:12:16.646
Tell me you have not
done the same for yours.

1022
01:12:34.909 --> 01:12:36.648
They told me I could find you here.

1023
01:12:41.896 --> 01:12:42.956
In seven hours.

1024
01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.794
the whole world is going
to be focused on this room.

1025
01:12:50.853 --> 01:12:51.853
This is it.

1026
01:12:53.152 --> 01:12:54.152
This is everything.

1027
01:13:01.319 --> 01:13:04.458
This is the statement that
Gerhard plans on reading tomorrow.

1028
01:13:11.685 --> 01:13:12.705
Thank you.

1029
01:16:36.457 --> 01:16:37.576
May it please your honors.

1030
01:16:41.535 --> 01:16:42.535
the privilege

1031
01:16:43.524 --> 01:16:45.753
of opening the first trial in history

1032
01:16:46.753 --> 01:16:49.052
for crimes against the peace of the world

1033
01:16:49.352 --> 01:16:51.291
imposes a grave responsibility.

1034
01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:57.189
The wrongs which we
seek to condemn and punish

1035
01:16:58.448 --> 01:16:59.828
have been so calculated.

1036
01:17:01.347 --> 01:17:03.387
so malignant and so devastating

1037
01:17:04.726 --> 01:17:08.425
that civilization cannot
tolerate their being ignored

1038
01:17:10.024 --> 01:17:12.803
because we cannot
survive their being repeated.

1039
01:17:16.242 --> 01:17:17.631
In the prisoner's dock

1040
01:17:18.881 --> 01:17:20.630
said 20-odd broken men.

1041
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:22.929
we will show them

1042
01:17:23.664 --> 01:17:27.747
to be living symbols of racial hatreds.

1043
01:17:28.427 --> 01:17:30.946
of terrorism and violence.

1044
01:17:32.805 --> 01:17:34.125
and of the arrogance

1045
01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:37.923
and cruelty of power.

1046
01:17:40.402 --> 01:17:46.510
Civilization can afford nothing

1047
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.409
with the men in whom these forces

1048
01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:51.818
now precariously survive.

1049
01:17:57.386 --> 01:17:59.295
Wars are no longer local.

1050
01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:03.054
All modern wars

1051
01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:06.972
become world wars. eventually.

1052
01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:12.050
And none of the big nations can stay out.

1053
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:15.289
But the ultimate step

1054
01:18:16.769 --> 01:18:18.548
in avoiding periodic wars

1055
01:18:18.823 --> 01:18:21.267
in a system of international lawlessness

1056
01:18:23.206 --> 01:18:26.945
is to make statesmen
responsible for the law.

1057
01:18:29.674 --> 01:18:30.923
And let me make clear

1058
01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:34.642
that while this law is first applied
against German aggressors.

1059
01:18:35.102 --> 01:18:37.701
it must condemn aggression
by any other nation.

1060
01:18:37.971 --> 01:18:40.581
including those who sit
here now in judgment.

1061
01:18:41.809 --> 01:18:44.118
We are able to do away

1062
01:18:45.048 --> 01:18:46.337
with domestic tyranny

1063
01:18:46.787 --> 01:18:48.257
and violence and aggression

1064
01:18:48.746 --> 01:18:51.575
by those in power against
the rights of their own people

1065
01:18:53.025 --> 01:18:55.554
only when we make all men

1066
01:18:57.053 --> 01:18:59.272
insurable to the law.

1067
01:19:13.397 --> 01:19:14.397
Hermann Kering.

1068
01:19:16.776 --> 01:19:18.315
the defendants are to plead guilty

1069
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:19.790
or not guilty

1070
01:19:19.935 --> 01:19:21.294
to the charges against them.

1071
01:19:22.094 --> 01:19:23.573
They will proceed in turn

1072
01:19:24.023 --> 01:19:25.023
to a point in the dock

1073
01:19:25.452 --> 01:19:26.632
opposite to the microphone.

1074
01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.866
I am Hermann Wilhelm Kering.

1075
01:19:42.426 --> 01:19:45.725
I stand before the
court today and the world

1076
01:19:46.175 --> 01:19:48.124
and pledge only to tell...

1077
01:19:49.653 --> 01:19:51.243
The tribunal has reached the decision

1078
01:19:51.892 --> 01:19:55.321
that the defendants are not
entitled to make a statement.

1079
01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:58.241
They will be permitted
to address the court

1080
01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.799
prior to their sentencing.

1081
01:20:02.808 --> 01:20:04.218
As Reichsmarschall of Germany.

1082
01:20:04.358 --> 01:20:05.897
You are not Reichsmarschall here.

1083
01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:10.155
You are only Hermann
Kering. the prisoner.

1084
01:20:10.575 --> 01:20:13.254
Do you plead
guilty or not guilty?

1085
01:20:19.022 --> 01:20:20.401
Yes. Schutig.

1086
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:49.780
Emmy!

1087
01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.139
Eva!

1088
01:20:53.379 --> 01:20:54.379
Emmy!

1089
01:20:55.858 --> 01:20:56.858
What happened?

1090
01:20:57.517 --> 01:20:58.717
What happened? Where are they?

1091
01:20:59.037 --> 01:21:01.636
What? Where are they?

1092
01:21:01.876 --> 01:21:02.835
They took them.

1093
01:21:02.895 --> 01:21:03.895
Who?

1094
01:21:04.295 --> 01:21:05.294
Americans.

1095
01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:44.639
You've got to be shitting me.

1096
01:21:45.919 --> 01:21:47.138
Thanks. I'm going to need it.

1097
01:21:49.213 --> 01:21:50.817
They arrested Emmy Gering

1098
01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:53.896
on suspicion of complicity
with her husband's art thefts.

1099
01:21:54.336 --> 01:21:55.335
The kid goes to the nuns.

1100
01:21:55.615 --> 01:21:56.615
No contact allowed.

1101
01:21:57.115 --> 01:21:58.194
They're women and children.

1102
01:21:59.554 --> 01:22:00.553
Yeah.

1103
01:22:01.643 --> 01:22:02.972
Sir. we're supposed to be better than this.

1104
01:22:02.973 --> 01:22:04.412
It's out of my hands.

1105
01:22:05.811 --> 01:22:06.811
And you're welcome.

1106
01:22:10.529 --> 01:22:11.529
By the way.

1107
01:22:12.559 --> 01:22:14.078
how did you know where she was hiding?

1108
01:22:25.804 --> 01:22:27.383
Did Etta play for you again?

1109
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:31.362
She did.

1110
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:34.120
She's very talented.

1111
01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.340
She likes you.

1112
01:22:38.889 --> 01:22:39.888
Do you have the letters?

1113
01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:42.957
No.

1114
01:22:44.147 --> 01:22:46.016
No letters. unfortunately.

1115
01:22:46.856 --> 01:22:47.855
No?

1116
01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:50.114
Next time.

1117
01:22:55.023 --> 01:22:56.412
Here's the menu. Doctor.

1118
01:22:57.232 --> 01:22:59.171
You're just talking about my family.

1119
01:22:59.571 --> 01:23:00.390
Ah. yes.

1120
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.570
That's fine. I'm sorry to hear about that.

1121
01:23:04.609 --> 01:23:05.608
That's fine.

1122
01:23:05.908 --> 01:23:06.908
Their arrest?

1123
01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:09.827
Your wife and daughter
were arrested five days ago.

1124
01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.486
He didn't tell you?

1125
01:23:18.004 --> 01:23:19.483
Hey. Hey.

1126
01:23:19.843 --> 01:23:20.843
What the hell was that?

1127
01:23:21.522 --> 01:23:24.041
That was me being honest with my patients.

1128
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:25.597
Something you ought to try sometime.

1129
01:23:25.621 --> 01:23:26.940
You destroyed him in there.

1130
01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120
So?

1131
01:23:34.158 --> 01:23:35.637
Hey! Hey!

1132
01:23:37.516 --> 01:23:38.956
Jesus Christ.

1133
01:23:39.256 --> 01:23:40.895
You're mental health professionals!

1134
01:23:41.515 --> 01:23:42.514
For Christ's sake!

1135
01:23:46.413 --> 01:23:49.922
Doctor Gilbert. would you like me
to place Doctor Kelly under arrest?

1136
01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.900
No. sir.

1137
01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.559
Then get out of my goddamn office!

1138
01:24:07.595 --> 01:24:09.034
All rise!

1139
01:24:23.959 --> 01:24:25.068
May it please the court.

1140
01:24:25.788 --> 01:24:29.467
the prosecution would now like to enter
into evidence the following film footage.

1141
01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:34.485
The images you are about to see
have never before been shown in public.

1142
01:24:35.464 --> 01:24:37.723
This film should offer a brief explanation

1143
01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:42.202
of what the words
concentration camp implied.

1144
01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:02.514
These are the locations of the
largest concentration and prison camps

1145
01:25:02.739 --> 01:25:06.492
maintained throughout Germany and
occupied Europe under the Nazi regime.

1146
01:25:09.931 --> 01:25:11.808
The 4th Armored Division
of General Patton's

1147
01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.710
3rd Army liberated
this camp early in April.

1148
01:25:17.108 --> 01:25:20.043
They see the woodshed
where lime-covered bodies are

1149
01:25:20.055 --> 01:25:22.886
stacked in layers and the
stench is overpowering.

1150
01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:36.911
Slave labor camp at Nordhausen liberated
by the 3rd Armored Division. 1st Army.

1151
01:25:37.431 --> 01:25:40.777
At least 3.000 political prisoners
died here at the brutal hands of

1152
01:25:40.789 --> 01:25:44.148
SS troops and pardon German
criminals who were the camp's daughter.

1153
01:25:45.248 --> 01:25:49.146
Nordhausen has been a depository
for slaves found unfit for work in

1154
01:25:49.158 --> 01:25:53.245
the underground B-bomb plants and
in other German camps and factories.

1155
01:25:58.173 --> 01:26:01.012
Amid the corpses are human
skeletons too weak to move.

1156
01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:08.523
None of our medical
battalions work two days and

1157
01:26:08.535 --> 01:26:10.818
nights binding wounds
and giving medications.

1158
01:26:11.498 --> 01:26:15.796
But for advanced cases of starvation
and tuberculosis there are often no cures.

1159
01:26:16.976 --> 01:26:20.554
Survivors are shown being evacuated
for treatment in Allied hospitals.

1160
01:26:33.759 --> 01:26:38.327
I'm Lieutenant Senior Grade Jack H. Taylor.
U.S. Navy. from Hollywood. California.

1161
01:26:38.667 --> 01:26:41.506
Believe it or not. this is the first
time I've ever been in the movies.

1162
01:26:42.086 --> 01:26:43.945
I was captured December 1st.

1163
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:49.983
I was taken to this Mauthausen
concentration locker. an extermination camp.

1164
01:26:54.441 --> 01:27:02.438
where we have been starving and beaten
and killed. forcibly my turn hadn't come.

1165
01:27:06.986 --> 01:27:10.518
There were five or
six ways by cast. by

1166
01:27:10.530 --> 01:27:14.983
shooting. by beating.
against beating with clubs.

1167
01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:23.561
by exposure. that is. standing
out in the snow naked for 48 hours

1168
01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:27.239
and having cold water thrown
on them in the middle of winter.

1169
01:27:30.487 --> 01:27:34.176
starvation. dogs. and
pushing over a 100-foot cliff.

1170
01:27:36.175 --> 01:27:39.534
This is all true. has been
seen. and is now being reported.

1171
01:27:45.462 --> 01:27:49.060
Nationalities and prison numbers are
tattooed on the stomachs of the inmates.

1172
01:27:58.177 --> 01:28:02.195
In the official report. the Buchenwald
camp is termed an extermination factory.

1173
01:28:04.135 --> 01:28:07.333
Bodies stacked one upon the other
were found outside the crematory.

1174
01:28:12.012 --> 01:28:16.233
The body disposal plant. Inside are
the ovens which gave the crematorium

1175
01:28:16.245 --> 01:28:20.009
a maximum disposal capacity of
about 400 bodies per 10-hour day.

1176
01:28:24.027 --> 01:28:28.096
A car near München. one of the
oldest of the Nazi prison camp.

1177
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:48.208
This is what the liberators
found inside the building.

1178
01:29:14.638 --> 01:29:17.275
Hanging an orderly road
were the clothes of prisoners

1179
01:29:17.287 --> 01:29:19.686
who had been suffocated
in a lethal gas chamber.

1180
01:29:20.965 --> 01:29:24.732
They had been persuaded to
remove their clothing under the pretext

1181
01:29:24.744 --> 01:29:28.123
of taking a shower for which
towels and soap were provided.

1182
01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.381
Planetary conditions were so
appalling that heavy equipment

1183
01:29:37.393 --> 01:29:40.388
had to be brought in to
speed the work of cleaning up.

1184
01:30:02.235 --> 01:30:04.759
This was Bergen-Belsen.

1185
01:30:43.674 --> 01:30:44.673
Righted so.

1186
01:30:50.616 --> 01:30:51.616
How is it possible?

1187
01:30:55.439 --> 01:30:56.439
Himmler.

1188
01:30:57.059 --> 01:30:58.718
Himmler wasn't second in command.

1189
01:30:59.783 --> 01:31:02.437
You were 1200 camps?

1190
01:31:03.696 --> 01:31:05.715
What am I supposed to
believe that he didn't know?

1191
01:31:05.855 --> 01:31:07.375
Anyone can fake an atrocity.

1192
01:31:07.455 --> 01:31:10.114
So you're saying the film was a fake?
That's your defense?

1193
01:31:10.314 --> 01:31:11.369
What would you have me say?

1194
01:31:11.393 --> 01:31:13.033
How about the truth for once?

1195
01:31:13.173 --> 01:31:16.331
So you can run and tell Jackson?

1196
01:31:18.331 --> 01:31:22.489
My friend. your hypocrisy is stunning.

1197
01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:24.528
My hypocrisy?

1198
01:31:24.628 --> 01:31:26.887
You think American bullets
and bombs don't kill people?

1199
01:31:27.707 --> 01:31:31.551
You vaporize 150.000
Japanese at the touch of a button

1200
01:31:31.563 --> 01:31:35.704
and you presume to stand in
judgment on me for all crimes?

1201
01:31:35.764 --> 01:31:37.179
We had every right to defend ourselves.

1202
01:31:37.203 --> 01:31:39.443
How do you defend yourself
on someone else's soil?

1203
01:31:39.543 --> 01:31:41.805
There's a difference
between us bombing war

1204
01:31:41.817 --> 01:31:44.461
factories and civilians
dying as collateral damage

1205
01:31:44.611 --> 01:31:51.018
and you building 1200 human slaughterhouses
designed to exterminate an entire race.

1206
01:31:51.758 --> 01:31:53.197
And you know it!

1207
01:31:53.517 --> 01:31:55.077
What do you think war is?

1208
01:31:58.875 --> 01:31:59.905
Not what I thought today.

1209
01:32:00.185 --> 01:32:03.064
What do you think the Russians
do to German prisoners of war?

1210
01:32:03.713 --> 01:32:08.122
You have your freedom and I am a
prisoner because you've earned and we lost.

1211
01:32:08.521 --> 01:32:10.081
Not because you are morally superior!

1212
01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.459
This trial will be a farce in 15 years.

1213
01:32:15.159 --> 01:32:17.598
Great conquerors and not
thought of as murderers.

1214
01:32:18.558 --> 01:32:22.236
Genghis Khan. Alexander the
Great... You're not Alexander the Great!

1215
01:32:24.565 --> 01:32:26.914
You are a fat man in a cell.

1216
01:32:29.074 --> 01:32:36.821
And you know I have made a mistake.

1217
01:32:41.419 --> 01:32:43.038
You are not destined for more.

1218
01:32:44.508 --> 01:32:48.076
You will have an unhappy life. I think.

1219
01:32:50.995 --> 01:32:53.015
It will all be overshadowed by this.

1220
01:32:54.294 --> 01:32:55.753
By the time spent with me.

1221
01:32:57.173 --> 01:33:00.192
You will write your
volumes trying to relive it.

1222
01:33:01.011 --> 01:33:02.571
The one moment in your life.

1223
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.990
When you actually stood with greatness.

1224
01:33:07.049 --> 01:33:08.209
You think you're a great man?

1225
01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:12.877
You think that's your legacy?

1226
01:33:13.567 --> 01:33:14.806
At least I will have one.

1227
01:33:15.906 --> 01:33:18.545
You will leave no mark on this world.

1228
01:33:19.764 --> 01:33:20.764
I am the book!

1229
01:33:21.384 --> 01:33:23.643
You are merely a footnote.

1230
01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:30.650
They're gonna kill you.

1231
01:33:32.429 --> 01:33:37.108
They're gonna hang you by
the neck until you piss yourself.

1232
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:39.447
And die.

1233
01:33:42.441 --> 01:33:43.480
Your wife will be a widow.

1234
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:46.764
Your daughter will be an orphan.

1235
01:33:50.762 --> 01:33:52.362
And you will have done that to yourself.

1236
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.939
I know who you are.

1237
01:34:27.239 --> 01:34:28.258
What do you like?

1238
01:34:29.118 --> 01:34:30.337
You don't wanna know.

1239
01:34:31.177 --> 01:34:33.416
Jackson's putting him on
the stand day after tomorrow?

1240
01:34:36.275 --> 01:34:38.174
Jackson's gonna get killed.

1241
01:34:39.254 --> 01:34:40.254
Why do you say that?

1242
01:34:41.653 --> 01:34:44.652
Because Gary is ready for him.

1243
01:34:46.731 --> 01:34:48.790
He was ready for all of us.

1244
01:34:53.079 --> 01:34:57.117
Why don't you tell me all about it?

1245
01:34:59.546 --> 01:35:00.546
Look at that!

1246
01:35:00.936 --> 01:35:04.814
Your private conversations with
Hermann Göring made the front page.

1247
01:35:05.394 --> 01:35:06.394
You're finished.

1248
01:35:07.673 --> 01:35:09.432
I signed your transfer order this morning.

1249
01:35:09.832 --> 01:35:12.391
You're to be sent back to the
states where you'll be discharged.

1250
01:35:12.931 --> 01:35:16.370
You have embarrassed me
and this office for the last time.

1251
01:35:18.289 --> 01:35:19.289
I'm sorry. Colonel.

1252
01:35:21.738 --> 01:35:22.737
You deserve better.

1253
01:35:22.887 --> 01:35:23.887
Yes. I did.

1254
01:35:25.856 --> 01:35:30.185
And just so you know. we are
releasing Göring's wife and daughter.

1255
01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:32.944
You were right. We are better than that.

1256
01:35:37.682 --> 01:35:38.681
Thank you. sir.

1257
01:35:38.881 --> 01:35:40.041
Your train's at five o'clock.

1258
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.059
Don't take this the wrong way.
but I never wanna see you again.

1259
01:35:58.964 --> 01:35:59.963
Care to say goodbye?

1260
01:36:01.183 --> 01:36:02.182
Did you really mean it?

1261
01:36:02.342 --> 01:36:03.582
You said Jackson had no chance?

1262
01:36:04.152 --> 01:36:07.101
Sure. It's all just a big show
for the cameras anyway.

1263
01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.620
So it doesn't matter what happens tomorrow.

1264
01:36:10.324 --> 01:36:12.019
If Göring beats Jackson. so be it.

1265
01:36:12.179 --> 01:36:13.258
Yeah. I don't believe that.

1266
01:36:15.697 --> 01:36:16.697
Neither do you.

1267
01:36:18.626 --> 01:36:20.535
You know more about
him than anybody on Earth.

1268
01:36:22.055 --> 01:36:23.154
Yeah. that's right. I do.

1269
01:36:24.744 --> 01:36:26.583
You know. I spent
thousands of hours with him.

1270
01:36:26.693 --> 01:36:28.352
I run hundreds of tests.

1271
01:36:28.572 --> 01:36:30.152
You know what sets him apart from us?

1272
01:36:31.611 --> 01:36:32.611
Nothing.

1273
01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:35.050
I know.

1274
01:36:37.249 --> 01:36:38.249
You know?

1275
01:36:39.498 --> 01:36:40.708
Because I'm one of them.

1276
01:36:42.842 --> 01:36:43.921
What are you talking about?

1277
01:36:45.346 --> 01:36:46.705
I'm German. Doc.

1278
01:36:48.625 --> 01:36:49.624
I grew up in Munich.

1279
01:36:51.044 --> 01:36:53.603
You grew up in Detroit.
You said your mom spoke German.

1280
01:36:53.763 --> 01:36:54.762
She did.

1281
01:36:54.902 --> 01:36:55.902
But my father.

1282
01:36:57.771 --> 01:36:58.881
Because I was raised here.

1283
01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.840
You're an American soldier.

1284
01:37:04.009 --> 01:37:05.008
Why'd you leave?

1285
01:37:07.627 --> 01:37:08.627
Why do you think?

1286
01:37:14.815 --> 01:37:15.814
You're a Jew.

1287
01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:26.440
You know. with the blonde
hair and the blue eyes.

1288
01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.800
I never got a hassle much.

1289
01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.358
My father was a patriot.

1290
01:37:33.098 --> 01:37:34.897
He fought for Germany
in the First World War.

1291
01:37:37.871 --> 01:37:39.025
We loved this country.

1292
01:37:41.525 --> 01:37:43.364
Eventually he realized we had to get out.

1293
01:37:46.952 --> 01:37:47.952
How'd you do?

1294
01:37:49.921 --> 01:37:51.571
The problem was getting travel visas.

1295
01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:55.669
Other countries wouldn't take us.

1296
01:37:56.849 --> 01:37:59.987
My dad had a cousin in New York who helped.

1297
01:38:01.827 --> 01:38:03.786
We finally got our visa in 1940.

1298
01:38:06.155 --> 01:38:08.704
But we only had enough
money for one ticket out.

1299
01:38:12.053 --> 01:38:13.412
My little sister. Margo...

1300
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:17.411
She was only 11. so...

1301
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:20.370
My parents didn't want her traveling alone.

1302
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:23.129
Until they sent me.

1303
01:38:27.187 --> 01:38:28.806
Boy. how seasick the whole way.

1304
01:38:33.515 --> 01:38:35.474
When I landed. I stayed with my cousin.

1305
01:38:38.693 --> 01:38:40.132
When the Nazis invaded Holland.

1306
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:46.350
my family never showed up.

1307
01:38:50.593 --> 01:38:51.818
That's when I went to Detroit.

1308
01:38:54.457 --> 01:38:56.896
I got a job as an
apprentice in a tool factory

1309
01:38:58.135 --> 01:39:00.214
when the English listened
to baseball on the radio.

1310
01:39:02.774 --> 01:39:03.973
When Pearl Harbor happened.

1311
01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:07.072
I was the first one

1312
01:39:07.722 --> 01:39:09.171
in the recruitment office to enlist.

1313
01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.020
You know what they said?

1314
01:39:14.819 --> 01:39:16.048
They couldn't take me.

1315
01:39:16.908 --> 01:39:18.388
Because I wasn't an American citizen.

1316
01:39:20.667 --> 01:39:22.506
I'd have to wait to get drafted.

1317
01:39:25.395 --> 01:39:26.395
So I did.

1318
01:39:28.194 --> 01:39:29.733
I waited. and I waited.

1319
01:39:30.483 --> 01:39:33.432
I checked the mailbox
every day for two years.

1320
01:39:36.771 --> 01:39:38.410
June 6th. 1944.

1321
01:39:40.489 --> 01:39:43.068
Landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day.

1322
01:39:48.576 --> 01:39:49.746
Four years earlier.

1323
01:39:52.645 --> 01:39:53.704
I left this country.

1324
01:39:54.924 --> 01:39:57.843
scared and alone in
the middle of the night.

1325
01:40:01.961 --> 01:40:03.960
But I came back with a goddamn army.

1326
01:40:08.588 --> 01:40:09.588
I found Margo.

1327
01:40:11.947 --> 01:40:14.026
She's in Switzerland.

1328
01:40:14.456 --> 01:40:15.456
She's 16 now.

1329
01:40:15.646 --> 01:40:16.765
She's living with relatives.

1330
01:40:18.705 --> 01:40:19.744
She's good.

1331
01:40:21.733 --> 01:40:23.383
She made it.

1332
01:40:24.822 --> 01:40:25.822
And her folks.

1333
01:40:28.821 --> 01:40:30.840
The records show that

1334
01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.158
my parents arrived at
Auschwitz August 12th. 1942.

1335
01:40:38.707 --> 01:40:41.856
The camp was liberated January 27th. 1945.

1336
01:40:46.914 --> 01:40:48.463
No sign of them.

1337
01:40:50.892 --> 01:40:53.531
The Nazis had a name
for what they did to us.

1338
01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.639
The Final Solution.

1339
01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.477
Like we were

1340
01:41:07.686 --> 01:41:09.655
some kind of nagging puzzle

1341
01:41:10.575 --> 01:41:12.794
that they finally figured out how to solve.

1342
01:41:17.472 --> 01:41:18.532
So sorry. Howie.

1343
01:41:20.921 --> 01:41:22.410
I don't want to tell Stryker.

1344
01:41:26.179 --> 01:41:27.178
I want to tell him

1345
01:41:27.938 --> 01:41:30.777
right before they put
that rope around his neck.

1346
01:41:30.897 --> 01:41:33.736
I'm going to tell that piece of
shit that he was confining in a Jew.

1347
01:41:39.154 --> 01:41:40.353
You say it doesn't matter

1348
01:41:41.743 --> 01:41:42.743
what happens tomorrow.

1349
01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:49.330
It matters.

1350
01:41:52.304 --> 01:41:53.304
More you know

1351
01:41:55.803 --> 01:41:57.087
matters to me.

1352
01:41:59.316 --> 01:42:00.316
to my family.

1353
01:42:01.555 --> 01:42:02.555
to all of Germany.

1354
01:42:03.565 --> 01:42:04.684
Göring has to fall.

1355
01:42:13.081 --> 01:42:14.760
You think he's going to beat Jackson?

1356
01:42:17.439 --> 01:42:18.439
Don. please.

1357
01:42:19.618 --> 01:42:20.998
Do something about it.

1358
01:42:25.316 --> 01:42:26.316
I can't.

1359
01:42:29.755 --> 01:42:30.754
You can't what?

1360
01:42:33.963 --> 01:42:34.963
I'm just a shrink.

1361
01:42:52.981 --> 01:42:55.355
You want to know why it happened here?

1362
01:42:58.304 --> 01:42:59.303
People let it happen.

1363
01:43:01.223 --> 01:43:03.522
Because they didn't stand
up until it was too late.

1364
01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:08.390
Have a safe trip home. Doc.

1365
01:43:21.825 --> 01:43:23.384
Yes. sir. Of course.

1366
01:43:26.143 --> 01:43:29.002
No. I... I completely
understand.

1367
01:43:31.161 --> 01:43:32.201
Thank you.

1368
01:43:36.019 --> 01:43:37.099
Son of a gun.

1369
01:43:38.998 --> 01:43:42.617
Truman's just named Frederick Vinson
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

1370
01:43:45.526 --> 01:43:47.255
Yeah. I didn't want the job anyway.

1371
01:43:47.695 --> 01:43:48.695
Who would?

1372
01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:51.473
Welcome's up.

1373
01:43:54.532 --> 01:43:55.812
You're walking into a trap.

1374
01:43:56.372 --> 01:43:58.872
Dr. Kelly. I was under the
impression you'd been relieved.

1375
01:43:58.931 --> 01:44:01.330
Putting Göring on the stand
gives him everything he wants.

1376
01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:03.209
It's why he surrendered in the first place.

1377
01:44:03.509 --> 01:44:06.329
His last chance to redeem
the Reich on the world stage.

1378
01:44:06.468 --> 01:44:08.043
After what I read in
the paper this morning.

1379
01:44:08.067 --> 01:44:09.746
I don't believe I care
what you think anymore.

1380
01:44:09.766 --> 01:44:10.626
You can't beat him.

1381
01:44:10.627 --> 01:44:11.166
Charles!

1382
01:44:11.626 --> 01:44:12.625
Not without help.

1383
01:44:13.865 --> 01:44:15.644
This is everything I have on him.

1384
01:44:16.124 --> 01:44:18.403
Private files. off-the-book conversations.

1385
01:44:18.823 --> 01:44:20.963
I know more about this man
than anyone else on the planet.

1386
01:44:21.362 --> 01:44:22.362
And it's all in here.

1387
01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.280
Why do you have this?

1388
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:30.309
I was gonna write a book.

1389
01:44:32.918 --> 01:44:34.167
Make something of myself.

1390
01:44:38.386 --> 01:44:39.385
It's okay.

1391
01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:42.824
So you really think I can't beat him?

1392
01:44:43.724 --> 01:44:44.723
Honestly?

1393
01:44:46.822 --> 01:44:47.822
I don't know.

1394
01:44:49.391 --> 01:44:50.981
You know. I was gonna be Chief Justice.

1395
01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.959
I'll be lucky if there's a place
on the court for me when I return.

1396
01:44:56.479 --> 01:44:59.018
As of six hours ago. I was
discharged from the army.

1397
01:45:00.362 --> 01:45:02.057
There's nothing left for us to do. sir.

1398
01:45:04.845 --> 01:45:06.395
Might as well go finish the war.

1399
01:45:15.951 --> 01:45:19.530
The trick is to use his vanity against him.

1400
01:45:20.549 --> 01:45:22.309
He is the Reich Marshall.

1401
01:45:23.089 --> 01:45:25.688
And the Reich Marshall is never wrong.

1402
01:45:26.587 --> 01:45:27.687
You can't beat him.

1403
01:45:27.927 --> 01:45:30.226
Every decision that's led him to this place

1404
01:45:30.746 --> 01:45:32.205
has to be the right one.

1405
01:45:32.465 --> 01:45:34.264
So as much as he
won't want to talk about

1406
01:45:34.265 --> 01:45:37.683
the camps and the SS
and the final solution.

1407
01:45:38.463 --> 01:45:40.302
you can make him own them.

1408
01:45:41.541 --> 01:45:42.541
Kelly's right.

1409
01:45:42.821 --> 01:45:45.060
Get him to admit to signing those orders.

1410
01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.079
And you'll have him.

1411
01:45:48.839 --> 01:45:49.978
I'll have him.

1412
01:45:53.087 --> 01:45:54.387
This is your day.

1413
01:45:55.726 --> 01:45:56.726
You're ready.

1414
01:47:10.717 --> 01:47:11.917
No idea. sir.

1415
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:32.849
Justice Jackson. are you ready?

1416
01:47:50.582 --> 01:47:53.561
The prosecution now calls
Hermann Göring to the stand.

1417
01:48:42.932 --> 01:48:45.671
For the record. is there
any doubt in your mind

1418
01:48:45.921 --> 01:48:47.331
that Adolf Hitler is dead?

1419
01:48:51.449 --> 01:48:52.559
I have no doubt.

1420
01:48:54.438 --> 01:48:55.438
So you are aware

1421
01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:59.676
that this makes you the only
living man who can expound to us

1422
01:48:59.826 --> 01:49:01.915
the true purposes of the Nazi party

1423
01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:04.114
and the inner workings of its leadership?

1424
01:49:06.014 --> 01:49:08.053
I am perfectly aware of this. sir.

1425
01:49:09.962 --> 01:49:14.490
Your party from the very beginning
intended to overthrow the Weimar Republic.

1426
01:49:17.529 --> 01:49:19.149
That was our firm intention.

1427
01:49:20.868 --> 01:49:21.867
What the hell?

1428
01:49:21.907 --> 01:49:23.347
And upon coming to power.

1429
01:49:23.507 --> 01:49:26.486
you immediately abolished
parliamentary government in Germany.

1430
01:49:27.025 --> 01:49:28.725
We found it to be no longer necessary.

1431
01:49:29.954 --> 01:49:33.383
Is that because you believe people
are not capable of self-government?

1432
01:49:36.302 --> 01:49:38.181
We were elected by the people

1433
01:49:39.021 --> 01:49:41.060
and given a mandate for change.

1434
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:46.458
The systems that had previously existed
had brought Germany to the verge of ruin.

1435
01:49:47.478 --> 01:49:49.277
The old president of Roosevelt said

1436
01:49:49.677 --> 01:49:51.476
there are certain peoples in Europe

1437
01:49:52.056 --> 01:49:53.236
who have forsaken democracy

1438
01:49:54.335 --> 01:49:56.814
not because they did not wish for it.

1439
01:49:57.544 --> 01:50:01.412
but because democracy had
brought forth men who were too weak.

1440
01:50:05.351 --> 01:50:06.540
After you came to power.

1441
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:11.419
you regarded it necessary to
suppress all opposition parties. correct?

1442
01:50:12.318 --> 01:50:16.057
We found it necessary to no
longer permit opposition here.

1443
01:50:16.757 --> 01:50:20.975
And you also considered it immediately
necessary to establish concentration camps?

1444
01:50:22.194 --> 01:50:27.992
The camps were set up as a measure
against the communists and their violence.

1445
01:50:28.512 --> 01:50:31.531
So it was necessary to
erect a camp for them.

1446
01:50:31.631 --> 01:50:33.510
run two or three camps.
something like this.

1447
01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:37.569
You also had to have certain groups

1448
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:40.987
to carry out orders and fight
for you if necessary. right?

1449
01:50:41.887 --> 01:50:45.386
Certain groups... Well. for example.
if you wanted certain people killed.

1450
01:50:46.605 --> 01:50:49.124
you had to have some
organization that would kill them.

1451
01:50:50.324 --> 01:50:52.338
Yeah. Germany had
this level of political

1452
01:50:52.339 --> 01:50:54.283
police that you would
find in any other country.

1453
01:50:54.322 --> 01:50:58.221
And the SA and the SS were the
organizations that carried out these orders

1454
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:01.779
and dealt with people on a
physical level. were they not?

1455
01:51:02.019 --> 01:51:05.198
The SA never received
orders to kill anybody.

1456
01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:07.477
Neither did the SS. not in my time.

1457
01:51:07.577 --> 01:51:10.256
Beyond a certain point.
I had no influence on it.

1458
01:51:11.396 --> 01:51:13.615
The SS carried out arrests.

1459
01:51:15.014 --> 01:51:17.893
They handled the transportation of
people to the concentration camps.

1460
01:51:18.013 --> 01:51:19.253
Can you not recall a time

1461
01:51:20.142 --> 01:51:21.992
when the SS began to perform the function

1462
01:51:21.993 --> 01:51:24.551
of acting as the executor
of the Nazi party?

1463
01:51:24.731 --> 01:51:26.930
It would be very
difficult for me to explain

1464
01:51:26.931 --> 01:51:31.568
to an outsider whether the SS or whether
the Gestapo may or may not be active.

1465
01:51:32.868 --> 01:51:33.867
Try.

1466
01:51:35.167 --> 01:51:37.986
Perhaps as the police came more and more

1467
01:51:38.185 --> 01:51:39.435
into the hands of Himmler.

1468
01:51:40.135 --> 01:51:41.734
expectations may have changed.

1469
01:51:41.974 --> 01:51:44.868
And. of course. it is well
known that some SS units were

1470
01:51:44.869 --> 01:51:49.391
guarding the camps and later
performed some police functions.

1471
01:51:52.590 --> 01:51:54.769
And carried out other
functions in the camps?

1472
01:51:56.029 --> 01:51:57.588
To what functions do you refer?

1473
01:51:59.597 --> 01:52:04.585
They carried out all of the
functions of the camps. didn't they?

1474
01:52:10.153 --> 01:52:13.342
If an SS unit was guarding a camp.

1475
01:52:14.632 --> 01:52:17.760
and an SS leader was the camp commandant.

1476
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:21.579
send it to the rational to assume

1477
01:52:23.028 --> 01:52:27.657
that they would have carried
out all of the functions of the camp.

1478
01:52:30.126 --> 01:52:34.154
You have said that you wanted a
strong German state to overcome

1479
01:52:34.155 --> 01:52:36.293
the conditions of
Versailles. is that correct?

1480
01:52:36.473 --> 01:52:40.132
We wanted a strong German
state. regardless of Versailles.

1481
01:52:40.292 --> 01:52:42.471
The first country to be absorbed by Germany

1482
01:52:42.472 --> 01:52:46.409
was Austria. but it had not been part
of Germany before the First World War.

1483
01:52:46.859 --> 01:52:50.589
and it had not been taken from Germany by
the Treaty of Versailles. is that correct?

1484
01:52:50.888 --> 01:52:52.467
That is not entirely correct.

1485
01:52:52.607 --> 01:52:57.765
The second territory taken by Germany was
Bohemia. then Moravia. and then Slovakia.

1486
01:52:59.175 --> 01:53:02.903
These were not taken from
Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.

1487
01:53:03.133 --> 01:53:05.202
nor had they been part of Germany

1488
01:53:05.477 --> 01:53:07.182
before the First World War. had they?

1489
01:53:07.183 --> 01:53:08.961
These parts of Czech territory

1490
01:53:09.661 --> 01:53:14.679
were not part of the smaller German Reich
at the time of the Treaty of Versailles.

1491
01:53:15.518 --> 01:53:22.776
However. formally. they were united to
the German Reich for hundreds of years.

1492
01:53:22.777 --> 01:53:25.415
You still have not answered my question.

1493
01:53:25.416 --> 01:53:27.014
I have answered your question.

1494
01:53:27.179 --> 01:53:28.893
If the facts do not suit you.

1495
01:53:29.153 --> 01:53:30.533
there is very little I can do.

1496
01:53:30.553 --> 01:53:31.812
Can you not answer yes or no?

1497
01:53:32.532 --> 01:53:36.650
Time may not mean quite as much
to you as it does to the rest of us.

1498
01:53:36.670 --> 01:53:39.449
Mr. Justice. the tribunal
thinks the witness ought to

1499
01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:44.327
be allowed to make what
explanations he thinks right.

1500
01:53:44.667 --> 01:53:47.706
I trust that the court is not unaware
that outside of this courtroom

1501
01:53:48.306 --> 01:53:51.605
is a great social question
regarding the revival of Nazism.

1502
01:53:51.865 --> 01:53:55.583
and that one of the purposes
of declaring is to encourage

1503
01:53:55.584 --> 01:53:59.941
and perpetuate it by propaganda
from this trial now in process.

1504
01:54:00.751 --> 01:54:04.940
This witness has adopted in the
witness box and the prisoner's dock

1505
01:54:05.289 --> 01:54:10.178
an arrogant and contemptuous attitude
towards this tribunal. which is giving him

1506
01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:12.437
the opportunity of a trial.

1507
01:54:13.001 --> 01:54:14.476
which he never gave a living soul.

1508
01:54:14.996 --> 01:54:17.115
The ruling stands. Mr. Justice.

1509
01:54:23.402 --> 01:54:26.641
I must of course bow to
the ruling of the tribunal

1510
01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:32.419
and would simply request that the witness
find a way to keep his answers succinct.

1511
01:54:36.817 --> 01:54:38.637
Could you please repeat the question?

1512
01:54:40.976 --> 01:54:44.335
They were not taken from you

1513
01:54:44.834 --> 01:54:46.374
by the Treaty of Versailles.

1514
01:54:46.494 --> 01:54:50.412
where of course Austria was
taken by the Versailles Treaty

1515
01:54:50.587 --> 01:54:51.892
and also through Detenland.

1516
01:54:53.961 --> 01:54:57.050
For both these territories would
have been German territories

1517
01:54:57.749 --> 01:54:59.289
for the simple rights of the people

1518
01:54:59.539 --> 01:55:00.888
to self-determination.

1519
01:55:02.877 --> 01:55:04.107
I find that interesting.

1520
01:55:05.177 --> 01:55:07.198
considering you just
testified that people's

1521
01:55:07.199 --> 01:55:09.805
self-determination was
the first thing you took away.

1522
01:55:12.464 --> 01:55:13.803
From the very beginning.

1523
01:55:14.323 --> 01:55:18.661
you regarded the elimination of
Jews from the economic life of Germany

1524
01:55:19.061 --> 01:55:23.779
as one phase of the four-year plan
under your jurisdiction. Is that correct?

1525
01:55:24.459 --> 01:55:25.459
Partially correct.

1526
01:55:25.519 --> 01:55:27.198
Partially. I see.

1527
01:55:28.523 --> 01:55:31.896
I would like to review with you briefly

1528
01:55:32.916 --> 01:55:36.195
public acts taken by you in
reference to the Jewish question.

1529
01:55:37.214 --> 01:55:39.833
First. did you proclaim the Nuremberg Laws?

1530
01:55:42.657 --> 01:55:43.892
Yes. I did.

1531
01:55:44.292 --> 01:55:47.111
As president of the
Reichstag. that was my job.

1532
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:48.750
What date was that?

1533
01:55:50.089 --> 01:55:52.109
The 15th of September. 1935.

1534
01:55:52.289 --> 01:55:55.447
And on the first day of December 1936.

1535
01:55:55.807 --> 01:55:58.506
you passed an act making it
a death penalty for Germans

1536
01:55:58.756 --> 01:55:59.986
to transfer property abroad?

1537
01:56:01.105 --> 01:56:02.105
That is correct.

1538
01:56:02.225 --> 01:56:05.264
That was the decree governing
restriction on foreign contracts.

1539
01:56:05.265 --> 01:56:06.863
And on April 22. 1938.

1540
01:56:07.203 --> 01:56:08.203
you published penalties

1541
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:11.761
within the Reich.

1542
01:56:12.221 --> 01:56:13.221
Concealing.

1543
01:56:13.341 --> 01:56:15.260
Then on April 26. 1938.

1544
01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.863
you signed a decree
ordering the registration of

1545
01:56:17.864 --> 01:56:20.478
all Jewish property inside
and outside of Germany.

1546
01:56:21.697 --> 01:56:24.836
If it is signed by me... Then a
decree on November 12. 1938

1547
01:56:25.186 --> 01:56:29.714
imposing a fine of one billion
Reichsmarks for atonement on all Jews.

1548
01:56:30.094 --> 01:56:32.913
And that all damages
caused to Jewish property

1549
01:56:33.238 --> 01:56:34.672
by the riots of 1938

1550
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:42.489
are many details here.

1551
01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:46.128
The insurance company... And the
decree on the 17th of September 1940

1552
01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:49.167
ordering the sequestration of
all Jewish property in Poland.

1553
01:56:49.447 --> 01:56:52.183
Yeah. in that part of
Poland that was a former

1554
01:56:52.184 --> 01:56:54.985
German province and
would return to Germany.

1555
01:56:56.544 --> 01:56:58.903
A decree asking Himmler and Heydrich

1556
01:56:59.853 --> 01:57:01.842
to make plans for
the final solution

1557
01:57:02.142 --> 01:57:03.142
of the Jewish question.

1558
01:57:10.449 --> 01:57:11.448
That is not correct.

1559
01:57:12.178 --> 01:57:13.508
I know that decree very well.

1560
01:57:14.967 --> 01:57:16.067
I ask that you show

1561
01:57:17.046 --> 01:57:18.046
the document number 1110.

1562
01:57:18.616 --> 01:57:19.965
exhibit number USA509.

1563
01:57:23.224 --> 01:57:24.961
I think it should be
read into the record so

1564
01:57:24.962 --> 01:57:27.222
we may have no argument
about its translation.

1565
01:57:27.762 --> 01:57:34.710
That document is signed

1566
01:57:35.259 --> 01:57:36.549
by you. is it not?

1567
01:57:38.208 --> 01:57:39.208
Is that just correct?

1568
01:57:40.107 --> 01:57:41.667
Please correct me if I am wrong.

1569
01:57:44.736 --> 01:57:48.194
Supplementing the task that
was assigned to you on 1-24-1939.

1570
01:57:49.204 --> 01:57:50.693
which dealt with arriving at

1571
01:57:51.648 --> 01:57:54.632
through furtherance of immigration
and. in fact. the evacuation.

1572
01:57:55.052 --> 01:57:58.850
A solution of the Jewish problem
as advantageous as possible.

1573
01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:00.070
I hereby charge you

1574
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:02.742
with making all
necessary preparations in

1575
01:58:02.743 --> 01:58:05.388
regards to organizational
and financial matters

1576
01:58:06.088 --> 01:58:07.087
for bringing about

1577
01:58:08.287 --> 01:58:09.526
a final solution

1578
01:58:10.426 --> 01:58:11.526
of the Jewish question.

1579
01:58:12.865 --> 01:58:13.865
He's got them.

1580
01:58:17.003 --> 01:58:18.103
Am I correct so far?

1581
01:58:20.372 --> 01:58:22.662
No. your translation
is not correct.

1582
01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:28.379
Then please give
us your translation.

1583
01:58:33.517 --> 01:58:36.077
Supplementing the
task which was entrusted

1584
01:58:36.856 --> 01:58:41.314
to you in the decree
dated January 21. 1939

1585
01:58:41.315 --> 01:58:44.713
to solve the Jewish question
by immigration and evacuation

1586
01:58:45.013 --> 01:58:47.472
in the most favorable way possible.

1587
01:58:49.751 --> 01:58:51.090
Given present conditions.

1588
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:52.610
I hereby commission you

1589
01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:56.286
to carry out all necessary
preparations with regard to

1590
01:58:56.287 --> 01:58:59.787
organizational substantive
and financial viewpoints.

1591
01:59:01.227 --> 01:59:04.385
Now. here is the sentence

1592
01:59:04.885 --> 01:59:08.004
for a complete solution.

1593
01:59:08.499 --> 01:59:09.643
not a final solution.

1594
01:59:10.403 --> 01:59:11.643
for a total solution

1595
01:59:11.922 --> 01:59:13.342
of the Jewish question.

1596
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:19.050
A complete and total solution.

1597
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:21.369
Complete and total. yeah.

1598
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:26.608
A complete and total solution you
wanted the chief of the SS to enact.

1599
01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:30.136
Yeah. but I would like
to make an explanation.

1600
01:59:31.185 --> 01:59:32.185
Oh. please do.

1601
01:59:34.924 --> 01:59:35.923
I sent this letter

1602
01:59:36.398 --> 01:59:38.642
to Himmler and to Heydrich

1603
01:59:39.962 --> 01:59:45.170
because it was some 18 months now since the
declaration of the 24th of January. 1939

1604
01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:48.679
and Heydrich had
achieved very little.

1605
01:59:49.318 --> 01:59:53.518
So I charged him to accelerate the task of
dealing with the immigration of the Jews.

1606
01:59:56.875 --> 01:59:58.215
Immigration. you contend

1607
01:59:59.324 --> 02:00:00.374
was about immigration?

1608
02:00:01.833 --> 02:00:04.153
It says so in the first line.

1609
02:00:13.819 --> 02:00:15.598
That's just the first sentence.

1610
02:00:15.818 --> 02:00:18.217
The letter goes on
to state My desire

1611
02:00:19.567 --> 02:00:22.036
for a complete solution
to the Jewish problem

1612
02:00:22.885 --> 02:00:25.879
and an end to their
financial influence by

1613
02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:29.033
their emigration and
evacuation from Germany.

1614
02:00:31.437 --> 02:00:34.691
It is in this document
that you present to me.

1615
02:00:46.376 --> 02:00:49.575
Are there any more questions
for the witness. Justice Jackson?

1616
02:00:58.212 --> 02:00:59.212
Mr. Justice.

1617
02:00:59.891 --> 02:01:01.251
is the witness excused?

1618
02:01:08.863 --> 02:01:09.863
I have a question.

1619
02:01:16.355 --> 02:01:19.438
The tribunal was under
the impression the American

1620
02:01:19.439 --> 02:01:22.873
prosecutor would be
examining this witness today.

1621
02:01:24.252 --> 02:01:25.532
The United States is always

1622
02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:29.271
happy to hear from our distinguished
colleague from Great Britain.

1623
02:01:39.306 --> 02:01:41.086
It won't take more than a moment.

1624
02:01:42.805 --> 02:01:48.203
You've implied to this court that you lost
some influence with Adolf Hitler in 1942.

1625
02:01:48.383 --> 02:01:49.382
Is that correct?

1626
02:01:50.122 --> 02:01:52.681
I believe this to be the case. yes.

1627
02:01:52.961 --> 02:01:56.300
But you were still Reichsmarshal
of Germany in 1942.

1628
02:01:57.464 --> 02:01:59.459
Hitler's successor. yes?

1629
02:02:01.888 --> 02:02:04.057
Yes. I was the Reichsmarschall.

1630
02:02:05.316 --> 02:02:07.875
And you're telling me that
you were totally unaware

1631
02:02:08.275 --> 02:02:11.044
that three million Jews
were murdered in 1942?

1632
02:02:17.052 --> 02:02:18.551
I was unaware of this.

1633
02:02:19.051 --> 02:02:20.051
In 1943.

1634
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:22.430
at least 800.000 Jews

1635
02:02:23.230 --> 02:02:24.469
were executed in the camps.

1636
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:25.849
You were still Reichsmarshal

1637
02:02:26.373 --> 02:02:27.948
in 1943. is that correct?

1638
02:02:30.087 --> 02:02:31.087
That is correct.

1639
02:02:31.766 --> 02:02:32.766
In 1944.

1640
02:02:33.426 --> 02:02:35.325
an additional 800.000 Jews

1641
02:02:35.925 --> 02:02:36.924
died in the camps.

1642
02:02:37.384 --> 02:02:38.604
You were still Reichsmarshal

1643
02:02:39.243 --> 02:02:40.603
in 1944. is that correct?

1644
02:02:42.222 --> 02:02:43.222
That is correct.

1645
02:02:43.562 --> 02:02:44.621
In 1945.

1646
02:02:45.801 --> 02:02:47.320
250.000.

1647
02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:48.800
an estimated

1648
02:02:49.230 --> 02:02:50.879
six million Jews in total.

1649
02:02:51.659 --> 02:02:53.578
as well as Soviet and Polish citizens.

1650
02:02:54.658 --> 02:02:55.657
Romani people.

1651
02:02:56.217 --> 02:02:58.436
artists. scientists. writers.

1652
02:02:58.676 --> 02:02:59.756
journalists. photographers.

1653
02:03:00.275 --> 02:03:01.875
filmmakers. people killed.

1654
02:03:02.415 --> 02:03:03.414
not in combat.

1655
02:03:04.014 --> 02:03:05.613
not in enemy fire.

1656
02:03:05.913 --> 02:03:08.612
but exterminated by the state of Germany.

1657
02:03:09.012 --> 02:03:12.371
The state which you
were the Reichsmarshal of.

1658
02:03:13.041 --> 02:03:15.490
the preeminent political
post of your country.

1659
02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:17.489
You contend

1660
02:03:18.693 --> 02:03:20.488
that you had no knowledge.

1661
02:03:26.555 --> 02:03:27.705
At least give me this.

1662
02:03:29.394 --> 02:03:31.184
Knowing what we know now.

1663
02:03:32.283 --> 02:03:33.423
knowing what happened

1664
02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.782
to six million Jews.

1665
02:03:35.962 --> 02:03:36.961
I have to ask.

1666
02:03:41.050 --> 02:03:42.289
would you still follow

1667
02:03:43.039 --> 02:03:44.848
the Fuhrer. Adolf Hitler?

1668
02:03:44.849 --> 02:03:45.849
Yeah.

1669
02:03:57.634 --> 02:03:58.633
Eiffel.

1670
02:04:02.382 --> 02:04:04.161
Order! Order!

1671
02:04:08.619 --> 02:04:09.619
Heil Hitler.

1672
02:04:12.438 --> 02:04:13.438
No further questions.

1673
02:04:21.524 --> 02:04:26.373
I think this is as good a place
as any to adjourn for the day.

1674
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:34.030
Oh. great.

1675
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:35.389
Absolutely great.

1676
02:04:37.408 --> 02:04:38.408
I survived.

1677
02:04:38.468 --> 02:04:39.468
You did.

1678
02:05:05.148 --> 02:05:06.227
You were right.

1679
02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:10.146
I couldn't beat him.

1680
02:05:11.165 --> 02:05:12.165
Not without help.

1681
02:05:13.365 --> 02:05:14.964
Gering cannot stand against the Fuhrer.

1682
02:05:15.224 --> 02:05:16.703
Invaluable information. doctor.

1683
02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:21.312
So what now?

1684
02:05:23.171 --> 02:05:25.890
As Gering falls. so do they all.

1685
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:27.869
We'll be okay.

1686
02:05:29.129 --> 02:05:30.128
Here.

1687
02:05:34.077 --> 02:05:35.076
You off?

1688
02:05:37.116 --> 02:05:39.255
One more thing you have to do.

1689
02:06:03.366 --> 02:06:04.605
You helped them. didn't you?

1690
02:06:06.045 --> 02:06:07.044
I did.

1691
02:06:09.063 --> 02:06:10.063
I'm leaving.

1692
02:06:12.182 --> 02:06:13.182
Leaving?

1693
02:06:14.941 --> 02:06:15.941
Going home.

1694
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:19.499
I've come to say goodbye.

1695
02:06:23.918 --> 02:06:25.117
What do we do now. doctor?

1696
02:06:27.406 --> 02:06:28.406
Do we shake hands?

1697
02:06:33.484 --> 02:06:35.123
I know we were friends. Douglas.

1698
02:06:38.052 --> 02:06:39.052
For a while.

1699
02:06:48.179 --> 02:06:49.178
Goodbye. Hermann.

1700
02:06:55.696 --> 02:06:57.575
Years from now.

1701
02:06:59.274 --> 02:07:01.094
happen to what you say about us.

1702
02:07:02.673 --> 02:07:04.312
Will you even acknowledge we were human?

1703
02:07:23.525 --> 02:07:28.963
The judgment of the International
Military Tribunal will now be read.

1704
02:07:30.143 --> 02:07:33.441
Each defendant will be addressed in turn.

1705
02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:37.760
Hermann Gering.

1706
02:07:38.379 --> 02:07:41.658
the evidence shows that after Hitler.

1707
02:07:42.358 --> 02:07:46.016
you were the most prominent
man in the Nazi regime.

1708
02:07:48.416 --> 02:07:51.734
Your guilt is unique in its enormity.

1709
02:07:52.734 --> 02:07:55.913
Your record discloses no excuses.

1710
02:07:58.232 --> 02:08:04.150
The International Military Tribunal
sentences you to death by hanging.

1711
02:08:15.835 --> 02:08:17.115
Rudolf Hess.

1712
02:08:17.754 --> 02:08:19.314
you are indicted.

1713
02:08:19.854 --> 02:08:26.191
The executions are
scheduled for midnight tonight.

1714
02:08:27.471 --> 02:08:33.651
In order to maintain discipline. the
prisoners will not be informed until 11.

1715
02:08:34.011 --> 02:08:38.466
45 pm. when they will be awakened
in their cells and offered last rites.

1716
02:08:39.226 --> 02:08:43.445
At 8 pm. eight hand-picked
journalists will arrive at the prison.

1717
02:08:44.384 --> 02:08:47.943
Two French. two British.
two American. two Russian.

1718
02:08:49.242 --> 02:08:50.635
Lights out is at 9.

1719
02:08:51.315 --> 02:08:53.881
30. which is when the doctor
will do his normal final rounds.

1720
02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:59.099
Any prisoner requesting a sleep aid
will be given a placebo with baking soda.

1721
02:09:01.238 --> 02:09:02.737
At 10 o'clock.

1722
02:09:02.997 --> 02:09:05.616
we will bring the press
down to the gallows.

1723
02:09:05.796 --> 02:09:09.335
where I will brief them of the
final preparations for tonight.

1724
02:10:02.045 --> 02:10:04.854
The prisoners will be brought in one by one

1725
02:10:04.855 --> 02:10:08.192
and given the opportunity
to speak their last words.

1726
02:10:09.072 --> 02:10:10.072
They will then...

1727
02:10:19.578 --> 02:10:20.578
Who is it?

1728
02:10:20.737 --> 02:10:21.737
Gering. sir.

1729
02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:31.133
No. no. no. no!

1730
02:10:31.713 --> 02:10:33.669
No. you son of a bitch!
You don't get to do this!

1731
02:10:33.693 --> 02:10:36.711
He's dead. sir.
Sign. I... God damn it!

1732
02:10:47.027 --> 02:10:48.027
I'm sorry. sir.

1733
02:10:48.797 --> 02:10:49.896
We have a decision to make.

1734
02:10:50.996 --> 02:10:53.895
We can either scrub the
executions for tonight or proceed.

1735
02:10:54.814 --> 02:10:55.934
Let's just get home with it.

1736
02:10:56.414 --> 02:10:59.713
Sir. I... Stryker is refusing
to put his clothes on.

1737
02:10:59.714 --> 02:11:00.713
Come on.

1738
02:11:01.092 --> 02:11:04.051
Get out of here!

1739
02:11:04.711 --> 02:11:07.490
You fucking stupid whore!

1740
02:11:07.969 --> 02:11:09.429
Let him go! Let him go!

1741
02:11:21.344 --> 02:11:22.444
Julius.

1742
02:11:27.982 --> 02:11:28.981
Julius.

1743
02:11:41.657 --> 02:11:43.707
You... You...

1744
02:11:45.575 --> 02:11:47.125
You have been defended.

1745
02:11:59.110 --> 02:12:00.110
Come on.

1746
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:03.348
Let's do it together.

1747
02:12:05.528 --> 02:12:06.527
Come on.

1748
02:12:08.786 --> 02:12:09.786
Give me a shirt.

1749
02:13:09.513 --> 02:13:10.613
Ask him his name.

1750
02:13:11.812 --> 02:13:13.672
You know my name.

1751
02:13:14.551 --> 02:13:15.551
Any last words?

1752
02:13:16.730 --> 02:13:19.329
Cool him. feast 1946.

1753
02:13:20.909 --> 02:13:21.908
For she victim...

1754
02:13:22.748 --> 02:13:25.107
Benziadis Tagus Hagen!

1755
02:13:31.130 --> 02:13:36.793
Oh. damn it!

1756
02:13:40.731 --> 02:13:42.970
Why do you leave the bar?

1757
02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:29.840
Yes. Kay.

1758
02:15:45.614 --> 02:15:47.173
I have to be honest. Dr. Kelly.

1759
02:15:47.273 --> 02:15:50.332
I find some of the conclusions
in your book quite unbelievable.

1760
02:15:51.471 --> 02:15:55.870
You were dealing with the Nazis.
who you must admit are unique people.

1761
02:15:56.749 --> 02:15:58.349
They are not unique people.

1762
02:15:58.509 --> 02:16:02.787
There are people like the Nazis
in every country in the world today.

1763
02:16:02.788 --> 02:16:03.947
Not in America.

1764
02:16:04.446 --> 02:16:05.446
Yes. in America.

1765
02:16:06.486 --> 02:16:08.205
Their personality patterns are not obscure.

1766
02:16:08.985 --> 02:16:11.564
There are people who want to be in power.

1767
02:16:11.964 --> 02:16:15.902
And while you say they don't exist
here. I would say I'm quite certain

1768
02:16:15.903 --> 02:16:18.700
there are people in
America who would willingly

1769
02:16:18.712 --> 02:16:21.700
climb over the corpses
of half the American public

1770
02:16:21.701 --> 02:16:24.459
if they knew they could
gain control of the other half.

1771
02:16:24.619 --> 02:16:25.458
Doctor. please.

1772
02:16:25.538 --> 02:16:27.558
They stoke hatred.

1773
02:16:28.957 --> 02:16:32.796
It's what Hitler and Göring
did. and it is textbook.

1774
02:16:34.105 --> 02:16:35.974
And if you think the next time it happens

1775
02:16:36.554 --> 02:16:39.553
we're going to recognize it because
they're wearing scary uniforms.

1776
02:16:41.972 --> 02:16:43.711
you're out of your damn mind.

1777
02:16:49.719 --> 02:16:51.718
More with our panel when we return.

1778
02:16:55.557 --> 02:16:56.557
Yeah. uh-huh.

1779
02:16:57.656 --> 02:17:00.175
They're not going to invite
you to stay for the next segment.

1780
02:17:01.195 --> 02:17:02.194
Let's go.

1781
02:17:08.377 --> 02:17:13.270
And just so you know.

1782
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.388
trashing our country is probably
not the best way to sell your book.

1783
02:17:19.305 --> 02:18:19.766
Do you want subtitles for any video?
