2
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.799
I sense you. brother.

3
00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.499
Hiding...

4
00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.869
...Behind your cloak.

5
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.939
It is time to earn yours.

6
00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.299
Still too small to take me head on.

7
00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.159
Use the cave!

8
00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.229
You fight with rage.

9
00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.009
I fight like father.

10
00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.009
You are not father. you are Dek!

11
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.250
Do you yield?

12
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.590
Never!

13
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.510
Good.

14
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.540
I'm still alive. brother.

15
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.830
Still much to prove...

16
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.420
...to show who you are.

17
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.360
I am Yautja.

18
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.170
Not yet.

19
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.680
Are you holding your sword. Kwei?

20
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.650
No.

21
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.730
Pick it up!

22
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.000
You kept this toy?!

23
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.980
You remember what happened...

24
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.190
I lost my fang!

25
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.660
And you saved my life.

26
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.800
You protected me.

27
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.860
Come here.

28
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.090
Fixed it for you.

29
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.380
Don't blow yourself up.

30
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.010
Today you make a vow...

31
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.900
...as our ancestors did before you.

32
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.430
To earn your place in the clan...

33
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.930
...you must choose your prey.

34
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.860
Bring it home...

35
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.730
...or never return.

36
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.220
Wait — Go back!

37
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.970
Genna.

38
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.910
The death planet.

39
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.340
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

40
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.480
Even father fears it.

41
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.820
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

42
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.280
Father calls me the weakest...

43
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.380
...so I must kill the strongest.

44
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.100
Failure means death.

45
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.910
Then I will not fail.

46
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.020
I cannot allow it.

47
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.140
I make my vow.

48
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.780
I make my vow!

49
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.330
Father.

50
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.140
I welcome you with honor.

51
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.760
Why is it not done?

52
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.080
He deserves a hunt.

53
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.390
He is our clan's weakness....

54
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.850
...weaknesses must be culled.

55
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.710
He will bring home the Kalisk.

56
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.340
Foolishness.

57
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.340
He is a runt.

58
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.740
You should have done it as he slept.

59
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.220
Kill him!

60
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.280
Now!

61
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.740
He will only honor us in death.

62
00:15:19.439 --> 00:15:20.699
Father.

63
00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:34.619
Kwei?

64
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:37.979
Be brave. brother.

65
00:16:27.869 --> 00:16:29.089
Father!

66
00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:40.629
Kwei!!!

67
00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:56.959
To forgive weakness...

68
00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:01.599
...is to show weakness.

69
00:17:02.869 --> 00:17:04.799
No! Father. no!

70
00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.599
Get your sword!

71
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.249
Kwei!!!

72
00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:35.409
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

73
00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:47.759
Bring it home.

74
00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:52.299
Bring it home.

75
00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:56.919
For Kwei.

76
00:21:25.049 --> 00:21:26.729
Yautja!

77
00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:48.649
Yautja hunt alone.

78
00:25:13.609 --> 00:25:16.899
What happened to your legs?

79
00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:06.399
You have you seen the Kalisk?

80
00:26:54.859 --> 00:26:56.719
Useful...

81
00:26:56.739 --> 00:26:58.509
...like tool?

82
00:27:18.619 --> 00:27:20.839
I will use you. tool.

83
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.059
Don't want flies.

84
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.290
Name is Dek.

85
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.540
Now talk that way.

86
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.380
How long have you been here?

87
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.600
Who would come?

88
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.600
Sensitivity is weakness.

89
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.660
I must eat.

90
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.470
What is this creature?

91
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.820
Then it will be my food. too.

92
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.620
Quiet tool!

93
00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.210
You give up too easily.

94
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.480
Kalisk?

95
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.020
You give up too easily.

96
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.060
When I pierced its head with my sword

97
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:21.170
and its blood rushed down my face.

98
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.490
This flesh is not sweet.

99
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.620
I have no clan!

100
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.220
No clan.

101
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.870
I had a brother.

102
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.280
Father killed him.

103
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.590
Grief is weakness.

104
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.220
I am here for Kalisk.

105
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.610
Why are you here?

106
00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.780
You should be able to survive on your own.

107
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.990
Tessa is your sister.

108
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.980
And legs.

109
00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.040
Finding your sister

110
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.540
And legs.

111
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.630
The sun rises.

112
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.510
Let's go.

113
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.200
Yautja hunt alone.

114
00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.240
You're a tool.

115
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.760
We're not in the tree now.

116
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:10.980
Kalisk?

117
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.440
It drinks here.

118
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.600
It drinks here?

119
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.270
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

120
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.370
My brother was protecting me.

121
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.230
The clan can have no weakness.

122
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.530
I will show them strength.

123
00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.860
Wolf

124
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.940
This alpha must be a great killer.

125
00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.480
I will hunt it too.

126
00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.500
I see...

127
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:06.300
But I will be the alpha that kills the most.

128
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.670
The Kalish's den?

129
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.900
Who are they?

130
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.270
Easier to walk now.

131
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.780
No.

132
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:19.500
Easier for me to walk now.

133
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.930
I too will remember this...

134
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:42.880
...today I become Dek of the Yautja.

135
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.970
I will honor Kwei...

136
00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.920
When I bring the Kalisk home.

137
00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:56.080
Then I take revenge.

138
00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.660
You will be the first to see my trophy.

139
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:05.310
It is a great honor.

140
00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.710
For you.

141
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:19.010
What?

142
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.690
I came here for the Kalisk.

143
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:37.270
You want my trophy.

144
00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.040
Where is the Kalisk?

145
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.690
I use you. tool. You do not use me!

146
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.990
I use you!

147
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.240
Where is the Kalisk?

148
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.600
Then my death will be honorable.

149
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.400
Call your sister.

150
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.440
None can stop me.

151
00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.140
Save yourself. tool!

152
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.410
Tool. get these off!

153
01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.250
You are not Thia.

154
01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.740
Release me!

155
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.510
You are another broken tool!

156
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.540
Remove these!

157
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:47.290
Or I'll rip out your spine and crush your skull!

158
01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.780
You are nothing. A device.

159
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:06.730
Made by others to do their work for them.

160
01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.040
You betrayed me!

161
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.130
I trusted you.

162
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.460
Don't like these tools.

163
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.690
I'm sorry. My Sister is —

164
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.120
Don't like sister either.

165
01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.540
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

166
01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:31.370
He's asking about the device.

167
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:34.310
It's a children's toy.

168
01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.640
But say it's a map.

169
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:04.469
Tell tool to look inside.

170
01:12:12.999 --> 01:12:14.729
That was a toy for children?

171
01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:16.009
Yautja children!

172
01:12:22.499 --> 01:12:23.539
Run. Dek!

173
01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:27.949
Go...Go!

174
01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:41.839
<i>Enter destination coordinates. Kwei.</i>

175
01:15:16.749 --> 01:15:20.089
You saved me. brother.

176
01:15:23.339 --> 01:15:26.169
Wolf.

177
01:16:48.079 --> 01:16:49.679
Kalisk.

178
01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.039
Kalisk child.

179
01:20:45.054 --> 01:20:46.764
I came to rescue you.

180
01:20:55.664 --> 01:20:57.164
Wolf.

181
01:21:04.144 --> 01:21:06.074
Bone Bison.

182
01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:18.154
Not yet...

183
01:21:19.504 --> 01:21:20.874
Thia

184
01:21:39.454 --> 01:21:40.814
Kalisk!

185
01:21:46.734 --> 01:21:48.334
Kalish child!

186
01:21:52.354 --> 01:21:54.554
They have her mother!

187
01:22:11.544 --> 01:22:13.444
You free the Kalish.

188
01:22:13.614 --> 01:22:15.294
I get my trophy.

189
01:27:10.004 --> 01:27:11.704
You tell me.

190
01:33:01.344 --> 01:33:03.094
That's not yours.

191
01:33:36.994 --> 01:33:38.694
Not yet.

192
01:34:32.684 --> 01:34:34.604
You've come here for revenge?

193
01:34:35.404 --> 01:34:38.244
I've come for my cloak.

194
01:34:42.564 --> 01:34:44.124
What is this?

195
01:34:44.484 --> 01:34:47.324
I've completed my hunt.

196
01:34:47.884 --> 01:34:50.354
That is my trophy.

197
01:34:51.784 --> 01:34:53.474
You disgrace our clan...

198
01:34:53.594 --> 01:34:55.214
And so did Kwei.

199
01:34:57.904 --> 01:35:00.764
Get rid of him.

200
01:36:55.464 --> 01:37:00.074
Perhaps the right son did survive.

201
01:41:58.890 --> 01:42:00.550
Yield now...

202
01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.340
...and take your place in our clan.

203
01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.750
I have my own clan.

204
01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:29.270
No.

205
01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:35.330
It's my mother.

206
01:43:36.305 --> 01:44:36.243
