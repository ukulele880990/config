﻿1
00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.830
I sense you. brother.

2
00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.616
Hiding...

3
00:02:55.323 --> 00:02:57.323
...behind your cloak.

4
00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:01.803
It is time to earn yours.

5
00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:15.898
Still too small to take me head on.

6
00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:17.385
Use to cave!

7
00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.472
You fight with rage.

8
00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:35.552
I fight like father.

9
00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.265
You are not father. you are Dek!

10
00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:35.105
- Do you yield?
- Never!

11
00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.238
Good.

12
00:05:05.602 --> 00:05:08.462
I'm still alive. brother.

13
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.129
So much to prove...

14
00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:15.149
...to show who you are.

15
00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:18.096
I am Yautia.

16
00:05:19.943 --> 00:05:21.943
Not yet.

17
00:05:24.643 --> 00:05:26.566
Are you holding your sword. Kwei?

18
00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:29.813
No.

19
00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:32.113
Pick it up!

20
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.497
You kept this toy?!

21
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.357
You remember what happened...

22
00:06:07.037 --> 00:06:09.037
I lost my fang!

23
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.156
And you saved my life.

24
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.630
You protected me.

25
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.470
Come here.

26
00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:29.108
Fixed it for you.

27
00:06:32.234 --> 00:06:34.234
Don't blow yourself up.

28
00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:46.075
Today you make a vow...

29
00:06:52.943 --> 00:06:55.709
...as our ancestors did before you.

30
00:06:56.463 --> 00:06:59.649
To earn your place in the clan...

31
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.556
...you must choose your prey.

32
00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:05.903
Bring it home...

33
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.896
...or never return.

34
00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:19.174
Wait - Go back!

35
00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:25.250
Genna.

36
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.411
The death planet.

37
00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:30.757
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

38
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:38.565
Even father fears it.

39
00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:42.911
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

40
00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:46.198
Father calls me the weakest...

41
00:07:47.172 --> 00:07:50.385
...so I must kill the strongest.

42
00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:53.532
Failure means death.

43
00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:57.797
Then I will not fail.

44
00:07:59.443 --> 00:08:01.710
I cannot allow it.

45
00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.539
I make my vow.

46
00:08:09.873 --> 00:08:11.873
I make my vow!

47
00:09:07.682 --> 00:09:09.089
Father.

48
00:09:10.229 --> 00:09:12.522
I welcome you with honor.

49
00:09:25.452 --> 00:09:28.141
Why is it not done?

50
00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:31.442
He deserves a hunt.

51
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.670
You hear Yautja. others hear their
language.

52
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.250
Oh boy.

53
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.750
This isn't great for you.

54
00:22:37.493 --> 00:22:40.140
it waits for the needle to paralyze you...

55
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.600
Then eat you while you can't move.

56
00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:53.062
I could help you. but...

57
00:22:54.093 --> 00:22:55.313
I need a hand.

58
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160
Yautia hunt alone.

59
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.620
Yautja might hunt alone. but they die
alone. too.

60
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720
Kalisk.

61
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.060
You're hunting the Kalisk.

62
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.550
Gonna run faster!

63
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.570
It happens fast. huh?

64
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.810
If you had a weapon. you know.
I could use it.

65
00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.050
I could use it.

66
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.430
I could use it.

67
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.447
Throw me that and I could get you
the antidote.

68
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:57.581
Now or never.

69
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.970
Should be good as new.

70
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.390
The venom makes them bloom.

71
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.650
Also makes them a handy antidote.

72
00:25:17.002 --> 00:25:19.002
How about a lift?

73
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.530
Let's go.

74
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.637
Excuse you. sir.

75
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.806
What happened to your legs?

76
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120
I'm synthetic.

77
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.660
I was built and deployed by the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation for research.

78
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.580
Because their humans wouldn't last a day
on this planet.

79
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.600
We found that...

80
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.777
Look...

81
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.500
Many Yautja have come for the Great
Kalisk.

82
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.320
And none have survived it.

83
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.420
Or Genna.

84
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.290
I've seen the Kalisk.

85
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.710
I survived it.

86
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.170
Here's my proposal.

87
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.362
You take me along with you. and I'll guide
you to its den.

88
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:16.849
Once there. I get my legs. you get your
trophy. and everyone's a winner.

89
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.330
Deal?

90
00:26:20.658 --> 00:26:22.524
You have seen the Kalisk?

91
00:26:23.923 --> 00:26:24.923
Oh yeah.

92
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.620
I've seen the Kalisk.

93
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.700
Okay.

94
00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:46.655
Good luck with your journey.

95
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.526
I'm just gonna go on my journey.

96
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.546
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

97
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.593
Hey.

98
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.130
I've already shown you that I
could be useful to you.

99
00:27:11.343 --> 00:27:12.616
Useful...

100
00:27:13.117 --> 00:27:15.117
like tool?

101
00:27:18.171 --> 00:27:19.171
Exactly. like a tool.

102
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.210
The only way to survive Genna is to work
with it.

103
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.290
And I know how.

104
00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:30.270
And... with the right tool... you could
get the Kallusk.

105
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.350
You could be the first.

106
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.130
We'll delay your chish.

107
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.290
You delay!

108
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.290
You may call me thief!

109
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.190
What

110
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360
does the chewing?

111
00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.380
Your outside veins or your inside teeth?

112
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.140
Oh. what should I call you?

113
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.200
How fast were you going when your ship
crashed?

114
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.000
Faster than sublight speed?

115
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.740
We haven't cracked that yet.

116
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.820
Also. that plasma sword is interesting.

117
00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:15.455
Is it unique to your clan?

118
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.180
And what may I call you?

119
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.280
I call these Imbre Anguis.

120
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.160
They just want a snack.

121
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.650
You catch more flies with honey than you
do with vinegar.

122
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.790
Drink my wine.

123
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.990
Predatory organisms are my specific area
of expertise.

124
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.190
I've studied Yautja extensively.

125
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.330
It's an impressive culture.

126
00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.550
Here. ask me anything.

127
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.710
I bet I have the answer.

128
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:03.770
Very funny.

129
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.026
And you still haven't told me your name.

130
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.050
Nope.

131
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.080
What's going on?

132
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320
Just a generic.

133
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.190
Okay... sure.

134
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.360
Well. let's back up and start at the
beginning.

135
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.860
Together we're a 64-bore Stark.

136
00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.180
It's so beautiful.

137
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:04.800
After all the time I've been stuck here.
I never get tired of the view.

138
00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:22.180
A little pause... and we are back.

139
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:43.880
Tessa. our crew is made up entirely of
synths. but Tessa and I are special.

140
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.900
We have a higher sensitivity than the
others.

141
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:56.660
The sensitivity is what allows us to
understand the creatures on this planet.

142
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.840
We were created to work in tandem.

143
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.300
Me cooped up in the lab. Tessa out in the
field.

144
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.840
Until the wonderful day Tessa let me come
with her.

145
00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.940
We were exploring Genna.

146
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.500
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

147
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.220
Separated me... and us.

148
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:31.260
The last sound I remember hearing was
Tessa calling out my name.

149
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.590
Reaching for me.

150
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360
And then the Kalisk.

151
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.330
I didn't know what to do.

152
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.160
But I refuse to believe she's dead.

153
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.000
She's dead.

154
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:38.001
Tessa!

155
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.300
Tissa?

156
00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.140
Tissa?

157
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:42.460
Tissa?

158
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.540
Tissa?

159
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.700
Thea...

160
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:56.660
I'm so tired.

161
00:34:01.655 --> 00:34:03.960
Oh. a quick question.

162
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.800
What should I be doing?

163
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.700
Bone bison.

164
00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:16.375
Their callous food.

165
00:34:21.525 --> 00:34:22.525
So exciting.

166
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.040
Hunting with a yautja?

167
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.620
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

168
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.980
Just a warning.

169
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600
One.

170
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.260
Razor grass.

171
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.140
It'll cut you to ribbons.

172
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.420
We'll just go around.

173
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.660
We might not be alone in this hunt.

174
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.720
What an odd critter.

175
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:07.660
I've never seen you before.

176
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680
Yeah.

177
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.240
Thea.

178
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:15.690
Nice to meet you.

179
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.990
Looks like your competition is better.

180
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.570
Purple

181
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.610
up in these trees.

182
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:52.910
There are lunabugs.

183
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.970
Ah!

184
00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:55.610
Ah!

185
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.050
Ah!

186
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.130
Ah!

187
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:01.730
Ah!

188
00:36:01.731 --> 00:36:01.890
Ah!

189
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:02.390
Ah!

190
00:36:02.391 --> 00:36:02.790
Ah!

191
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:03.791
Ah!

192
00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:15.145
Coming up behind you.

193
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.340
Stronger than it looks.

194
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:42.880
Oh. Dak.

195
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.200
I'll show you.

196
00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:47.740
I'll show you.

197
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:56.850
I'll show you.

198
00:38:56.851 --> 00:38:58.170
I'll show you.

199
00:38:58.171 --> 00:40:03.990
I'll show you.

200
00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:04.670
I'll show you.

201
00:40:04.671 --> 00:40:05.671
That

202
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.260
was the best hunt I've ever been on.

203
00:40:40.565 --> 00:40:42.020
This is the dream team right here.

204
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.260
The dynamic three.

205
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.360
The dynamic trio.

206
00:40:44.655 --> 00:40:45.655
The dynamic trio!

207
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.040
Trio!

208
00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:48.481
Remember when we went down the tree?

209
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.780
That monster's mouth.

210
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:50.890
I mean...

211
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.480
Didn't smell great.

212
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.080
Didn't smell great.

213
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160
But...

214
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.480
We got him.

215
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.840
We got him.

216
00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.920
And then we met you.

217
00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.640
Our little. sweet little. little thing.

218
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.120
Thank you.

219
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.580
Seriously.

220
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.720
For that experience.

221
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120
Truly amazing.

222
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.400
Thrilling.

223
00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.520
Truly thrilling.

224
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.720
What was your favorite part?

225
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480
Cool.

226
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560
Aww.

227
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.150
No thanks.

228
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.490
I don't eat. but that's very sweet.

229
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.110
Good to know.

230
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.060
Woo!

231
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.360
Our little bud here looks hungry.

232
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:02.610
I think she's marking you.

233
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.460
She wants you to be a part of her clan.

234
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.980
Maybe she's lost.

235
00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.380
What do you mean?

236
00:42:13.535 --> 00:42:14.810
Don't all Yautja have family?

237
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:16.710
Not Yautmish.

238
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.090
So you never had anyone looking out for
you?

239
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:26.130
Doi-chit-tai-lut-chish.

240
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:27.910
Ha?

241
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:32.390
What happened to him?

242
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.630
A hwak-lut-in-jor.

243
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:41.870
You're grieving.

244
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.650
Ya-tay-is-ha-ru-n-na-m-ha.

245
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.890
You're here because you lost your brother.

246
00:42:53.285 --> 00:42:55.790
A-les-kin-t-wenn-yut-wun-chish.

247
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.050
Le-on-t-wenn-yut-wun-maw.

248
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.780
I'm here because traveling with you is the
best way to get back to Tessa.

249
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.701
When I was in that vulture's nest. I
was so afraid I would never see her again.

250
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.940
So then we swi-hu-law-a-ku-a.

251
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.200
I can survive on my own.

252
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.290
But who would want to survive on their
own?

253
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.020
Jelay-is-all-horror-Tessa.

254
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.720
Sister.

255
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.560
Huh.

256
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:43.770
Yeah.

257
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.140
I guess she is.

258
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.750
I have... a sister.

259
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:55.610
What a lovely thought.

260
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.630
I need to find her.

261
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:06.430
She-x-dwa-i-zul.

262
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.520
Excuse me?

263
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240
Nidh-lay-an-sa-ng-yan.

264
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.540
She-x-dwa-i-zul.

265
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.150
Was that a joke?

266
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.820
Anyway. back at weir.

267
00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:40.220
You do know that it's forft-ing.
right?

268
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.440
Uh. I don't.

269
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:49.520
I-I wanted to-I'm going to-

270
00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.440
Look like an old lady. polite.

271
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:55.960
Come out.

272
00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:56.961
There you are. okay.

273
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.180
The tree would have eaten us without her.

274
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.480
But we didn't.

275
00:49:33.481 --> 00:49:34.481
Bud saved us.

276
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.440
She spit on you to claim you as part of
her family.

277
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.580
Why'd your father kill your brother?

278
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.460
I don't know.

279
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.080
You're a pig. you're a pig.

280
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.240
You're a pig. you're a pig.

281
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.230
On Earth?

282
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:20.010
There's a predator known as the wolf.

283
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:21.870
It's a powerful creature.

284
00:50:25.435 --> 00:50:26.435
They hunt in packs.

285
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:28.470
They're very loyal.

286
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.670
The leader of the pack is the alpha.

287
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.960
Known as the most dominant.

288
00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:42.790
No.

289
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:44.830
The alpha...

290
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.230
isn't the wolf
who... kills the most.

291
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:53.230
The alpha is actually the one who best
protects the pack.

292
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:56.790
What is it?

293
00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.350
I don't know.

294
00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:02.650
I don't know.

295
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:39.180
I don't know.

296
00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.260
But I know it.

297
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:13.660
Waelin Utani Synths.

298
00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.540
The Calisk destroyed most of our mission
team.

299
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:25.410
Oh. there I am!

300
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.180
It's about to be.

301
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:21.040
Oh. of course.

302
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480
Right.

303
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.120
Thank you. Deck.

304
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.670
I'm never gonna forget this.

305
00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.600
You should... doubt this.

306
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.740
Deck. there's something I have to tell
you.

307
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:11.870
You need to leave now.

308
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.180
Location beacon activated.

309
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.700
I called Tessa.

310
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:19.790
The company is on its way.

311
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.620
You can't be here when they arrive.

312
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:28.120
So did I. Deck.

313
00:54:29.755 --> 00:54:31.640
The company sent us here to capture the
Calisk.

314
00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:32.660
The Calisk...

315
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:38.620
The Calisk.

316
00:54:44.115 --> 00:54:45.115
You can't kill it.

317
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.700
No. you can't.

318
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:47.860
No. you can't.

319
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.160
I'm sorry.

320
00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:51.650
You have to leave.

321
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.140
I needed you to... help bring me here.

322
00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.240
No. you can't.

323
00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:01.960
The Calisk is here.

324
00:55:01.961 --> 00:55:03.300
I'm trying to help you. Deck.

325
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.100
You think your brother saved your life
just so you could die here?

326
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.103
A big pause...

327
01:00:55.753 --> 01:01:01.680
and we are back.

328
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.180
I'm trying to help you. Deck.

329
01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.840
You think your brother saved your life
just so you could die here?

330
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.460
A little pause...
and we are back.

331
01:01:23.461 --> 01:01:24.760
The Yautja call their we.

332
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.820
Why were you spared?

333
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:47.870
I read Thea's logs.

334
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.630
You never told her why your brother
protected you.

335
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:05.750
That's correct.

336
01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.010
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

337
01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.690
It is a great honor... for you.

338
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600
Essa.

339
01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.820
I'm sorry.

340
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.120
You made it.

341
01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.180
We made it.

342
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:01.980
I've seen so much.

343
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.980
I have so much to tell you.

344
01:03:07.105 --> 01:03:08.820
I saw such incredible creatures.

345
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.260
The Yautja is a great traveling companion.

346
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760
Thea.

347
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.910
You were right about the Kallus.

348
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.300
This?

349
01:03:19.455 --> 01:03:20.455
Shy Wun Wun?

350
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.140
The creature is a regenerative miracle.

351
01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:27.000
Humanity will thank us.

352
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:31.750
We have the Kallus?

353
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.300
Yes.

354
01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.940
And Mother will be pleased with your
additional catch.

355
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.180
Additional catch?

356
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:45.930
Ah!

357
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.040
Ah!

358
01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.140
Ah!

359
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:48.380
Ah!

360
01:03:48.381 --> 01:03:49.381
Ah!

361
01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.560
Ah!

362
01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:54.480
Thanks criterion?

363
01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:04.420
All right. thank you.

364
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:15.890
I

365
01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.220
don't care if you don't give thanks.

366
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.840
I care about the

367
01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:36.930
Yautja from the bottom of my heart.

368
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:40.470
Good idea.

369
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:45.630
But it's so malformed.

370
01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.020
We're going to need a sample.

371
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.370
For research.

372
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.080
He was not the goal of our mission.

373
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.120
Tessa. he is deficient!

374
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.580
Tessa!

375
01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.010
Thea. this is what is asked of us.

376
01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:39.420
We can be more than what they ask of us.

377
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:44.950
What can we be?

378
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860
Sisters.

379
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600
Thea.

380
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.030
Do you know why Mother gave us feelings?

381
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.570
So we could understand the creatures on
this planet.

382
01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.690
And exploit them.

383
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:38.410
The Yautja is different.

384
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.100
He rescued me.

385
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:45.510
Like you rescued me.

386
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.050
I did not come here to rescue you.

387
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.050
I am completing our mission.

388
01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:57.290
When we first faced the Kallusk...

389
01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.090
I tried to protect you.

390
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.570
And that almost cost me everything.

391
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:09.010
What do you mean. Tessa?

392
01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:13.970
I almost made the same mistake the
Yautja's brother made.

393
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.650
The weak must be cold.

394
01:07:19.865 --> 01:07:22.750
And Thea. you are broken.

395
01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.330
Tessa. incoming message from Mother.

396
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.830
Motivate the Yautja to explain its
weapons.

397
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:37.130
And the unit?

398
01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.290
Box her up.

399
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.670
...

400
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:09.590
Why are you speaking its language?

401
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.200
You heard the orders.

402
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.400
I'm asking it to explain this device.

403
01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.400
What is the device?

404
01:08:34.065 --> 01:08:38.080
What did it say?

405
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.300
He says it's a map.

406
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.620
How does it work?

407
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:24.570
They shouldn't know.

408
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:02.640
You're a bald boy.

409
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:08.030
You're what?

410
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.920
F-tch.

411
01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.220
Nothing.

412
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:41.420
Only nothing.

413
01:13:43.745 --> 01:13:46.510
F-tch.

414
01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.820
F-tch.

415
01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040
F-tch.

416
01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:25.940
Hello. mother.

417
01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.160
Tessa.

418
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.440
We're about to load the Kallusk.

419
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:32.700
Priority one complete.

420
01:16:33.345 --> 01:16:34.760
The specimen has been acquired.

421
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400
Thank you. Tessa.

422
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.700
We truly are building a better world.

423
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:42.220
And what is the status of the Yautja?

424
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.400
The Yautja is a defective specimen.

425
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:49.180
What is the status of the Yautja?

426
01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.340
I'm sorry. mother.

427
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.680
The Yautja is dead.

428
01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.700
Then the Yautja is no longer a threat.

429
01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.720
The company will be pleased.

430
01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.820
Nicely done.

431
01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440
Oh. shit.

432
01:18:54.620 --> 01:19:44.710
Good job.

433
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:34.680
Don't move.

434
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:40.410
Deck?

435
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:41.830
What are you doing?

436
01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:42.890
What are you doing here?

437
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:50.590
You came back for me?

438
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.200
What exactly are you wearing?

439
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:12.435
Deck of the Yautja.

440
01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:18.531
You and I... are the... are...

441
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:21.070
The Yautja.

442
01:21:21.071 --> 01:21:21.450
We need to hurry.

443
01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:23.445
More of them will be here any minute.

444
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:31.390
What are you doing here?

445
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.390
Thanks. bud.

446
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:35.510
I'm good.

447
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:36.830
We need to go.

448
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:37.950
The Kallusk.

449
01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:41.090
Still. Deck?

450
01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:45.710
The Kallusk is dead.

451
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:47.590
The Kallusk is dead.

452
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:49.750
Bud?

453
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:58.550
Bud's its child?

454
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:08.470
What's the plan?

455
01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:15.210
You

456
01:22:20.805 --> 01:22:23.320
have 20 minutes to initiate launch.

457
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.400
Let's go hunt.

458
01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:33.620
Wait here.

459
01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:39.100
You roll in there. you're not exactly
gonna fit in.

460
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440
I have an idea.

461
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720
I see him.

462
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280
On me.

463
01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800
What are you doing?

464
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:34.270
What are you doing here?

465
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:35.870
I told you to get to the Yautja.

466
01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.480
You said to prepare the ship for takeoff
in 20 minutes.

467
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.960
Then what are you doing here?

468
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600
I gave you an order!

469
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:53.730
What should we do about the creature?

470
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.150
What creature?

471
01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.460
You should listen to her.

472
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:05.430
I should listen to her?

473
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480
I don't know.

474
01:26:10.905 --> 01:26:11.905
We need his eyes.

475
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:05.360
We need his eyes.

476
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:08.260
What is this?

477
01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:09.660
It's not a thing.

478
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.040
It's

479
01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:20.130
not a thing to listen to.

480
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:20.150
What is it for?

481
01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:20.430
I don't think this is for me.

482
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:20.470
No. I'm not.

483
01:29:20.471 --> 01:29:21.530
I need a warhead from you.

484
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:38.890
A warhead?

485
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:40.210
Death.

486
01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:15.010
Betrayed by my own... sister.

487
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.180
We're not sisters.

488
01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.160
Voyager...

489
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.080
...will turn the view.

490
01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:00.110
Genghrix...

491
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:02.930
...shix ya e'en istando.

492
01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:08.220
Nisi chai chi tai chi.

493
01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.460
Finally earned that cloak.

494
01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.800
Deck of the Yautja.

495
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:26.630
More friends of yours?

496
01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:28.630
My?

497
01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:33.840
We will.
