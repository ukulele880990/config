00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.166
[officer in Danish] Captain!

3
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.416
Captain!

4
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.666
Can we talk?

5
00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:10.500
[captain. softly] Hmm.

6
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:14.291
We must break through the ice.

7
00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.416
[officer] The men are hungry and exhausted.

8
00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.750
We cannot keep up this pace without consequence.

9
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.875
[captain] Listen up. men!

10
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.250
The more we delay the labor.

11
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.708
the firmer the grasp of the ice will become.

12
00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:34.708
The work continues.

13
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:36.666
Rotate each group.

14
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.875
[officer] Sir. with respect…

15
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.083
The men need assurances.

16
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.000
Assurances?

17
00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:44.833
Yes. that we will head back to St. Petersburg once we free the ship.

18
00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.625
They don't think we'll be seaworthy for long and they want to know--

19
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.083
[shouts] Listen up!

20
00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:55.875
It is neither your place. nor the officer here. to think anything…

21
00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.250
We signed up for a mission and we will see it to completion.

22
00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.750
We will reach the North Pole.

23
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.458
Is it understood?

24
00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.791
[officer] An explosion. Captain.

25
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.083
About two miles away.

26
00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.083
Get the men.

27
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.916
The sled dogs are unharmed.

28
00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.125
Then where does all this blood come from?

29
00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:17.791
-[man] Over here. Captain!

30
00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:20.250
A wounded man. he's lost a lot of blood.

31
00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.875

32
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.916
Wound to the shoulder. his leg is broken.

33
00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.291
Bear attack?

34
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:29.875
I don't think so. Captain.

35
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.708
Larsen. help me with his boot.

36
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:43.958
A prosthetic leg.

37
00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.333
Put him on the board.

38
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.458
Hurry! To the ship! Now!

39
00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.625
Larsen. that thing is coming.

40
00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.541
Ready the rifles!

41
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.000
On my command.

42
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.125
Aim!

43
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.875
Fire!

44
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:36.916
Next group!

45
00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.916
Fire!

46
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.458
All to the ship!!

47
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.375
[captain] Where is that man we brought onboard?

48
00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:20.416
Where?

49
00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:22.583
What is that thing? What does it want?

50
00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:50.750
[in Danish] The blunderbuss. Larsen. get the blunderbuss!

51
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.791
I killed it.

52
00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:22.708
I killed it.

53
00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.000
It's still alive!

54
00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:38.208
Ladder!

55
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:39.625
Pull up the ladder!

56
00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:58.583
Bring him to me!

57
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.541
How many shots are left?

58
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.583
One. but it can't kill it.

59
00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:21.666
I know.

60
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:23.875
I'm not aiming for him.

61
00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:18.791
Laudanum. to ease the pain. Drink it. Drink it.

62
00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:11.166
Victor!

63
00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:13.541
Victor!

64
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.250
Victor!

65
00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:24.041
Come down. your father is arriving.

66
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.750
Maman? Maman?

67
00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.333
I'm here. Mother.

68
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.083
I'm here.

69
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.041
Three…

70
00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:03.958
Two…

71
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:05.375
One…

72
00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:08.708
-That's impossible.

73
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:29.458
Father. It's Mother.

74
00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:16.166
Help him.

75
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.583
Help him!

76
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:45.291
You better come with me.

77
00:36:45.875 --> 00:36:47.333
[Anderson] Nothing.

78
00:36:47.416 --> 00:36:48.916
[Larsen] Sir. the watchman saw him.

79
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:51.458
Circling the ship. In the mist.

80
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:53.208
We all saw him drown.

81
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:54.416
Sir.

82
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.041
The men are terrified.

83
00:36:56.125 --> 00:36:58.458
They think that man should be surrendered to the ice

84
00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.708
and be done with this.

85
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:04.416
He is under my protection…

86
00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:08.375
and the protection of the Crown!

87
02:18:47.250 --> 02:18:48.916
Weapons down.

88
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.041
-Put the weapons down!
-I am responsible for my men.

89
02:18:52.458 --> 02:18:53.833
He can leave.

90
02:20:28.666 --> 02:20:29.750
We are free!

91
02:20:29.833 --> 02:20:31.083
We are free!

92
02:20:32.708 --> 02:20:33.791
Captain…

93
02:20:34.833 --> 02:20:36.208
What are your orders?

94
02:20:36.291 --> 02:20:37.750
Man the sails.

95
02:20:37.833 --> 02:20:38.791
Turn around.

96
02:20:38.875 --> 02:20:40.250
Do you want to tell the men?

97
02:20:40.833 --> 02:20:41.666
Men!

98
02:20:43.041 --> 02:20:44.125
We're sailing home!

99
02:20:44.833 --> 02:20:45.916
We're sailing home!
