00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.800
-[♪ Dramatic music playing]
-[Lester Coluca] Okay. Randall.

2
00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:09.843
today is gonna be a
big day of training.

3
00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:11.720
-Years of notes in here.
-What's that?

4
00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:14.140
[Lester] It's nothing. But if a
man comes in with a white gardenia.

5
00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:16.265
you don't talk to
him. Only me. okay?

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.643
You don't wanna get
involved. Got it?

7
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.645
[Mabel Mora] Guys. the
police report just came in.

8
00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.897
[Mabel. Oliver. and
Charles] Accidental death?

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.233
-You're the cuckoo chick!
-Cuckoo what?

10
00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.693
Lester likened all
the tenants to birds.

11
00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.112
Why does the shrimp
you're holding

12
00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.613
-have a fingernail?
-[screaming]

13
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.492
It looks like there's some sort
of green fungus on the nail.

14
00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.246
You've heard about my family's
ties to criminal activity.

15
00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.581
Can you explain what
you meant when you said

16
00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.418
that your missing husband has
everything to do with our building?

17
00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.297
We own Clean-Ups. the dry
cleaner in the Arconia.

18
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.966
How many guests
are we expecting?

19
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.177
Just Althea. Tim. and a
few friends from Bayport.

20
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.972
Nicky used to carry these decks
around everywhere he went.

21
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.683
There's a map on the back
of one of Nicky's cards.

22
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.184
-[key card beeping]
-[lock clicking]

23
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.939
[Oliver Putnam] Hello?

24
00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.567
[Oliver sighs]

25
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.110
-[Oliver screaming]
-[body thudding]

26
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.238
[Charles-Haden Savage] George
Bernard Shaw once said.

27
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.449
"In gambling. the many must lose

28
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.952
in order that the few may win."

29
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.162
He also said some
pro-Stalin things.

30
00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.374
and he was kind of anti-cow.
which isn't relevant here.

31
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.001
-Mabel. can we cut that?
-[Mabel] No.

32
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.127
[Charles] Okay. great.

33
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.839
At the onset of the 1910s.
the rise of the automobile

34
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.926
rendered the horse stables
under the Arconia obsolete.

35
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.888
It wasn't long before some of
New York's most infamous mobsters

36
00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:40.809
found a new. more lucrative
use for the space.

37
00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:44.062
By the 1920s. the mob
had secret gaming rooms

38
00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:45.272
all over the city.

39
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.025
and none played host
to more power players

40
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.526
than the Velvet Room.

41
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.736
For over a century.

42
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.073
some of the most consequential
decisions in the city were made here.

43
00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:56.199
Rumor has it.

44
00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:59.328
this is where the Empire State
Building contract was awarded.

45
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:03.165
where it was decided that bars
could stay open until 4:00 a.m..

46
00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.292
and where. at the last second.

47
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.878
it was changed from
"Zachary Taylor Island."

48
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.880
to "Roosevelt Island."

49
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:13.967
Even as the fashion. decor. and
clientele changed over the years.

50
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:17.638
one constant remained: the mob.

51
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.933
Everyone from Lucky Luciano
to John Gotti wielded power

52
00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:24.311
over the five boroughs
from this location.

53
00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.772
known to an elite few.

54
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.107
And that continues to this day.

55
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.111
I always assumed the
Velvet Room was a myth.

56
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.655
but it was right here all along.

57
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.615
How did I miss it?

58
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.284
Well. to be fair. it was
down a secret staircase

59
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:41.662
that only opened with
a magic deck of cards.

60
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.373
I wouldn't beat
yourself up too much.

61
00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:48.418
You know. this does make for a
good opening twist of our podcast.

62
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.629
Should I be videoing?
A lot of podcasts

63
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.381
-are doing video now.
-[groaning]

64
00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.799
Do you hear that?

65
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.969
-Is that...?
-[Oliver] Oh. my God. oh. my God!

66
00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.597
-Oliver. is that you?
-[Oliver] Mabel?

67
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.058
Are you okay? What's going on?

68
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:06.269
[Oliver] I'm in the dry cleaners.
I found Nicky Caccimelio.

69
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.480
Oh. great! Can you
keep him there?

70
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.148
[Oliver] Shouldn't be too hard.

71
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.692
He's dead!

-Ugh! Geez.
-Okay. okay. just stay calm.

and meet us at
Charles's apartment!

79
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.130
And Oliver. whatever you
do. don't touch the body!

80
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:37.259
The last thing you want is your
DNA all over a dead mobster's body.

81
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.387

[Mabel] Oh. my God. Oliver!

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.158
What part of "don't touch a dead
body" did you not understand?

127
00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.410
Well. I sneezed on him.

128
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.162
I'm allergic to gardenias
and Martinizing.

129
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.956
Look. I-I-I get
that this looks...

130

-Like you've lost your mind.
-Like you've committed a felony.

131

I was gonna go "A bit kooky."
but yes. those also work.

132
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.714
Oliver. what did you do?

133
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.091
It's really quite
simple. After sneezing.

134
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.926
I had to clean my
essence off him.

135
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.220
and then I blacked out.
and the next thing I know.

136
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:30.849
I am pushing a corpse
down 86th Street.

137
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:34.394
And no one noticed you with a dead
body. pushing it in a laundry cart?

138
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.688
Oh. please. this is Manhattan.
it didn't even crack

happening on the block.

140
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.026
But why'd you bring
him to my apartment?

141
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:44.112
Well. I... Obviously. I didn't
want a dead body in my apartment.

142
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.198
You only think of yourself.
This is so typical you.

143
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.743
I have never brought a
dead body to your home.

144
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:51.745
What is this?!

145
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.914
Well. you've implied I've done
it before. which I haven't!

146
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.040
Go fuck yourself!

147
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.843
Believe me. I've tried
that. it didn't work.

what we're all gonna look like.

153

No. no. No. no. not me.
I have a signed napkin

154

from the guy who did makeup
on Planet of the Apes.

matter how mangled it is.

-Right. right. right. right.

163

So. we need to get Oliver's
DNA off and put the body back

before they realize
we took it. Okay?

165

-Good plan. Yes.
-I hate this.

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.390
And it definitely didn't have
anything to do with the script.

679
00:30:50.474 --> 00:30:53.518
-Hmm.
-So. I sat her down.

680
00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:58.357
and I told her. "Sheena-baneena.
stop trying to be Chuck"

681
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.278
and start trying to be fillet
mignon." [snort-chuckling]

682
00:31:03.362 --> 00:31:05.739
And from then on.
the rest is history.

683
00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:08.033
So. the musical was a success?

684
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:09.117
I said it was history.

685
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:11.661
Point is. it's hard
to follow a legend.

686
00:31:11.745 --> 00:31:14.039
so stop trying to be Lester.

687
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:16.333
You can't be
somebody you're not.

688
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:18.752
I still have a lot of follow-up
questions about this musical.

689
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:20.879
but I think I get what
you're trying to say.

690
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.798
Thank you. Mr. Putnam.

691
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.133
And I don't care what you
say. you're a good guy.

692
00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:28.345
Ah. well. thank you.

693
00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:32.891
And. um. I know this
might be hard to believe.

694
00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:35.811
given my boyish
good looks. but. uh.

695
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:38.688
I've actually lived in this
building quite a while.

696
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:42.234
So. if you wanted. I
could try and help you

697
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:43.819
finish some of that training.

698
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:46.530
-Really?
-Yes.

699
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:49.199
A-Any question you
have. please come to me.

700
00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:52.661
Uh. I actually have a bunch of
questions. Can we start right now?

701
00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:55.872
No. Right now. I have to
take a very important nap.

702
00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:59.918
But. I would say any other time.

703
00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:01.920
I promise. I'm there for ya.

704
00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:05.966
-Thank you. Mr. Putnam.
-You got it.

Uh. this is anonymous

715
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:41.751
and I'm in Dr. Tidyman's trial group.
and I'd like to get the next four doses

[Mabel] It's good we're
getting here early.

00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:10.447
People get whole new identities
to hide from the mafia.

725
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.366
and we're breaking
laws to see them.

726

It's locked.

727

I discovered it opens
with a key card.

Yes. and Lester and Nicky
have both been here.

-You don't have to type that either.

Here. I got it.

755
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.493
Okay. so this is tech
billionaire Sebastian Steed.

756
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:40.495
-goes by "Bash."
-[Oliver] Yeah. yeah. yeah.

757
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:42.789
That's what I told you. The
guy who invented the thing.

758
00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:47.711
[whispering] Okay. so the
other guy is Jay Pflug.

759
00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:51.047
Heir of the Pflug pharma family.

760
00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:52.591
Oh. they make highly
addictive drugs

761
00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:54.217
that ruined a lot
of people's lives.

762
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:57.304
They also make my blood pressure
medication. so I'm conflicted.

763
00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:59.264
This is Camila White.

764
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:02.058
She owns half of
New York's hotels.

765
00:35:02.142 --> 00:35:04.936
And God. can she rock
a neutral cashmere.

766
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.565
She's like the human incarnation
of a Nancy Meyers kitchen.

Guys. guys. they're
all billionaires.

is the new mob of New York.

recorded that. Okay.

so too have those in power.

775

The "mafia." as we once
knew them. may be no more.

776
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.964
but the idea of many losing

777
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:37.010
in order for an elite few to
win has never been more true.

778
00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:40.347
Gone are the velour
tracksuits and gold chains.

779
