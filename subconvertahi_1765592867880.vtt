00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.691
Oh! Sorry. Uncle Rick.

3
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:06.901
Excuse me.

4
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.916
What is this?

5
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.084
Like I said.
we're being played.

6
00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:25.169
Now. pay up.

7
00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.547
How'd you even find
this stuff?

8
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.758
I can find anything or anyone.

9
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.551
Then why can't you find
your dad?

10
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.136
Hilarious. Gene.

11
00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.640
Look. I don't know
what all this stuff is.

12
00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:39.767
but Santa is coming tonight.

13
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.685
Okay. can we talk
about that for a minute?

14
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:42.978
Jack O'Malley.

15
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.231
Kids. go downstairs.

16
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.108
Not you.

17
00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.488
What are you doing. pal?

18
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:55.282
Look. we love having you here
for the holidays.

19
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.034
But what are you telling
your cousins?

20
00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.619
The cold hard truth.

21
00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:01.747
"Cold hard truth"?

22
00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:06.835
Jack. these are presents. yes.
But these aren't Santa's presents.

23
00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.964
Right. Because Santa Claus
hasn't been here yet.

24
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:12.508
It's Christmas Eve. He's coming tonight.

25
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.386
He's coming here.

26
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.846
To this house. Tonight.

27
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.367
- That's what you're telling me?
- That's what I'm telling you.

28
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.560
And he's also going
to every other house in the world.

29
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:27.856
on the same night. using flying reindeer
for transportation?

30
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.024
Yes. Jack.

31
00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.236
And what fuels
a flying reindeer exactly?

32
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990
Probably. carrots.

33
00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.575
Okay. look.
I don't know exactly how it works.

34
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:44.456
All I know is. when we wake up tomorrow.
Santa will have been here.

35
00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.711
All right. let's go.

36
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.838
You don't wanna get
on The Naughty List. do you?

37
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:55.009
Honestly. Uncle Rick.
I'm not that worried about it.

38
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.072
Christine!
Triple shot Americano!

39
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.644
<i>Jack O'Malley!
I don't believe it.</i>

40
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.396
Lenny. you miss me?

41
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.482
<i>- Where's my money?</i>
- I'm getting you your money.

42
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.208
I told you I'm gonna
get you your money.

43
00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:54.777
I'm on a job right now.

44
00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:56.945
In fact. I'm planning on doubling it.

45
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.906
You still got Morris at plus 300?

46
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:00.783
<i>Morris? That stiff?</i>

47
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.618
Put me down for 25K.

48
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.286
<i>You got a lot of balls. O'Malley.</i>

49
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.914
I know. Brains too.
It doesn't seem fair. does it?

50
00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:20.636
All right.

51
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.181
Good. Feel it. Feel the burn.

52
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.810
Seven. Here we go. And switch.

53
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:29.978
Eight.

54
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.335
Push it. Gotta move.
Come on now.

55
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.498
- Give it all you got.
- Oh.

56
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.463
Gosh! Fire!

57
00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:57.714
Look. fire!

58
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.052
Grab your stuff.

59
00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:13.689
There's a fire.

60
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.027
What are you looking at?

61
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.200
Gift card! Gift card. Gift card.

62
00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:05.634
<i>Ultimate Vampire Assassin 4</i>
for the Switch. Got it.

63
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.177
Are you gonna write that down?

64
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.972
No. Steel trap.

65
00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:29.866
Hey. Fred.

66
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.869
We got a 5'11 male grown-up
hovering by the scented candles.

67
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:33.996
Keep an eye out.

68
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.706
<i>Copy. Chief.
I got eyes on him.</i>

69
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:37.958
Hi. Santa.

70
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.418
We made cookies for you.

71
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.669
Thank you.

72
00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.882
Chocolate chip
and snickerdoodle.

73
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.635
I love snickerdoodle.
How'd you know?

74
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:50.345
- I made them myself.
- I helped.

75
00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:52.865
You know what? I've been
meaning to talk to you guys.

76
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:53.724
Come here a minute.

77
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.475
We're live!
Yo. it's your boy. Beef Stew.

78
00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.478
And we're here at Christmas
at the mall

79
00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:00.772
with the boy. the GOAT. Santa.

80
00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:03.275
And we're gonna get him
to put on Stew Crew T-shirt.

81
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.943
Sir. you can't cut the line.

82
00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:06.862
Aw. what's the matter. big dude?

83
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.197
You don't wanna show
some Christmas love to the Beef?

84
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:11.116
These kids have been waiting
a long time.

85
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.909
Look. man.
It'll take two minutes.

86
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:14.262
He puts on the shirt
and he says.

87
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:15.287
"Now we beefin'!"

88
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.039
- Sir.
- I'm a big deal.

89
00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.333
I have over 3.000 followers.

90
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:20.959
I'm gonna make your boy famous.

91
00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:22.627
Just got to put the shirt on.

92
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.421
He's already quite famous.

93
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.964
- Ah. Don't be a total...
- Sir.

94
00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:29.259
You can't cut the line.

95
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.556
Have I made myself clear?

96
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.767
Yes. very clear.

97
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.270
Now. I wish you
a Merry Christmas.

98
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.399
Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna go. I'm... Yep.

99
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.693
Now. you guys have

100
00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:49.071
a very important appointment
with Santa.

101
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.240
Man. I needed that.

102
00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:54.493
So important to get out.
talk to the kids.

103
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.744
Best part of the job.

104
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:56.827
It's Santa.

105
00:08:57.371 --> 00:08:59.790
Nothing like a crowded mall
two days before Christmas.

106
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.334
Yo. Santa-man!
Merry Christmas.

107
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.920
Merry Christmas. pal!

108
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.068
Tell me you're not
gonna miss this.

109
00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:12.844
God! What do you mean you're
sold out of essential oils?

110
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:14.930
I'm gonna bash
someone's skull in.

111
00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.223
I'm not gonna miss this.

112
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.392
Approaching ground floor.

113
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.726
Let's heat up Ice Breaker.

114
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.230
Freddy. secondary array.
180 degree spread. Go!

115

118
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:30.987
Thanks. Ginerva.

119

Sure thing. Red.

120
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.241
Carl. you got
any milk up there?

121
00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:35.325
Of course. Red.

122
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.744
I always love
coming to Philly.

123
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.331
You think we have time
to stop for a cheesesteak?

124
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.921
It won't be the same
without you. Cal.

125
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.757
It will be exactly the same
without me.

126
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.761
Stubborn pain in the butt.

127
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.162
General.

128
00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.872
Red. Good to see you.

129
00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.040
- Successful excursion?
- Yes. sir.

130

131
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.378
Thank you.

132
00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.931
Good evening. ladies.

133
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.817
What are you so excited about?

134
00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.697
Oh. Of course.
your boyfriend's here.

135
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.368
Uh. hey. girls.

136
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.788
Okay. okay.

137
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.208
Of course. I didn't forget.

138
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.169
Yes. I brought extra.

139
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.338
Who's hungry?

140
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:13.590
There we go.

141
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.347
Cal!

142
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.640
Come on. man!

143
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.724

Red One.
you are clear for take-off.

145
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.632
All right. ladies.

146
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.176
Let's go home.

147
00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:36.673
Thanks for the escort. fellas.

Come on. Morris.

151
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.180
<i>Go ahead.</i>

152
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.306
I got it.

153
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.229
I don't know what the hell
it is. but I got it.

154
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:29.643
<i>Send the coordinates.</i>

155
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.687
Well. why don't you send
something my way first?

156
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.815
<i>Wiring the first half now.</i>

157
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.984
<i>The rest.
when the data is verified.</i>

158
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.072
Pleasure doing business
with you.

159
00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.740
Yes! Yes! Yes!

160
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.659
<i>He's got Morris in the corner.</i>

161
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:46.826
<i>He staggered him.</i>

162
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.203
<i>- He's in the corner!</i>
- No.

163
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.289
- No!
<i>- Morris is down!</i>

164
00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.584
No! Oh. my God!

165
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.157
Home. sweet home.

166
00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.356
Whoa. ladies.

167
00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:16.958
Red. welcome back.

168
00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.084
Thank you.

169
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.172
Where's the missus?

170
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.549
I think she's in deliverables.

171
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.760
I'm... I'm right here!

172
00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.511
Deliverables was
a half hour ago.

173
00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.306
Larry. this is going
to Bermuda.

174
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.183
Copy that. Bermuda.

175
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.684
Garcia.

176
00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.644
Welcome back. Chief.

177
00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:37.645
What did I miss?

178
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.023
Nothing. Everyone's working.

179
00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.108
There's a bottleneck
in Ribbons.

180
00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:43.234
Phil is blaming Wrapping.

181
00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.361
Wrapping says Phil
is being overdramatic.

182
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.988
Everybody's feeling the heat.

183
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.198
All right. I'll talk to him.

184
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.324
Please.

185
00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:51.201
Phil's driving everybody nuts.

186
00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.953
Phil in Ribbons
is having a total meltdown.

187
00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.197
Yeah. maybe it's time to find

188
00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.831
a less stressful spot
for Phil.

189
00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:57.916
I don't know. Tinsel?

190
00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.375
No. Phil out of Ribbons?

191
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.668
Just a thought.

192
00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.170
He's got a dog named Ribbons.

193
00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.253
Yeah. right.

194
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.299
495. 496.

195
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.218
497. 498.

196
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.928
499. 500.

197
00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.097
In five minutes. Not bad.

198
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.390
Yeah. getting warmed up.

199
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.726
All right. I'm gonna run
the simulation model

200
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.479
on Belgium and Holland again.
just to be safe.

201
00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:20.664
- Thank you. sweetie.
- All right.

202
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:21.689
If you need me. yell.

203
00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:23.775
Hey. Cal. Jump in there.

204
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.277
Get him ready. okay?
It's almost showtime.

205
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:27.403
Yes. ma'am. Will do.

206
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.673
- Hey. boss.
- Cal.

207
00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.395
- Give me a spot. huh?
- You got it.

208
00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:09.737
Up.

209
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.533
Tell me why.

210
00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:16.870
Time for a change. Nick.

211
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.497
- It's like I told you.
- Yeah. I heard you.

212
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.417
And I'll respect your decision.
but I want to know why.

213
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:24.878
- Let's go heavy.
- Yep. Got it.

214
00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:31.926
Looking strong.

215
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.928
We work for the kids. Cal.

216
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.140
We do it for them.
And I know you love that.

217
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.600
You live for that.

218
00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.562
So. what's going on here?

219
00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.230
I love the kids.

220
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.067
It's the grown-ups
that are killing me.

221
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.738
Go on.

222
00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:55.158
- The List.
- What about The List?

223
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.660
We're up almost 22%.
year over year.

224
00:17:57.744 --> 00:17:59.287
I'm aware of the numbers. Cal.

225
00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:01.289
What are you getting at?

226
00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.042
For the first time ever.

227
00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.419
more people are on
the Naughty List than not.

228
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.546
And it's like
they don't even care.

229
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.841
So much bad behavior
out there.

230
00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.176
everywhere you look.

231
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.305
Uh. you say it
all the time. Nick.

232
00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.727
"We choose every day
who we want to be.

233
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.021
With big decisions
and little ones.

234
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.065
And every
one of them matters."

235
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.527
But I look around

236
00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.488
and they act
like none of it matters.

237
00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:37.367
If nothing matters to them.

238
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.203
it seems to me they need us
now more than ever.

239
00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:44.666
That's why
there's only one you.

240
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:49.504
And no one with my doubts
should be so close to you.

241
00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:52.048
You need somebody younger.

242
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.175
Someone 300 years old.
in their prime.

243
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.843
who wants to change things.

244
00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.097
Not our job
to change people. Cal.

245
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.807
People change themselves.

246
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.309
We just show 'em
that we believe in 'em.

247
00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.394
All of 'em.

248
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:08.648
'Cause we know who
they really are. down deep.

249
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:13.194
We know that somewhere
inside every lost grown-up

250
00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.072
is the kid they once were.

251
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.034
Our gift
is that we can see that.

252
00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.202
even when they can't.

253
00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.248
We work for the kids. Cal.

254
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.918
Even when
they're not kids anymore.

255
00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.674
I'm just having
a really hard time seeing it.

256
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.136
And that's why.

257
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.058
Let's have a cookie.

258
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.853
The answer to everything.

259
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.439
Got to carb up.

260
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.065
- You know. I burn about...
- You burn

261
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.443
430 million calories
every Christmas Eve.

262
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.695
- Yep.
- Yes. I know.

263
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.573
One last ride. huh?

264
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.075
One last ride.

265
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:10.460
Mm.

266
00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:40.822
Here!

267
00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.326
Get to it. lads.

268
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.314
Alpha check. It's Drift.

269
00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.984
Looks like a light just fried
on the anterior West face.

270
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.402
up around Mail Room 19-B.

271
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:00.611
Anyone up there?

272
00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.280
<i>Yeah. this is Jeff in Maintenance.</i>

273
00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:04.115
<i>You don't miss a thing.
Commander.</i>

274
00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.825
<i>- I'll check it out.</i>
- Thanks. Jeff.

275
00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.560
Hey. Jeff. looks like we got
a few more of 'em too.

276
00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:15.877
What's going on up there?

277
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.255
Jeff?

278
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.424
Jeff. do you copy?

279
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.802
Who's with Red?

280
00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:26.512
<i>Arthur? Is he still with you?</i>

281
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:27.596
Negative. Chief.

282
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.015
<i>Kenny. do you have him?</i>

283
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.599
Not in the gym.

284
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.936
Who's with Red?

285
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.563
Gorman.
are you in the residence?

286
00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:36.772
<i>Finkle just took over.</i>

287
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:38.024
Finkle?

288
00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:39.107
Finkle?

289
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.694
I need eyes on Red now!

290
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:45.448

Nick. Nick!

307
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:23.653
Breach!

308
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:25.738
- We have a breach!
- Does anyone have eyes?

309
00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:45.925
Code Green! Code Green!
Full lockdown!

310
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.803
Armored snowcat heading north!

311
00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:50.012
Copy that.

312
00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:52.515
- Locating.
- Who has eyes?

313
00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.016
- Just turned right on Pine.
- Copy.

Street unit six. deploy.

00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:11.075
Box them in.

317
00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:20.710
Agents down.

318
00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:34.098
Raise barrier 72!

319
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.433
Raising 72.

320
00:25:17.475 --> 00:25:19.268
Snowcat just turned left on Candlestick.

321
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:27.360
There's a hole in the dome.

322
00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:42.035
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

323
00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:43.853
- There's been a breach. Director.
<i>- I know.</i>

324
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.647
Red has been taken.

325
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.065
<i>What?</i>

326
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:50.025
<i>- Where's Cal?</i>
- I'm right here.

327
00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:51.902
<i>Cal. what happened?
Who could have done this?</i>

328
00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:52.986
Zoe. I don't know.

329
00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.363
<i>We're 24 hours to Christmas Eve.</i>

330
00:26:54.447 --> 00:26:56.031
<i>- We cannot...</i>
- Yes. I'm well aware.

331
00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:58.075
<i>Okay.</i>

332
00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.369
<i>Okay. let's take a deep breath.</i>

333
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:03.205
<i>Start from the beginning.</i>

334
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.876
They cut a hole in the CF Dome
using an atomic plasma torch.

335
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.043
From the footprints.

336
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:10.421
I'd say there's eight
to ten of them. Human.

337
00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:12.381
They rolled in
on a remote armored snowcat.

338
00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:13.966
which they used as a diversion

339
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:15.009
before they blasted out of here

340
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.510
in a NORAD-blind cargo jet.

341
00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:17.678
<i>Good God. Cal.</i>

342
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.263
I'm gonna find him. Zoe.

343
00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:21.207
<i>We're gonna work together on this.</i>

344
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:23.743
<i>We were just told
that someone hacked</i>

345
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:26.228
<i>the Intercontinental Seismic
Surveillance System.</i>

346
00:27:26.312 --> 00:27:27.372
<i>I don't know if it's related.</i>

347
00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:28.814
<i>but if someone knew
where to look.</i>

348
00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:31.108
<i>that's the only vulnerability
in the cloaking.</i>

349
00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:32.109
Who?

350
00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:33.360
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

351
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:34.713
<i>The Trolls are scouring the web.</i>

352
00:27:34.737 --> 00:27:36.530
Name and address.

353
00:27:36.614 --> 00:27:37.781
<i>They're working on it.</i>

354
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:40.367
Then tell them to work faster.
We don't have time for this.

355
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:42.703
<i>Director! The Trolls have a trace.</i>

356
00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:44.038
<i>Patch them in.</i>

357
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:45.581
<i>What have you got?</i>

358
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.917
<i>We traced the relays.
Looks like the Wolf.</i>

359
00:27:50.127 --> 00:27:52.171
<i>- The Wolf.</i>
- Who the hell is the Wolf?

360
00:27:53.756 --> 00:27:55.633
<i>Mercenary. Bounty hunter.</i>

361
00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:57.092
<i>Works for the highest bidder.</i>

362
00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:58.969
<i>A ghost on the dark web.</i>

363
00:27:59.053 --> 00:28:00.888
<i>FBI's been trying
to recruit him for years.</i>

364
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:02.139
<i>but he's a freelancer.</i>

365
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:05.643
<i>He's probably
the best tracker in the world.</i>

366
00:28:06.644 --> 00:28:07.811
<i>The guy's a legend.</i>

367
00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:22.867
What?

368
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.953
Nice.

369
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.829
- Are you in town?
<i>- That depends.</i>

370
00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:26.956
What do you want?

371
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:29.333
I need you to do me a favor
and go pick up Dylan.

372
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.293
I'm right in the middle
of something important.

373
00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:32.562
This isn't a good time for me.

374
00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:33.754
<i>Yeah. me either.</i>

375
00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:35.774
I have two mothers-to-be
with weakening contractions

376
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.067
and labor that's not progressing.

377
00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:38.091
And Craig's out of town.

378
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:39.552
Liv.

379
00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:40.862
Dylan got in trouble at school.

380
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.030
I just need you
to go pick him up

381
00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:43.156
and drop him off at my place.

382
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.473
- Liv.
<i>- Jack.</i>

383
00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:46.141
I'm stuck at work and Craig's away.

384
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:48.394
So just do me a favor
and go pick up your kid.

385
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:06.078
I got it. I got it. I got it.

386
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.956
Hey. buddy.

387
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.004
- Hey. you got any aspirin?
- What?

388
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:16.964
No.

389
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:20.509
I've got to get
something in my stomach.

390
00:29:20.593 --> 00:29:22.386
- You want a churro?
- No.

391
00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:25.556
Shut up!

392
00:29:28.058 --> 00:29:30.185
Hey. man. Can I get two?

393
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:31.604
I don't want a churro.

394
00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:33.355
I heard you. They're for me.

395
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:37.443
So what are they saying you did?

396
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:39.820
Tampered with
the school's attendance records.

397
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:40.903
Which I did.

398
00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:42.656
Allegedly.

399
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:43.824
Never admit that.

400
00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:47.161
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Yeah. yeah.

401
00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:53.059
The music teacher
leaves his computer open

402
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.918
- during fifth period.
- Mm-hm.

403
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:56.086
I started to ditch Science

404
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.671
so I could go
and practice guitar.

405
00:29:57.755 --> 00:29:59.149
then I'd change it on the computer.

406
00:29:59.173 --> 00:30:00.090
Makes sense.

407
00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.174
There's this girl.

408
00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.385
In jazz band. Piper.

409
00:30:03.469 --> 00:30:05.054
She started to ditch with me.

410
00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:06.137
But then Kevin...

411
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.390
- Who's Kevin?
- My best friend.

412
00:30:08.474 --> 00:30:09.474
Atleast. he was.

413
00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:10.851
What'd Kevin do?

414
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:12.603
Kevin found out
and wanted to ditch too.

415
00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:14.313
But he's not even in jazz band.

416
00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:15.876
He just wanted
to hang out with Piper.

417
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:17.650
I was the one
hanging out with Piper.

418
00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:18.734
So I'm supposed to go in

419
00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.086
and change
his "absent" to "present."

420
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.487
so he can hang out with Piper?

421
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.570
It's bullshit.

422
00:30:22.613 --> 00:30:24.615
So instead.
I gave him three more "absents."

423
00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:26.825
Good. Send a message.

424
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:28.994
He got busted
and told the Vice Principal.

425
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:30.078
Kevin.

426
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:32.665
So I slashed
the tires on his bike.

427
00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:39.105
I know. You're disappointed.

428
00:30:39.129 --> 00:30:40.506
I am disappointed.

429
00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:41.674
Look.

430
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:42.817
if you're gonna hack a mainframe.

431
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:43.926
you do it quietly.

432
00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:45.886
You go in through a back door.
No fingerprints.

433
00:30:45.969 --> 00:30:47.614
But more importantly.
the second this kid. Kevin

434
00:30:47.638 --> 00:30:50.140
knew what you were doing.
you got a loose end.

435
00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:51.642
Never trust anybody.

436
00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:53.352
Anybody.

437
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:55.813
And never let someone
get the upper hand on you.

438
00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:56.897
'Cause they'll use it.

439
00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:01.359
Yeah.

440
00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:11.578
All right.
I got to go practice.

441
00:31:11.662 --> 00:31:13.539
I have
this dumb winter pageant thing

442
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:14.748
tonight for jazz band.

443
00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:16.041
A pageant?

444
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:17.125
Oof.

445
00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:19.878
I know. I said it was dumb.

446
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:22.297
Good luck.

447
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.330
We're gonna talk when I come in.

448
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:27.428
I know.

449
00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.597
I thought labor
wasn't progressing?

450
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:32.141
Yeah. Then it did.

451
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.059
Thanks for picking him up though.

452
00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:35.787
I don't know what's going on
with him these days.

453
00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:36.937
He's acting out.

454
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.314
Yeah. well. you know.
growing up is tough.

455
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.233
Is that why
you're avoiding it?

456
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:43.610
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

457
00:31:43.694 --> 00:31:45.195
Yeah.

458
00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:47.114
He'd really love to see you
more often. Jack.

459
00:31:47.197 --> 00:31:48.197
I just picked him up.

460
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.616
- I know.
- It was really nice.

461
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.344
We had a good talk.
He told me about school.

462
00:31:51.368 --> 00:31:53.304
- I mean. I don't know what...
- He would love that to happen

463
00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:54.496
more often is all I'm saying.

464
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.580
I got to go to work.

465
00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.375
- Okay.
- Yeah.

466
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:00.586
Merry Christmas. Jack.

467
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:03.255
Yeah.

468
00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.549
Merry Christmas. Jack.

469
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:30.943
Hi. Jack.

470
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.759
We know what you did.

471
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:55.385
Huh?

472
00:34:55.802 --> 00:34:57.012
We know what you did.

473
00:35:02.893 --> 00:35:03.894
Okay. Um...

474
00:35:06.063 --> 00:35:08.815
First of all. sorry.

475
00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:12.736
Second.
could you be more specific?

476
00:35:12.819 --> 00:35:13.963
Honestly. you could be talking

477
00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:15.405
about 12 different things
right now.

478
00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:16.907
Who are you working for?

479
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.577
Lady. I don't know
what you're talking about.

480
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:22.371
I work for whoever pays me.

481
00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.456
You have about 40 seconds
to become helpful

482
00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.124
before you have
a terrible accident.

483
00:35:26.208 --> 00:35:28.460
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

484
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.712
Who hired you to find him?

485
00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:32.255
- Find who?
- You know who.

486
00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:34.091
I promise you. I don't.

487
00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:35.258
If I did. I would tell you.

488
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.594
I'm not a scrupulous person.
You can ask anybody.

489
00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:41.848
The Intercontinental Seismic
Surveillance System.

490
00:35:41.932 --> 00:35:42.932
Sound familiar?

491
00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:46.520
Yeah.

492
00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:47.854
I did that.

493
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:48.981
It was a weird job.

494
00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:50.291
Somebody was trying
to find someone

495
00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:53.026
who was running tests on some
weapons systems in the Arctic.

496
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.654
And I... I found the location.

497
00:35:55.737 --> 00:35:56.780
And I walked.

498
00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:58.824
- For who?
- I don't know.

499
00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:00.450
I'm telling you.
all the communication

500
00:36:00.534 --> 00:36:01.994
is encrypted and untraceable.

501
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:03.787
That's how it's supposed to be.

502
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.163
So if someone
like you shows up.

503
00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:06.707
I don't have any answers.

504
00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:09.334
Look. I don't ask questions.

505
00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:11.628
I just find people
that no one else can find.

506
00:36:11.712 --> 00:36:13.130
It's what I do.

507
00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:20.012
You really don't know what you did.

508
00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:21.805
I guess not.

509
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.470
I mean. I can tell you're
very upset about it though.

510
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:31.189
Box him up.

511
00:36:31.857 --> 00:36:33.233
Box me up? Wait. wait.

512
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:34.317
What do you mean... Hey!

513
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.251
Is this really necessary?

514
00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:55.338
Ow.

515
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:08.727
Cool place.

516
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.395
How long you been here?

517
00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:14.149
- "M-O-R-A"?
- MORA.

518
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.651
The Mythological Oversight
and Restoration Authority.

519
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.236
Come again?

520
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.363
We are the multilateral
international organization

521
00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:22.157
responsible for securing
and protecting

522
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.533
the mythological world.

523
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:26.911
Come with me.

524
00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:30.665
Did you say
the "mythological world"?

525
00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:32.292
- Yes.
- Right.

526
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.628
So. uh...

527
00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:38.673
Bigfoot. Loch Ness Monster.

528
00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:39.757
That kind of thing?

529
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.093
That kind of thing.

530
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.260
Okay.

531
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:44.805
So. things that don't actually exist.

532
00:37:44.888 --> 00:37:46.723
you guys
are responsible for 'em.

533
00:37:46.807 --> 00:37:47.974
Got it.

534
00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:51.103
Holy shit!

535
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:07.160
If he knows anything.
he ain't talking.

536
00:38:07.244 --> 00:38:08.578
All right.
Horse back to the pen.

537
00:38:08.662 --> 00:38:09.788
body back to Area 32.

538
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:11.873
And get the pumpkin
back in the cryo-vault. stat.

539
00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:13.458
Yes. Director.

540
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:15.085
What the hell was that?

541
00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:16.294
The Horseman.

542
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:18.421
We're questioning
all the usual suspects.

543
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:22.676
The Headless Horseman?

544
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.847
Hey. What did that taser thing
do to my head?

545
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.765
It's not a taser.
it's an Acquiescer.

546
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:31.143
Just take a deep breath
and have a seat. Jack.

547
00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:52.455
What am I doing here?

548
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:58.044
Last night. at roughly
11:00 p.m.. NPST.

549
00:38:58.712 --> 00:39:02.465
Red One. also known
as Saint Nicholas of Myra.

550
00:39:02.549 --> 00:39:04.885
was abducted
from the North Pole Complex.

551
00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:10.932
The data you retrieved
from the I-triple-S

552
00:39:11.016 --> 00:39:12.559
was used
to pinpoint the location.

553
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.436
which has been secure
and classified

554
00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:16.188
for several hundred years.

555
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:26.198
Use your words.

556
00:39:26.281 --> 00:39:27.532
Are you saying...

557
00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:33.205
Santa Claus has been kidnapped?

558
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:36.291
And you think
I had something to do with it?

559
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.626
Where is he?

560
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:41.421
Is that him?

561
00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:44.090
Jack "The Wolf" O'Malley.

562
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:47.093
meet Callum Drift.
Commander of the E.L.F.

563
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:49.596
"The E.L.F."?

564
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:51.407
Turns out Jack here didn't know
what he was doing.

565
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:53.391
Somebody hired him to find the complex

566
00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:54.559
and. incredibly. he did.

567
00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:56.728
- Who?
- He doesn't know.

568
00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:57.687
I don't know.

569
00:39:57.771 --> 00:39:59.606
- Yes. he does.
- No. he doesn't.

570
00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:01.233
They always know something.

571
00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:04.110
Sometimes you just got
to shake it out of them.

572
00:40:05.654 --> 00:40:08.073
I'm not gonna like you.
I can tell right away.

573
00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:10.200
Out of everyone here.
I like you the least.

574
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:12.702
Garcia.

575
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.625
What the hell?

576
00:40:19.876 --> 00:40:22.087
- Yeah. Chief?
- This guy's not cooperating.

577
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:24.339
Ah. Should we do the thing?

578
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:25.524
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

579
00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:26.776
Cal. let's talk about this for a minute.

580
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.818
There's nothing to talk about.

581
00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.522
You can't trust this guy.
He's on The List.

582
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:30.988
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

583
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:32.198
Look. I'm not on any watchlist.

584
00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:33.723
I know for a fact that...

585
00:40:35.392 --> 00:40:37.102
Wait a minute.

586
00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:38.853
- You don't mean...
- Yes. That list.

587
00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:41.398
You're on it. I checked. NL-four.

588
00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:42.816
Are you telling me this clown

589
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:45.151
is a level-four Naughty Lister?

590
00:40:45.235 --> 00:40:47.696
"A level-four Naughty Lister"?

591
00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:48.839
- Oh. Is that funny to you?
- Hey.

592
00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:49.698
Hey. hey. hey!

593
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:51.616
What are we doing here? Come on.

594
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.910
I know this is killing you.
But you have to trust me.

595
00:40:53.994 --> 00:40:55.912
Dismembering this shitbag
isn't gonna help.

596
00:40:55.996 --> 00:40:58.039
It would feel good. but it won't help.

597
00:40:58.123 --> 00:40:59.249
I'm right here.

598
00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:00.333
Shut up.

599
00:41:02.585 --> 00:41:04.745
- What are you thinkin'?
- We're gonna put him to work.

600
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:05.630
No.

601
00:41:05.714 --> 00:41:07.299
- Absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

602
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:09.301
You said you work for whoever pays you.

603
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.011
Today. that's me.

604
00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:13.030
He's not telling us everything he knows.
Look at him.

605
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:14.323
He is telling us everything he knows.

606
00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:15.700
he just doesn't know who hired him.

607
00:41:15.724 --> 00:41:16.724
Well. I mean.

608
00:41:17.851 --> 00:41:19.894
- how much are we talking here?
- Garcia?

609
00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:21.813
I'm...

610
00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.774
Okay. I don't know who it was.

611
00:41:24.858 --> 00:41:26.985
but I could figure out where they are.

612
00:41:27.068 --> 00:41:28.268
Or where they were last night!

613
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.990
God!

614
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:37.287
Look. it is anonymous.
I don't know who it is.

615
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:41.333
But in my line of work.
I need insurance.

616
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:43.084
You know. in case of billing issues.

617
00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:44.210
So. I Trojan horsed

618
00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:46.296
a digital tracking bug into their VPN.

619
00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:48.190
- Are you saying...
- Yeah. I can track the device.

620
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:49.549
Then I suggest you do it.

621
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:51.360
Can we circle back
on the whole paying me thing?

622
00:41:51.384 --> 00:41:53.303
I know what they paid you.
We'll double it.

623
00:41:54.054 --> 00:41:55.430
- Triple.
- Garcia?

624
00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:57.098
Hey. hey. hey! Come on.

625
00:41:57.182 --> 00:41:59.392
All right. all right. Double's fine.

626
00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:00.476
It's Christmas.

627
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:01.603
Wise choice.

628
00:42:02.228 --> 00:42:03.271
I need my cell phone.

629
00:42:10.487 --> 00:42:11.863
Whoever did this...

630
00:42:13.073 --> 00:42:14.449
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

631
00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:16.576
- I work alone.
- You used to.

632
00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:18.787
No offense.
but I'm not rolling into Aruba

633
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.497
undercover with a giant elf.

634
00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:22.499
It's E-L-F.

635
00:42:22.582 --> 00:42:24.542
- Cal!
- We can't trust this guy.

636
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:26.544
That's why you're holding the leash.

637
00:42:26.628 --> 00:42:27.796
And this...

638
00:42:29.381 --> 00:42:31.800
...is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

639
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:33.593
You're mine until we find him.

640
00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:35.387
I suggest you get going.

641
00:42:38.348 --> 00:42:40.642
Oh! God. claws!

642
00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:07.377
Well. this is unfortunate.

643
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.839
No. This is what needed to be done.

644
00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:13.216
I sincerely doubt that.

645
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:16.302
You know. I know a guy

646
00:43:16.386 --> 00:43:18.805
who's gonna be very upset about this.

647
00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.503
What are you going to do with that?

648
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:30.316
The world is a mess.
Because they fear nothing.

649
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:34.779
I'm going to give them
something to fear.

650
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:39.159
I'm going to do in one night

651
00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:43.163
what you have failed to do
for centuries.

652
00:43:43.997 --> 00:43:45.248
And what is that?

653
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.667
I'm gonna make the world a better place.

654
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:00.763
- What're you doing?
- Borrowing some of your energy.

655
00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:05.768
Now.

656
00:44:07.187 --> 00:44:09.105
go to sleep. Nicholas.

657
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.066
Go to sleep.

658
00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:45.117
We doing some last-minute
Christmas shopping?

659
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:46.142
Gearing up.

660
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:48.311
Grab a car. Something practical.

661
00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:03.117
Here.

662
00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:13.252
Let's go.

663
00:45:25.265 --> 00:45:27.642
Ooh!

664
00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:46.160
What the hell just happened?

665
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:47.744
Toy stores.

666
00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:51.165
Toy stores what?

667
00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:53.167
The supply closets are portal stations

668
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:55.628
for the North Pole
Field Network Transit System.

669
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.471
Car.

670
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.518
I said. "Practical."

671
00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:12.020
Like what. a minivan?

672
00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:13.563
Who wants a practical Hot Wheels?

673
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:15.040
Also. what difference does it make?

674
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:16.064
I gave you a directive.

675
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.443
A directive?

676
00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:22.363
Is that what you think
is going on here?

677
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:24.907
I'm telling you now.
you better listen to me

678
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.701
because things are about to get real.

679
00:46:42.508 --> 00:46:43.988
- How did...
- I adjusted its reality.

680
00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:45.529
- And does that...
- No. it doesn't work

681
00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:46.947
on everything. No. you can't try it.

682
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.848
No. you can't drive.
No more questions.

683
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:51.225
Now. get in.
And be careful with those robots.

684
00:47:10.536 --> 00:47:13.289
So you're. like.
the bodyguard for Santa Claus?

685
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:16.000
I'm the commander of the E.L.F.

686
00:47:16.084 --> 00:47:17.085
What's that stand for?

687
00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:19.337
Enforcement.
Logistics and Fortification.

688
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.130
But as far as you're concerned.

689
00:47:21.214 --> 00:47:23.925
it stands for
Extremely Large and Formidable.

690
00:47:25.802 --> 00:47:27.095
Uh-huh.

691
00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:30.682
And that's all you do all year...

692
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:33.184
just protect Santa?

693
00:47:34.102 --> 00:47:35.186
It's a big job.

694
00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:36.771
Sure. sure.

695
00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:40.733
It's one day though. right?

696
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.695
Like. it's a big job for one day?

697
00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:45.530
We work 364 days a year

698
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:49.117
because on that one day.
we deliver presents

699
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.744
to several billion
individual domiciles

700
00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:53.871
across 37 time zones.

701
00:47:53.955 --> 00:47:56.833
Without ever being detected
by a single human being.

702
00:47:56.916 --> 00:47:58.418
We prep. we rehearse.

703
00:47:58.501 --> 00:48:01.212
every moment. every stop.
down to the last chimney.

704
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:03.548
So. yeah. it's a lot of work.

705
00:48:04.424 --> 00:48:05.842
364 days?

706
00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:06.968
We have Boxing Day off.

707
00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:12.140
Wouldn't it be easier
if you broke it up?

708
00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:13.823
You know. like.
send different teams out.

709
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.727
different places.
just more efficient?

710
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.019
No. it doesn't work like that.

711
00:48:17.103 --> 00:48:18.438
He's got to do it all himself?

712
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:20.898
He doesn't have to. It's his purpose.

713
00:48:20.982 --> 00:48:22.608
He's a singular force in the universe.

714
00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:24.235
Okay. so worst-case scenario.

715
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:25.958
is there someone
that can step in for him?

716
00:48:25.987 --> 00:48:29.073
- Like a Vice Santa...
- Are you listening to me? No.

717
00:48:29.157 --> 00:48:30.867
No one can do what he does.

718
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.703
He knows when you're sleeping.
he knows when you're awake.

719
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:35.997
And he knows that
about every single person

720
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.290
on this planet.

721
00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:39.000
He has a list the size of Rhode Island.

722
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.877
and he checks it twice.

723
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.688
If you were to try to read
that list just once.

724
00:48:42.712 --> 00:48:43.792
it would take you a decade.

725
00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:45.173
But he does it twice.

726
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:47.550
And the reason why
he's able to do any of it

727
00:48:47.633 --> 00:48:50.887
is because he is Santa Claus.

728
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.472
The one and only.

729
00:48:52.555 --> 00:48:55.349
And no one else
can execute his mission.

730
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:59.395
- Which is?
- To spread cheer. asshole.

731
00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:02.106
Good feeling.

732
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:06.360
Ready for a test.

733
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:08.446
Bring me the weapon.

734
00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:02.875
Duplication complete.

735
00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:03.960
Good.

736
00:50:04.877 --> 00:50:07.171
Now. let's see if it works.

737
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.423
Who do you have in mind. Mom?

738
00:50:09.966 --> 00:50:11.968
We'll start with
the first name on The List.

739
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.907
All right. now we're talking.

740
00:50:37.702 --> 00:50:40.371
Well. it was nice to meet you. Cal.

741
00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:41.664
Good luck with everything.

742
00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:42.957
Thank you so much.

743
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.667
I'm just gonna live here now.

744
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.669
- Gonna marry her.
- Why don't you focus?

745
00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:48.129
We got to find your guy.

746
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:51.340
Not a lot of fun. are you. Cal?

747
00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:54.594
Oh. I'm fun.

748
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:56.492
As a matter of fact. I won the prize

749
00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:59.515
for Most Fun Gift-Wrapper
for 183 years in a row.

750
00:51:02.143 --> 00:51:03.227
Well. I take it back.

751
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.650
Want me to show you
how to do this?

752
00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:11.402
I would suggest
you give it a shot.

753
00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:13.237
I see the worst in everyone. Cal.

754
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:15.197
It's my gift.

755
00:51:15.865 --> 00:51:17.158
And it's the key to my work.

756
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:19.577
I can see a person's worst qualities

757
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.579
just by looking at 'em.

758
00:51:21.662 --> 00:51:24.624
See. look at this guy.
He's married. but not to her.

759
00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:25.833
That's why he has a tan line

760
00:51:25.917 --> 00:51:27.418
where his wedding ring should be.

761
00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:29.670
This guy's about to screw over that guy.

762
00:51:30.838 --> 00:51:32.190
That's why he's laughing too loud.

763
00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:34.592
And this guy.

764
00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:36.218
now he's interesting.

765
00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:37.595
"Why." you ask?

766
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:39.597
- I didn't ask.
- Well. I'll tell ya.

767
00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:41.264
Shoes.

768
00:51:41.891 --> 00:51:42.767
Look around.

769
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.644
Anyone else at the beach wearing shoes

770
00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:46.020
besides you. me. and him?

771
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:48.147
We're all working something.

772
00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:56.822
Ah.

773
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:59.533
He's a Karmanian Death Merc.

774
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:02.161
So is that guy and that guy.

775
00:52:02.244 --> 00:52:04.288
You can tell by the tattoos
on their hands.

776
00:52:04.372 --> 00:52:05.414
This is all fascinating.

777
00:52:05.498 --> 00:52:07.578
How about we find the guy
we're actually looking for?

778
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.227
That's the guy we're looking for.

779
00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:10.252
Absolutely fulfilled.

780
00:52:11.587 --> 00:52:13.506
The Karmanians
are his security detail.

781
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:15.341
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

782
00:52:15.758 --> 00:52:17.551
We'll have a few drinks.
paint some nails.

783
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:18.820
we'll see where the afternoon takes us.

784
00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:20.012
Hey. wait. Whoa. whoa. whoa.

785
00:52:20.096 --> 00:52:21.856
- What are you doing?
- Going to talk to him.

786
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.642
No. no. we got to go in sideways here.

787
00:52:24.725 --> 00:52:26.605
Remember when I said
they're called Death Mercs?

788
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:28.311
We'll be fine.

789
00:52:38.197 --> 00:52:39.198
Keep walking.

790
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:40.655
I need to talk to him now.

791
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.660
Keep walking.

792
00:52:42.743 --> 00:52:44.245
I'm gonna count to five.

793
00:52:45.913 --> 00:52:47.873
- Then what?
- Then. you're gonna get hurt.

794
00:52:47.957 --> 00:52:49.000
Oh.

795
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.715
Listen. dickhead. It's Christmas.

796
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:57.216
So in the Yuletide spirit.

797
00:52:57.299 --> 00:52:58.551
I'm gonna say it one more time.

798
00:53:22.658 --> 00:53:25.161
That was so disturbing.

799
00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:27.663
What's this?

800
00:53:27.747 --> 00:53:29.248
What the hell. Ted?

801
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:30.708
Just give me a minute. sweetheart.

802
00:53:30.791 --> 00:53:34.170
I got to talk to these
absolute morons for a second.

803
00:53:34.253 --> 00:53:36.005
And then. we'll go get some boba.

804
00:53:36.088 --> 00:53:37.381
Okay.

805
00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:38.883
Where is he?

806
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:40.468
- Who?
- You know who.

807
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:41.611
You really want to do this?

808
00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:44.513
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

809
00:53:44.597 --> 00:53:46.140
And while I'm enjoying this visit

810
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:49.435
from the Magic Mike
Christmas Brigade.

811
00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:51.729
I got a couple ladies
waiting on boba teas. yeah?

812
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:52.813
Okay. big boy. come on.

813
00:53:52.897 --> 00:53:54.082
Okay. Hey. hey. wait. wait. wait.

814
00:53:54.106 --> 00:53:55.816
Before you implode this man's skull

815
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.777
across this heavenly beach.

816
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.070
can I have a crack at it?

817
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:00.279
Look. I'm telling you.

818
00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:02.198
for your own health and well-being.

819
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:04.617
I suggest you leave right now.

820
00:54:05.493 --> 00:54:06.827
You don't know who I know.

821
00:54:07.495 --> 00:54:09.413
All right. Well. you know what I know?

822
00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:11.457
I know you bought
some information yesterday.

823
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.820
and you paid quite a bit for it.

824
00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:16.045
Coordinates. The Arctic.

825
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.174
I know this
'cause I'm the one who sold it to you.

826
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:22.968
You...

827
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:26.971
You're the Wolf?

828
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:28.933
No.

829
00:54:29.475 --> 00:54:30.475
You should not be here.

830
00:54:30.518 --> 00:54:32.853
Do you know
what you've done by coming here?

831
00:54:32.937 --> 00:54:35.689
My client is not to be messed with.

832
00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:36.853
Who's the client? New York?

833
00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:38.567
Much worse.

834
00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:40.069
She'll kill us.

835
00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:41.654
- She'll kill us all.
- Who is it?

836
00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:44.490
I can't say her name.

837
00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:46.450
She will hear.

838
00:54:51.413 --> 00:54:52.493
Write her name in the sand.

839
00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:03.342
- Gryla?
- Oh. no.

840
00:55:03.425 --> 00:55:04.677
- You idiot!
- Gryla?

841
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.845
No!

842
00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:08.097
<i>Gryla?</i>

843
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:26.949
No.

844
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:33.622
Cal. Cal!

845
00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.641
Callum Drift.

846
00:55:52.725 --> 00:55:57.730
Storied Warrior of the North Pole.

847
00:56:00.191 --> 00:56:02.943
Gryla. the Christmas Witch.

848
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:05.863
It has been many years.

849
00:56:05.946 --> 00:56:07.156
Not enough.

850
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.366
Where is he?

851
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:10.826
He's right here.

852
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.078
Fast asleep.

853
00:56:15.456 --> 00:56:16.665
Signal from Commander Drift.

854
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.211
<i>Gryla. where are you?</i>

855
00:56:20.294 --> 00:56:22.129
The Witch.

856
00:56:22.213 --> 00:56:25.507
I need him back. Unharmed. Immediately.

857
00:56:25.591 --> 00:56:28.469
It is not to be. warrior.

858
00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:29.929
I need M-WAT teams in motion

859
00:56:30.012 --> 00:56:31.722
to every one of her ancestral haunts.

860
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:32.805
Yes. Director.

861
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.391
What is it you want?

862
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:39.230
The same thing I have always wanted
for hundreds of years.

863
00:56:39.313 --> 00:56:42.107
To make them behave.

864
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:44.276
The time has come.

865
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.237
To punish the naughty.

866
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:49.198
All of them.

867
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:52.034
Everyone who is on The List.

868
00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:56.038
Everyone who has ever been
on The List.

869
00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:59.333
From killers to jaywalkers.

870
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:02.461
Anyone who's ever lied or littered.

871
00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:05.756
Anyone who's ever been rude or late.

872
00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:09.176
You're talking about almost everyone.

873
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.804
Everyone I see fit.

874
00:57:11.887 --> 00:57:14.682
Tomorrow they will all be punished.

875
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:19.812
And he is going to help.

876
00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:21.897
You know he doesn't punish people.

877
00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:24.942
Step away. warrior.

878
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:26.527
Let him go. Witch.

879
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.903
I've warned you.

880
00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:30.364
And I've warned you.

881
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.449
You can't see it yet.

882
00:57:32.533 --> 00:57:36.203
but when you wake up
this Christmas morning.

883
00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:40.416
the world will be much. much...

884
00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:42.584
Nicer.

885
00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:49.925
What in the actual fu...

886
00:57:51.593 --> 00:57:53.178
Get those teams moving now!

887
00:57:54.847 --> 00:57:55.848
What the hell was that?

888
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:57.683
What was that?

889
00:57:57.766 --> 00:57:59.018
What the hell was that?

890
00:57:59.101 --> 00:58:00.745
- Where is she?
- We got to get outta here.

891
00:58:00.769 --> 00:58:01.830
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

892
00:58:01.854 --> 00:58:03.605
I'm just a middleman.
I brokered the deal.

893
00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:04.732
I'm telling you...

894
00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:06.817
- she does not mess around.
- Cal? Cal.

895
00:59:00.204 --> 00:59:01.330
Snowmen.

896
00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:16.178
No.

897
00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:17.655
Get him outta here. he's our only lead.

898
00:59:17.679 --> 00:59:19.515
- Don't let him get iced!
- All right!

899
00:59:23.394 --> 00:59:24.561
Come on.

900
00:59:29.233 --> 00:59:30.234
Go. go.

901
01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:13.855
Just got to rip off their carrots.

902
01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.317
I'll remember that
next time it comes up.

903
01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:20.862
Want to give me a hand here?

904
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.322
You'll figure it out.

905
01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.533
Uh...

906
01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:32.892
I'm sorry.
I think you're confusing me

907
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.585
with someone who cares.

908
01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.878
Tell Grandma I don't have time
to pick up her meds.

909
01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:39.548
She can take the bus. Goodbye.

910
01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:41.717
Asshole!

911
01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:43.885
Get a life.

912
01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.234
Whoa!

913
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.529
What the...

914
01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:18.629
It's still here.

915
01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.173
What do you mean it's still there?

916
01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.592
It's supposed to come back to me.

917
01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.844
The machine isn't working.

918
01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.388
Fix it. Now!

919
01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.515
Or else the next test
will be on one of you.

920
01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.560
Yes. Mom.

921
01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:37.773
Careful.

922
01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.026
That's it.

923
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.238
She iced the broker.

924
01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.407
She really wanted to shut him up.

925
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.660
By the time he thaws out.
he'll be useless to us.

926
01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:51.620
Hey. wait. wait. wait.

927
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:52.847
My guy scanned
all the surveillance footage

928
01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.456
from the Pole last night.

929
01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.540
Look at this.

930
01:03:58.835 --> 01:03:59.711
Is that her?

931
01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:02.673
Sort of.
She's a shapeshifter.

932
01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.108
She's actually a 900-year-old ogre

933
01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.093
with 13 sons who kill on command.

934
01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:07.719
Oh.

935
01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:10.222
Tracking shapeshifters
is a nightmare.

936
01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.391
She said that she was gonna
punish them all.

937
01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:13.767
Every level.

938
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.811
I'd be more worried
about what she didn't say.

939
01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:17.813
She wasn't negotiating.

940
01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.481
It's a kidnapping with no demands.

941
01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:20.732
Doesn't usually end well.

942
01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:23.777
Unfortunately.
our only lead is now an ice cube.

943
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.029
Not pointing any fingers.

944
01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.782
- Cal. Not helpful.
- Yeah. Cal.

945
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:30.242
Not helpful.

946
01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:33.984
So. what would you normally do?

947
01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:38.291
I mean. normally.
I'd be running credit cards.

948
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.835
Checking pings off cellphone towers.

949
01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.038
trying to build a footprint.

950
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.504
Her. her associates.

951
01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:44.089
Never tracked a witch before.

952
01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.425
Dated a few.

953
01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:47.509
Right. Cal?

954
01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:49.845
I've dated several witches.
What's your point?

955
01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:52.657
Would you have any footprint
that I wouldn't know about.

956
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:55.559
because I'm. like.
a regular human being?

957
01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.811
Have you run a check on recent UDMs?

958
01:04:58.895 --> 01:04:59.895
What's that?

959
01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:02.190
Unauthorized Deployments of Magic.

960
01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:06.403
Lot of hits.
Pretty typical stuff.

961
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.406
Couple of abjurations in Nairobi.

962
01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.908
Handful of divinations
in Santiago and New Orleans.

963
01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:13.285
No. she's a Conjurer.

964
01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:16.288
Got a pair of
conjurations eight days ago.

965
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.748
few hours apart.

966
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.041
Picked up the echo
off the resonator in Germany.

967
01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:21.835
The Brother.

968
01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:24.671
- Whose brother?
- Nick's.

969
01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:26.923
- Santa's got a brother?
- Adopted. yes.

970
01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:29.134
She's working with The Brother.

971
01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.469
- We don't know that.
- No.

972
01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:32.321
but can you think of
a better place to hold Nick?

973
01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:34.347
Think about it.
It's under a concealment dome.

974
01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.516
and MORA has no jurisdiction
because of the treaty.

975
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.977
He doesn't leave. and we don't visit.
That's the deal.

976
01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.062
We bust in and Nick's not there...

977
01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.346
MORA's not going. we're going.

978
01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:43.750
And he's never gonna know we're there.

979
01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:45.984
- Cal.
- T-minus 17 hours. Director.

980
01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.492
Keep me in the loop every step.

981
01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:54.826
In two hours.

982
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:56.304
I brief the presidents
and prime ministers.

983
01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:57.913
and kings and queens of everywhere.

984
01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:58.997
So they can prepare.

985
01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:00.791
Prepare for what?

986
01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.752
For the possibility of no Christmas.

987
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:13.970
Hey. You don't have
a Wonder Woman action figure. do you?

988
01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.847
It's not how it works. Come on!

989
01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:17.057
Ah. damn it.

990
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.812
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

991
01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:40.872
I can't believe
they're out of essential oils!

992
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:48.504
Hey.

993
01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:50.340
Dylan asked you
to go to his concert tonight.

994
01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:51.299
and you said no?

995
01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:53.718
What? No. that's not what happened.

996
01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:55.112
He actually said I shouldn't go.

997
01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.346
He said it was gonna be lame.

998
01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.098
If he didn't want you to go.

999
01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.683
<i>he wouldn't have brought it up.</i>

1000
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.185
An actual parent
doesn't need an invitation.

1001
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:04.604
They just go.
whether the kid likes it or not.

1002
01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.106
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

1003
01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:09.317
Well. we both know
that's not my strong suit. Olivia.

1004
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.903
Look. if he wanted me to go.
he should've just asked me.

1005
01:07:11.987 --> 01:07:13.405
He's vulnerable. Jack.

1006
01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:16.241
He's a kid.
and he knows you never show up.

1007
01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:17.826
Olivia. I'm in...

1008
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:18.909
I'm at work.

1009
01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:20.412
What am I supposed to do?

1010
01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.306
I don't want to have to tell you
what to do. Jack.

1011
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.724
I want you to figure it out on your own.

1012
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:24.875
Because it's pretty easy.

1013
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.418
The concert starts at seven.

1014
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.687
Well. I'm not gonna to be home
by seven.

1015
01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.605
- Just tell Dylan that I...
<i>- I'm not telling him anything.</i>

1016
01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.798
If you want to tell him
something. do it yourself.

1017
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:36.970
What?

1018
01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:38.972
I didn't say anything.

1019
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.076
Dylan. right?

1020
01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.289
Yeah.

1021
01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.251
He's a good kid.

1022
01:08:08.335 --> 01:08:09.794
Yeah. I know he's a good kid.

1023
01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:20.680
It's not what you think.

1024
01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:23.016
His mother and I were never together.

1025
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.310
I mean. I'm his father.
but I've never been his dad.

1026
01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:28.605
She's a doctor now.

1027
01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.208
And she's married
to a really good guy.

1028
01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.566
and he is a good dad.

1029
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:33.610
So. the last thing
the kid needs is like.

1030
01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:37.197
you know. some "spare dad"
who's a degenerate gambler.

1031
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.716
hanging out with the scum of the earth

1032
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.220
whose got nothing to offer him. so...

1033
01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.387
Honestly. the best thing
I can do for the kid

1034
01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.412
is keep some distance.

1035
01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:45.580
so I don't get in the way

1036
01:08:45.664 --> 01:08:47.916
and he's not disappointed all the time.

1037
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.501
Uh-huh.

1038
01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.087
"Uh-huh" what?

1039
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:55.090
I'm just saying. if you're trying
not to disappoint him...

1040
01:08:57.342 --> 01:08:59.302
doesn't sound like it's working.

1041
01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:28.665
Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this...

1042
01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.210
but what's the deal
with Santa and his brother?

1043
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.175
They used to work together.

1044
01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:41.720
Back in the beginning.

1045
01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.764
Red gave gifts to well behaved children.

1046
01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:46.848
and The Brother helped
keep track of who they were.

1047
01:09:47.976 --> 01:09:49.769
Then The Brother started making lists.

1048
01:09:51.146 --> 01:09:53.148
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1049
01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:54.691
He didn't like the idea

1050
01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.776
of a running list
of misbehaved children.

1051
01:09:58.069 --> 01:09:59.863
But The Brother became obsessed.

1052
01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:02.991
So you're saying.

1053
01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:05.577
Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1054
01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.162
Yes.

1055
01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:10.249
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1056
01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.834
Red was furious.

1057
01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:14.961
So he took The List away.

1058
01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:17.630
Then The Brother never forgave him.

1059
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:19.883
He went out on his own.

1060
01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.113
Eventually hooking up with The Witch.

1061
01:10:22.177 --> 01:10:24.554
who was also in the punishment game.

1062
01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.432
Working Iceland
and several other Nordic territories.

1063
01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:32.187
They were together for years.
but it ended badly.

1064
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.066
Santa's brother have a name

1065
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.859
or is it just "Santa's Brother"?

1066
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.696
His name is Krampus.

1067
01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:48.929
All right. listen to me. I don't know

1068
01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.056
what's waiting for us in here.

1069
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.540
but The Brother and The Witch.
they're extremely dangerous.

1070
01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.209
And not in the ways
that you're used to.

1071
01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.960
If you see them. do not engage.

1072
01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:57.837
So don't pick a fight with The Witch.

1073
01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:58.797
Got it.

1074
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.048
If Nick is here.

1075
01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.400
he's probably being held
in the dungeon.

1076
01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.152
There's a door around back
that the guards use.

1077
01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:05.112
We're gonna have to quietly
sneak through the courtyard.

1078
01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.936
past the guillotines.
break in. and head down.

1079
01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:07.972
Wait. guillotines?

1080
01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:10.975
Also. do not touch anything.
Under any circumstances.

1081
01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:13.853
There is much in here
that is not of the natural world.

1082
01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.647
You're human. therefore weak.

1083
01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.483
So. if you need to touch anything.
get me to do it.

1084
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.444
Wait a minute.

1085
01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:22.946
Are you not human?

1086
01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.405
Do I look human?

1087
01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:09.576
Hey. so listen. man.

1088
01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.244
I think if you don't need me here.

1089
01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.079
I might just go back to the car.

1090
01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:20.879
Hellhounds.

1091
01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:22.630
Hellhounds?

1092
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680
Stand back.

1093
01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.856
Ellen. distract them.

1094
01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:27.320
What'd you do?

1095
01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.589
What do you mean. "what did I do?"

1096
01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:29.656
I didn't do anything!

1097
01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:34.953
Thieves!

1098
01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.081
Holy shit!

1099
01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.125
Whoa! Whoa!

1100
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:42.293
Cal! Cal!

1101
01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.379
My name is Callum Drift.
Commander of the E.L.F.

1102
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.065
- We are not thieves.
- Yeah. we're not thieves!

1103
01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.131
We're not thieves!

1104
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.176
Ooh!

1105
01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.263
This was in his pocket.

1106
01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:54.597
All right. I can explain that.

1107
01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:55.765
I can explain that.

1108
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:05.024
I told you not to touch anything.

1109
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:06.442
It was an innocent mistake.

1110
01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.254
You tried to steal
a priceless piece of gold

1111
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:10.238
from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1112
01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.824
Not "innocent." and not a "mistake."

1113
01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.547
Well. who leaves their gold
just lying out

1114
01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:15.785
in an open treasure chest?

1115
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.662
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1116
01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.455
Guests come. they leave him gifts.

1117
01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:20.915
You stole from it.

1118
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.918
I shouldn't be surprised.

1119
01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.213
Is that 'cause
I happen to be on "The List"?

1120
01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.882
You disappointed in me too. Cal?

1121
01:14:30.425 --> 01:14:32.302
I have no expectations of you. Jack.

1122
01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.012
so I can't be disappointed.

1123
01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:42.979
You know.
I got problems of my own.

1124
01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:45.773
I owe somebody a lot of money
that I don't have.

1125
01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:48.151
I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

1126
01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:50.462
If you look at it a certain way.

1127
01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.612
what choice did I even have?

1128
01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:52.739
You have every choice.

1129
01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:54.741
It's all choices.

1130
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.909
You don't just "happen to be"
on The List. Jack.

1131
01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.703
you put yourself there.

1132
01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.539
You decide to steal gold.

1133
01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:03.916
You decide
to only look out for yourself.

1134
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.710
over everyone else on this Earth.

1135
01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.796
Every one of those kids
who are counting on us.

1136
01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:13.593
Counting on me. to do my job.

1137
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.892
Nick always says.

1138
01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:23.311
that every decision.

1139
01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:25.938
big or small. is an opportunity.

1140
01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:28.691
To be "nice"?

1141
01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:29.817
To be good.

1142
01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.320
Or not.

1143
01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:38.284
I was one day away from retirement.

1144
01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.078
And this happens.

1145
01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:43.706
After 542 years.

1146
01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:47.919
I resigned yesterday.

1147
01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.045
You did?

1148
01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.216
Why?

1149
01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:56.719
I couldn't see it anymore.

1150
01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.055
Couldn't see what?

1151
01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:04.560
It doesn't matter.

1152
01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.368
The First Touch!

1153
01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:27.417
Is that him?

1154
01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:38.344
What are they doing?

1155
01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:45.184
They're playing Krampusschlap.

1156
01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:47.979
"Krampusschlap"?

1157
01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:51.190
It's the official game of <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1158
01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:05.872
Ever undefeated!

1159
01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:09.542
It's Lord Krampus!

1160
01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:20.136
Callum Drift.

1161
01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.305
Lord Krampus.

1162
01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:26.392
The festivities were just beginning.

1163
01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:28.728
But I don't remember inviting you.

1164
01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:37.487
You shouldn't be here.

1165
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:39.989
You know you shouldn't be here.

1166
01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.700
And yet here you are.

1167
01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.494
And with a mortal.

1168
01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:47.538
Uh. I'm Jack O'Malley.

1169
01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:48.998
I didn't... I'm not...

1170
01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.833
We didn't even...
I mean. obviously we...

1171
01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.336
I just met him today.

1172
01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:55.505
The big one was armed with this.

1173
01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.466
A Northern Vambrace.

1174
01:17:58.549 --> 01:17:59.926
Thank you.

1175
01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.471
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

1176
01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:07.099
- Krampus. I can explain...
- You're trying to find him.

1177
01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.436
And you thought he would be here.

1178
01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:13.940
Well. guess what. Northerner?

1179
01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.070
He's not here.

1180
01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.366
Last night he was taken
from The Compound.

1181
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:24.825
by The Witch.

1182
01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:27.578
And I know that she was here
not long ago.

1183
01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:32.041
Are you accusing me of something. Drift?

1184
01:18:33.084 --> 01:18:35.127
You and she were partners once.

1185
01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.421
Roaming the countryside. the villages.

1186
01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:39.549
Punishing people.

1187
01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.133
Yes.

1188
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:44.303
But back then she was glorious.

1189
01:18:45.263 --> 01:18:47.557
An Ogre 18 feet high.

1190
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.725
the skin of an elephant.

1191
01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:53.020
giant pair of tails.

1192
01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:58.734
And. yes. punishing
as the cruelest winter.

1193
01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:02.363
We had some wonderful times together.

1194
01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:06.117
But I gave up that work. remember?

1195
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.247
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty.

1196
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:14.458
trying to scare them into decency.

1197
01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:15.793
I did my part!

1198
01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:19.630
The only punishing I do now...

1199
01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:23.050
is for fun.

1200
01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.678
Like my good friend over here.

1201
01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:30.850
Enjoying his headache on <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1202
01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:32.685
But today is not <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1203
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.062
In this house. Northerner.

1204
01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:39.233
it is always <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1205
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:53.623
Krampus!

1206
01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:56.959
Why was she here?

1207
01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:02.506
Many years ago. she gave me a gift.

1208
01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.635
She came because she wanted it back.

1209
01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:06.636
A gift?

1210
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:07.928
What gift?

1211
01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:10.222
The <i>Glaskäfig.</i>

1212
01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:13.976
On its face.
a simple glass snow globe.

1213
01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.146
But its true purpose is nefarious.

1214
01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.482
tremendously punishing.

1215
01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.526
She wants to punish them all.

1216
01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:26.322
The <i>Glaskäfig</i> is solitude.

1217
01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:28.574
A prison for but one.

1218
01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.285
Krampus. I need to find him.

1219
01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.250
Let me go.

1220
01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.629
And why...

1221
01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:44.006
would I do that?

1222
01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:48.886
Because we need him.

1223
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.723
Now more than ever. we need him.

1224
01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.559
And you know that.

1225
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:59.438
Let me go.

1226
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.491
Northerner...

1227
01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:14.036
you are not going anywhere.

1228
01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:18.082
You. Get out.

1229
01:21:18.165 --> 01:21:20.751
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1230
01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.004
There is a price for this intrusion.

1231
01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:27.341
Now and forever.

1232
01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.760
Drift belongs to me.

1233
01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.599
So I can...

1234
01:21:35.683 --> 01:21:37.059
just walk out of here?

1235
01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.395
I suggest you run.

1236
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:45.526
You'll learn to love it here.

1237
01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.279
Take him away.

1238
01:21:51.449 --> 01:21:53.075
Wait! Uh... Wait. wait. wait!

1239
01:21:53.159 --> 01:21:53.993
Sorry. wait. Um...

1240
01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.619
Lord...

1241
01:21:55.703 --> 01:21:56.787
Mister-Lord Krampus...

1242
01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.124
you and I aren't so different.

1243
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.380
We're pretty different. but I think

1244
01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:07.649
we have some things in common.

1245
01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:10.009
Ah. Do you now?

1246
01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.343
Yeah.

1247
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:12.571
I mean. you strike me as a guy

1248
01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.263
that likes to have a good time.

1249
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:15.473
Bit of a gambler.

1250
01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.974
Well. so am I.

1251
01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:19.393
Now. when we came in here.
my man told me

1252
01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:22.646
that he thought he could
beat you at your game

1253
01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:25.316
- Krampalslop.
- What?

1254
01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:29.528
Now. initially I said "no way."

1255
01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:31.253
But the more I see him getting riled up.

1256
01:22:31.322 --> 01:22:32.482
I'm starting to like my odds.

1257
01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.408
So. just hear me out.

1258
01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:38.245
If you win.
we go to your dungeon forever.

1259
01:22:38.329 --> 01:22:41.332
If he wins. we walk.

1260
01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.543
Unless you don't want to.
for some reason.

1261
01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:46.212
I mean. I get that. he's a big guy.

1262
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:49.673
There's no shame.
Lot of people watching.

1263
01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:56.096
Imbeciles!

1264
01:22:57.264 --> 01:22:58.432
I love it!

1265
01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:15.366
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1266
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:26.877
The rules are as follows.

1267
01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:30.381
The contestants will
exchange blows. in turn.

1268
01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:34.009
The first to be knocked out
or die. loses.

1269
01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.225
First Touch.

1270
01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:42.935
That's you.

1271
01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:56.156
You know. I really wish

1272
01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.259
there was another way
that we could do this.

1273
01:23:57.283 --> 01:23:59.243
Come on.

1274
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.120
I'm sure you do.

1275
01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.581
He's still your brother.

1276
01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:06.333
And he never gave up on you.

1277
01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.752
What would you know about it?

1278
01:24:08.836 --> 01:24:10.087
I know him.

1279
01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:16.343
Take your best <i>'schlap.</i>

1280
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:33.736
Interesting.

1281
01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:37.573
My turn.

1282
01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:45.331
I could be merciful.

1283
01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:48.042
and kill him on the First Touch.

1284
01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:51.253
But what fun would that be?

1285
01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:04.016
Oh. my God.

1286
01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:20.532
Hey. buddy. you okay?

1287
01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:22.534
He just slapped the shit out of me.

1288
01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:23.911
Yeah. that was so embarrassing.

1289
01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.413
I love this game!

1290
01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:29.124
I can't beat him.
He's a Winter Demigod.

1291
01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:30.668
Just get up. Trust me.

1292
01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:31.751
I can't.

1293
01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:40.678
Second Touch.

1294
01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:44.264
Oh. Sorry.

1295
01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.313
Let me make it easier for you.

1296
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.193
Come on.

1297
01:25:59.947 --> 01:26:01.115
Come on.

1298
01:26:06.245 --> 01:26:07.496
Come on.

1299
01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:28.474
Cover us.

1300
01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:13.812
Ellen. come on!

1301
01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:35.209
I thought I had some shady friends.

1302
01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:39.379
I can't believe that worked.

1303
01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.757
Yeah. sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

1304
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.342
No. it was great.

1305
01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.468
Well.

1306
01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:47.763
I misjudged you.

1307
01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:48.847
Ha!

1308
01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:50.849
Not what you'd expect

1309
01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:52.684
from a "Class Four
Naughty Lister." right?

1310
01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:53.977
Well. it's Level Four.

1311
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.687
But that's what I'm saying.

1312
01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.940
you could've left. But you didn't.

1313
01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.110
Thank you.

1314
01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:04.988
All right.

1315
01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:06.615
Should we go find your guy?

1316
01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.326
Let's save Christmas.

1317
01:28:11.537 --> 01:28:12.538
Right.

1318
01:28:13.247 --> 01:28:14.247
Say it.

1319
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:15.582
- I can't.
- Yes. you can.

1320
01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:16.917
- Say it.
- I don't want to.

1321
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.920
- Let's save Christmas.
- I'm not gonna say that.

1322
01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:22.673
I'm gonna need you to say.
"Let's save Christmas."

1323
01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:24.758
All right. God! Okay.

1324
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.468
Let's save Christmas.

1325
01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:28.846
That was terrible.

1326
01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:31.306
Okay. All right. all right.

1327
01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:36.061
Let's save Christmas.

1328
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.855
There it is.

1329
01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.314
All right.

1330
01:28:39.398 --> 01:28:40.816
All right. so the snow globe.

1331
01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.335
What's the deal with that?
The glossy pig?

1332
01:28:42.359 --> 01:28:44.945
<i>Glaskäfig.</i> It's German for "Glass Cage."

1333
01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:47.468
Well. what do you think Gryla's
trying to do? Is there only...

1334
01:28:48.282 --> 01:28:49.908
<i>Gryla's trying to do?</i>

1335
01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:53.996
We gotta go. Come on.

1336
01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:56.957
Mom.

1337
01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.042
Ready for another test.

1338
01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.004
Good.

1339
01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:03.338
The next name on The List?

1340
01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:05.632
No.

1341
01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.427
I have a better idea.

1342
01:29:11.555 --> 01:29:13.557
She said
she wanted to punish them all.

1343
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.660
It seems like the <i>Glaskäfig</i>
was just for one person.

1344
01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.769
Is it possible she could make
more of 'em with like.

1345
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.063
"witch magic" or...

1346
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:21.982
She would need billions of them.

1347
01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:23.066
She's immensely powerful.

1348
01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:24.630
but that's a big lift for a Conjurer.

1349
01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:26.653
Okay.

1350
01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:28.256
I mean. honestly.
the only place that has

1351
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.591
that kind of manufacturing capacity...

1352
01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:30.615
Look out!

1353
01:29:55.933 --> 01:29:57.809
This something
that happens to you a lot?

1354
01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.062
Unexplained player piano

1355
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.605
in the middle of a German highway?

1356
01:30:02.481 --> 01:30:03.815
No.

1357
01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:04.900
This is rare.

1358
01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:13.074
It's for you.

1359
01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:15.494
Well.
I'm not touching that thing.

1360
01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:16.741
Just get back in the truck.

1361
01:30:16.787 --> 01:30:18.139
we'll drive right around
the haunted piano.

1362
01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.164
We have to open it.

1363
01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:23.460
This... This is how it starts.

1364
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:25.504
You're doing it though.

1365
01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.016
Oh. see?

1366
01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:44.272
Dylan.

1367
01:30:44.523 --> 01:30:46.233
<i>Did you send me
this stupid present</i>

1368
01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:47.596
<i>instead of coming to this thing?</i>

1369
01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:49.069
Wait. what?

1370
01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.113
Because if you don't want to come.
I don't care.

1371
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.508
I wanted to be there.
I really did. then something...

1372
01:30:53.532 --> 01:30:55.325
<i>Just stop. okay?</i>

1373
01:30:55.409 --> 01:30:56.994
<i>You don't have to pretend</i>

1374
01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:58.578
<i>because my mom
is guilt-tripping you.</i>

1375
01:30:58.662 --> 01:30:59.997
I'm not pretending.

1376
01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.182
<i>I really want to find a way to...</i>

1377
01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:02.291
You never come to anything.

1378
01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:03.625
Yeah. I...

1379
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:05.419
- I know. I know.
<i>- Whatever.</i>

1380
01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:06.503
<i>I got to go.</i>

1381
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.797
<i>Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts. okay?</i>

1382
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.520
Wait. wait. Dylan.
what'd you mean by that?

1383
01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:12.843
<i>This thing.</i>

1384
01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:15.321
- Dylan. don't touch that!
- No!

1385
01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:16.430
- Don't!
- Wait!

1386
01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.366
Do you seriously think
that there's any kid on Earth.

1387
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:19.575
<i>- who really wishes...</i>
- Dylan. listen to me!

1388
01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:20.475
- Put that down!
<i>- ...he had a snow globe?</i>

1389
01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:21.959
<i>Because I'm here
to tell you that...</i>

1390
01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:25.272
What is this? What's going on?

1391
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:30.801
- What's happening?
- Put that down.

1392
01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:35.741
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

1393
01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.034
I don't know!

1394
01:31:41.455 --> 01:31:42.497
Jack!

1395
01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:46.918
It's my kid.

1396
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920
Find me.

1397
01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:05.145
Dad? Dad!

1398
01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:06.308
- Dylan!
- What's going on?

1399
01:32:06.355 --> 01:32:07.564
Where are we?

1400
01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:11.818
Oh. my God.

1401
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.529
Oh. my God.

1402
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.242
It worked.

1403
01:32:24.623 --> 01:32:26.166
Jack O'Malley.

1404
01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.502
Level four.

1405
01:32:28.585 --> 01:32:31.797
What a perfect way
to start my collection.

1406
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:34.633
Bring production online!

1407
01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:55.069
Tonight.

1408
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:56.905
I will deliver one of these

1409
01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:59.658
to every single deviant on The List.

1410
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.744
And when they wake up
and open their gift.

1411
01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:04.788
they'll join my collection.

1412
01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:08.250
And the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

1413
01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:10.167
Finally.

1414
01:33:10.877 --> 01:33:12.087
Tonight.

1415
01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:14.339
I make The Ride.

1416
01:33:17.551 --> 01:33:18.718
Director. we have Drift.

1417
01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:20.094
What happened?

1418
01:33:20.137 --> 01:33:21.680
What do you know about the <i>Glaskäfig?</i>

1419
01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.141
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison The Naughty.

1420
01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:25.559
Krampus has it. Why?

1421
01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:27.561
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

1422
01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:29.330
<i>And I think she's trying
to punish everyone on The List.</i>

1423
01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:30.230
Wait. slow down.

1424
01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:31.648
O'Malley just got globed.

1425
01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:32.816
<i>and disappeared.</i>

1426
01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:34.734
- What?
- His kid too.

1427
01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:36.528
Oh. dear Lord.

1428
01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:38.697
- Run O'Malley's tag.
- Yes. Director.

1429
01:33:41.283 --> 01:33:43.493
Zoe. I think she's trying
to mass produce the <i>Glaskäfig.</i>

1430
01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:45.287
<i>How could she possibly do that?</i>

1431
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.431
<i>Think about it.
What's the one place</i>

1432
01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:47.998
<i>that's capable of something like that?</i>

1433
01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:50.208
The North Pole.
But Nick's not there.

1434
01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:52.919
The complex runs on his power.
That can't be it.

1435
01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:55.881
- Unless...
<i>- Unless he never left.</i>

1436
01:33:56.548 --> 01:33:58.216
But the snowcat. the jet...

1437
01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.926
<i>Drones. Diversions.</i>

1438
01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:03.180
Nick is still there.

1439
01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:05.307
Director.
I am not picking up a signal

1440
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.433
for O'Malley's tracker.

1441
01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:10.937
Because he's under the dome.

1442
01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:13.323
<i>But I've been talking
to your team all night.</i>

1443
01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:14.816
You have?

1444
01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:20.238
Try Partridge.

1445
01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:21.490
Connect to Partridge.

1446
01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:22.866
Yes. Director.

1447
01:34:24.618 --> 01:34:26.036
<i>- Hi. Cal.
- Hey.</i>

1448
01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:27.329
<i>How you holding up. MC?</i>

1449
01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:28.830
I can't sleep.

1450
01:34:28.914 --> 01:34:31.500
I'm just keeping myself busy
baking cookies for him.

1451
01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:33.793
For when he comes home.

1452
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:36.630
Well. he's gonna love that.
What do you got baking?

1453
01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:40.634
Just pulled out
a fresh batch of macaroons.

1454
01:34:43.595 --> 01:34:44.679
He'll love that.

1455
01:34:45.931 --> 01:34:47.933
Hang in. And I'll keep you posted.

1456
01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.227
<i>Thanks.</i>

1457
01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:52.729
That's not her.

1458
01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:54.022
What do you mean?

1459
01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:55.357
<i>Nick hates macaroons.</i>

1460
01:34:57.484 --> 01:34:58.818
They're shapeshifters.

1461
01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.655
The Witch. the Lads.
They're all shapeshifters.

1462
01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:04.991
The North Pole has been taken.

1463
01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:14.459
They're onto us.

1464
01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:16.086
Where are we?

1465
01:35:16.169 --> 01:35:17.230
- What's happening?
- Okay. okay. okay.

1466
01:35:17.254 --> 01:35:18.255
Now. listen.

1467
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:21.883
Now. I know
what this is going to sound like.

1468
01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.469
Basically...

1469
01:35:27.514 --> 01:35:29.349
Santa is missing.

1470
01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:32.852
and that giant lady is a witch.

1471
01:35:32.936 --> 01:35:34.312
And she got the snow globes

1472
01:35:34.396 --> 01:35:37.315
from a giant demonic Christmas

1473
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:39.150
goat-man.

1474
01:35:39.818 --> 01:35:41.570
And now. they're gonna make
millions of 'em.

1475
01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:44.573
with that magical photocopier thing.

1476
01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:46.801
Look. I don't have
all the technical details.

1477
01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:49.452
but basically these globes
are meant to imprison

1478
01:35:49.536 --> 01:35:51.663
the naughty people forever.

1479
01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:53.790
Forever?

1480
01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:57.377
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1481
01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:05.844
Remember. we can't trust anyone.

1482
01:36:08.555 --> 01:36:09.555
I've got a signal.

1483
01:36:10.432 --> 01:36:11.512
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1484
01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:16.187
We're close.

1485
01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:17.314
Hey. Chief.

1486
01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:19.899
Fred.

1487
01:36:21.526 --> 01:36:23.445
I'll let the team know that you're back.

1488
01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:24.613
How about you don't.

1489
01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:31.161
Shapeshifters.

1490
01:36:31.911 --> 01:36:33.121
Good tidings.

1491
01:36:39.044 --> 01:36:41.087
It says he should be right here.

1492
01:36:45.717 --> 01:36:46.885
The old tunnel system.

1493
01:36:48.053 --> 01:36:49.653
Runs right beneath
the Original Workshop.

1494
01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:51.598
Let's go.

1495
01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.119
Is this happening
because I was ditching?

1496
01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:56.311
- What?
- Is it because

1497
01:36:56.394 --> 01:36:57.520
I slashed Kevin's tires?

1498
01:36:57.604 --> 01:36:59.689
No. no. no. no. no. no. Dylan.

1499
01:36:59.773 --> 01:37:01.542
You said it was for
naughty people. didn't you?

1500
01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:02.627
Well. she said that. but...

1501
01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:04.277
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1502
01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:05.819
Look at me.

1503
01:37:07.072 --> 01:37:09.407
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1504
01:37:10.283 --> 01:37:11.409
Everybody does.

1505
01:37:11.493 --> 01:37:13.203
Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1506
01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:15.664
You're only in here...

1507
01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:18.667
because of me.

1508
01:37:21.211 --> 01:37:22.212
What did you do?

1509
01:37:23.046 --> 01:37:24.798
Mmm. A lot of stuff.

1510
01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.633
It's a long list.

1511
01:37:28.802 --> 01:37:31.054
But bigger than any of that.
it's what I didn't do.

1512
01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.390
What are you talking about?

1513
01:37:40.105 --> 01:37:41.731
I've been a terrible father.

1514
01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:44.484
It's not true.

1515
01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:46.403
Yes. it is. It is.

1516
01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:47.862
I haven't been around.

1517
01:37:47.946 --> 01:37:51.157
I told myself I was doing you a favor.
which is bullshit.

1518
01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:52.826
It was bad for you.

1519
01:37:52.909 --> 01:37:54.285
And it was terrible for me.

1520
01:37:55.995 --> 01:37:58.164
I've made some mistakes. pal.
I know that.

1521
01:37:59.124 --> 01:38:01.292
But I also know
that I can do better.

1522
01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:04.504
And I know that's easier said than done.

1523
01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:07.841
I know it's a lot of work
and I hope it's not too late.

1524
01:38:11.344 --> 01:38:13.012
Every day.

1525
01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:14.597
every decision.

1526
01:38:14.681 --> 01:38:16.057
is an opportunity.

1527
01:38:19.728 --> 01:38:21.328
And I want to start
taking some of those.

1528
01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:24.524
So. I'm not asking you
to believe me.

1529
01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:27.777
I'm just asking for you
to give me a chance.

1530
01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:30.989
I know I may never be

1531
01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:32.907
the greatest father in the world.

1532
01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:34.868
but I know I can do better.

1533
01:38:34.951 --> 01:38:37.620
And I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1534
01:38:38.705 --> 01:38:40.081
I will never stop trying.

1535
01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:08.276
What just happened?

1536
01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:14.616
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1537
01:39:15.992 --> 01:39:17.160
Can we get out of here?

1538
01:39:17.243 --> 01:39:18.243
Yeah.

1539
01:39:18.787 --> 01:39:20.955
First. we gotta find somebody.
Come on.

1540
01:39:30.423 --> 01:39:31.591
Ow.

1541
01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:33.091
Cal!

1542
01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:35.654
If you could make any toy in the world

1543
01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:36.958
real right now.
what would it be?

1544
01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:40.432
Wonder Woman.

1545
01:39:40.809 --> 01:39:42.894
It's him. You all right?

1546
01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:44.604
Yeah. yeah.

1547
01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:46.564
It's good to see you.

1548
01:39:47.315 --> 01:39:48.315
Dad?

1549
01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:52.445
Buddy. come here.
I want you to meet some friends.

1550
01:39:52.529 --> 01:39:54.656
Cal. Zoe. this is my son Dylan.

1551
01:39:55.782 --> 01:39:57.116
The one and only Dylan.

1552
01:39:57.575 --> 01:39:59.015
Your dad's told me
so much about you.

1553
01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:02.580
Welcome to the North Pole.

1554
01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:04.499
Huh?

1555
01:40:04.582 --> 01:40:05.583
I can't believe she got

1556
01:40:05.667 --> 01:40:07.252
the old Quatuplicator
back online again.

1557
01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:08.521
This thing has been
out of commission

1558
01:40:08.545 --> 01:40:09.712
since the late 1800s.

1559
01:40:09.796 --> 01:40:11.923
This thing was cranking out
snow globes like rat turds

1560
01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:14.008
and it just stopped.
like somebody pulled the plug.

1561
01:40:14.092 --> 01:40:14.926
Cal. we saw her.

1562
01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:17.178
She said she was
gonna do The Ride herself.

1563
01:40:17.262 --> 01:40:18.304
What?

1564
01:40:18.388 --> 01:40:20.282
Deliver one of these snow globes
to everybody on The List.

1565
01:40:20.306 --> 01:40:22.892
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1566
01:40:22.976 --> 01:40:24.227
Without him.

1567
01:40:24.727 --> 01:40:26.087
We can't let that sleigh take off!

1568
01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:30.024
There's a subterranean
access point in the hanger.

1569
01:40:31.234 --> 01:40:32.234
Wait.

1570
01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:41.202
Chief!

1571
01:40:41.286 --> 01:40:42.745
Garcia.

1572
01:40:42.829 --> 01:40:43.830
Cal.

1573
01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:48.459
Ma'am.

1574
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:50.753
Where is he?

1575
01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:21.075
Gryla! Stop!

1576
01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:33.713
I was just leaving.

1577
01:41:35.798 --> 01:41:36.674
Go. Take him.

1578
01:41:36.758 --> 01:41:38.092
Come with me. Dylan.
I got him.

1579
01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:55.485
Come on!

1580
01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.403
Go!

1581
01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:18.299
Ha!

1582
01:44:27.678 --> 01:44:30.640
Nick! Come on. buddy. I got you.

1583
01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:42.485
Red!

1584
01:44:42.568 --> 01:44:45.154
Come back to me.
Come back to me. boss.

1585
01:44:45.238 --> 01:44:46.656
Wake up.

1586
01:44:49.742 --> 01:44:52.662
Nick! Nick! It's Cal.

1587
01:45:06.509 --> 01:45:07.510
Cal!

1588
01:45:19.397 --> 01:45:20.481
Holy shit!

1589
01:45:22.608 --> 01:45:23.609
Jack.

1590
01:45:27.864 --> 01:45:29.157
Run.

1591
01:45:29.866 --> 01:45:31.242
No way. man.

1592
01:45:32.034 --> 01:45:34.203
For a guy like me.
there're worse ways to go out

1593
01:45:34.287 --> 01:45:35.997
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

1594
01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:40.459
Gryla!

1595
01:45:41.586 --> 01:45:42.753
It's time for you to go!

1596
01:45:44.463 --> 01:45:49.594
Oh. I'll go.
But I'm taking him with me.

1597
01:45:50.553 --> 01:45:52.513
You're not taking him anywhere.

1598
01:45:53.055 --> 01:45:56.642
His power has been wasted
for far too long.

1599
01:45:56.726 --> 01:45:59.854
The punishing begins tonight.

1600
01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:03.524
You're gonna have to
go through me first.

1601
01:46:03.608 --> 01:46:04.901
With pleasure.

1602
01:46:26.005 --> 01:46:28.090
You imbeciles have no idea

1603
01:46:28.174 --> 01:46:30.301
how to talk to a woman like this.

1604
01:46:31.302 --> 01:46:33.095
A real woman.

1605
01:46:34.972 --> 01:46:36.807
She's my ex.

1606
01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:39.894
Hello.

1607
01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:42.063
my love.

1608
01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:43.731
Get out of here. Krampus!

1609
01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:46.192
I can't do that.

1610
01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:51.739
And lovely as it is
to see your miserable face.

1611
01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:55.618
my brother has somewhere to be.

1612
01:47:05.711 --> 01:47:07.505
Just like old times.

1613
01:47:39.287 --> 01:47:41.247
Haven't you had enough?

1614
01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:44.625
If you wanna take him...

1615
01:47:46.294 --> 01:47:47.712
you're gonna have to kill me.

1616
01:47:49.547 --> 01:47:51.549
Gladly.

1617
01:47:51.632 --> 01:47:53.676
Your sacrifice will mean nothing.

1618
01:47:54.969 --> 01:47:55.970
Gryla!

1619
01:47:58.597 --> 01:47:59.598
Enough!

1620
01:48:01.142 --> 01:48:05.187
Any last words
for your most faithful warrior?

1621
01:48:06.022 --> 01:48:07.023
Only one.

1622
01:48:08.858 --> 01:48:11.277
Kavalame!

1623
01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:19.493
Merry Christmas. Witch.

1624
01:48:33.924 --> 01:48:34.925
No!

1625
01:48:36.927 --> 01:48:39.513
No! No!

1626
01:48:43.893 --> 01:48:46.145
No!

1627
01:48:49.899 --> 01:48:51.567
- No!
- Well. look at you!

1628
01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:53.152
Oh. shut up!

1629
01:48:56.989 --> 01:48:58.115
Nick.

1630
01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:00.950
You okay?

1631
01:49:02.787 --> 01:49:03.788
Yeah.

1632
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.460
What took you so long?

1633
01:49:27.937 --> 01:49:31.023
Well. look what the cat dragged in.

1634
01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:34.193
Let's not get mushy.

1635
01:49:35.277 --> 01:49:36.529
Thank you. brother.

1636
01:49:39.573 --> 01:49:41.242
Merry Christmas.

1637
01:49:42.785 --> 01:49:44.078
Brother.

1638
01:49:46.288 --> 01:49:47.957
You wanna maybe
stick around a while?

1639
01:49:51.961 --> 01:49:52.962
Don't push it.

1640
01:49:55.464 --> 01:49:56.757
Get to work.

1641
01:49:58.592 --> 01:49:59.593
And you.

1642
01:50:00.845 --> 01:50:02.221
I want a rematch.

1643
01:50:08.978 --> 01:50:11.272
Happy <i>Krampusnacht!</i>

1644
01:50:17.945 --> 01:50:20.990
Oh. my God!
Honey. where are you?

1645
01:50:21.073 --> 01:50:23.117
<i>Mom.
you're not gonna believe this.</i>

1646
01:50:25.202 --> 01:50:26.829
<i>T-plus six minutes.</i>

1647
01:50:26.912 --> 01:50:28.247
Sky Train. this is Partridge.

1648
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:30.249
Back in the chair
and back on track.

1649
01:50:30.332 --> 01:50:31.584
<i>Good to have you back. ma'am.</i>

1650
01:50:38.174 --> 01:50:40.050
We are currently
six minutes behind schedule.

1651
01:50:40.134 --> 01:50:42.595
So we're gonna run the preflight
like our hair's on fire.

1652
01:50:58.944 --> 01:51:00.112
Dylan.

1653
01:51:00.279 --> 01:51:01.322
Jack.

1654
01:51:01.864 --> 01:51:03.073
- Hi.
- Hi.

1655
01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:04.366
Thanks for your help today.

1656
01:51:05.451 --> 01:51:06.660
He helped too.

1657
01:51:08.162 --> 01:51:09.163
I know.

1658
01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:14.502
<i>All systems are go.</i>

1659
01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.545
<i>30 seconds to launch.</i>

1660
01:51:18.964 --> 01:51:20.090
Hey. Drift.

1661
01:51:22.009 --> 01:51:23.093
Have a great ride.

1662
01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:26.138
Merry Christmas. Director.

1663
01:51:29.183 --> 01:51:30.226
Dylan. Jack.

1664
01:51:32.228 --> 01:51:33.229
You guys coming?

1665
01:51:35.397 --> 01:51:36.524
- What?
- Really?

1666
01:51:36.607 --> 01:51:38.442
Come on. let's go. We gotta roll.

1667
01:51:40.319 --> 01:51:43.239
Red One.
you are cleared for take-off.

1668
01:53:11.869 --> 01:53:13.162
Copy that.

1669
01:53:13.245 --> 01:53:14.580
We're coming at you.

1670
01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:54.953
Yes! Yes!

1671
01:54:05.881 --> 01:54:07.508
He really does it. doesn't he?

1672
01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:10.260
Goes everywhere in the entire
world in one night.

1673
01:54:10.344 --> 01:54:12.763
He's a lot cooler
than I thought he was.

1674
01:54:13.764 --> 01:54:15.557
And a lot more athletic.

1675
01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:16.975
Yeah. the guy's a beast.

1676
01:54:17.059 --> 01:54:18.143
The guy is a beast.

1677
01:54:47.423 --> 01:54:49.091
You're seeing it. aren't you?

1678
01:54:50.259 --> 01:54:52.052
Yeah. I knew you'd get it back.

1679
01:54:53.554 --> 01:54:55.264
I lost it there for a while. Nick.

1680
01:54:55.347 --> 01:54:57.099
It's easy to lose it. Cal.

1681
01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.561
The important thing is to keep trying.

1682
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:07.443
Nick.

1683
01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:09.737
I'd like to stay on.

1684
01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:12.364
If you'll have me.

1685
01:55:16.493 --> 01:55:17.661
You got it. Commander.

1686
01:55:24.752 --> 01:55:26.253
Did we just save Christmas?

1687
01:55:28.005 --> 01:55:30.174
I think we just saved Christmas.

1688
01:55:45.898 --> 01:55:47.983
Kavalame!
