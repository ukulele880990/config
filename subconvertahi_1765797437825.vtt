<i>Beloved countrymen.</i>

3
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.996
the New Liberalism party
is the only force in Colombia

4
00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.531
that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

5
00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:35.032
"There are
three ways the narcotraffickers...

6
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:39.229
- try to weaken extradition."
- try to weaken extradition.

7
00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.783
- "Bribery..."
- Bribery...

8
00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.647
"intimidation through violence..."

9
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.678
intimidation through violence...

10
00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.023
- "...and extortion."
- and extortion!

11
00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:52.176
- "A dark and terrible scourge."
- A dark and terrible scourge.

12
00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.397
What are you doing?

13
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.686
Just making sure he gets it right.

14
00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.595
You wrote it. you should know.

15
00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.430
- Mm.
- Look. I brought you this.

16
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.934
What's this?

17
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.734
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

18
00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.239
How's Galán doing?

19
00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.708
All right.

20
00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:24.273
I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

21
00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:27.149
There are other things to mention.

22
00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:29.915
Galán's got some balls.

23
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:34.584
Brave men have a way of dying quickly.

24
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:40.564
Well. then. you don't have to worry...
do you?

25
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:44.936
Aah...

26
00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.135
Pass me the socks.

27
00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.698
First thing
is that we get you out of Bogotá.

28
00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:25.204
- OK.
- There's an orphanage in Cumaral.

29
00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.366
It's out of the guerrilla zone
and away from the narcos.

30
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:29.773
And then what?

31
00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.275
We get you a passport.

32
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.116
From another country. we can depose you
about Escobar and the siege.

33
00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.913
You may have run away from your country.
but I'm not running away from mine.

34
00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.194
This is about keeping you alive.

35
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.013
Do you sleep with all your informants?

36
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.910
I'm not your responsibility.

37
00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:15.455
If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll kill you in a heartbeat.

38
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:20.454
Not if I kill him first.

39
00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:26.476
Yeah. she's a live hand grenade.

40
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.493
She's the only witness we got that
can tie Escobar to the palace massacre.

41
00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.115
Hard to bring her in when
she gets turned over to the Colombians

42
00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.506
and she gets disappeared.
Are you ready for that?

43
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:35.802
No.

44
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.672
So what's our options.
since we have none?

45
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.756
Well. we keep her in hiding
until things cool down.

46
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.758
and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

47
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.013
Are you gonna get us immunity?

48
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.631
We are going to jail
if we get caught with this woman.

49
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.600
Well. the next time your wife decides
to bring home a human hand grenade.

50
00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.420
how about she hands it to you?

51
00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.929
Are you fucking her?

52
00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:58.756
Sleep with a communist?

53
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.792
That would be downright un-American.

54
00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:08.369
Any intel to support the DEA theory

55
00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.501
that Escobar is behind
the Palace of Justice siege?

56
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.045
No. ma'am.

57
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.116
Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect.

58
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.944
but he hasn't brought him forward.

59
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:20.332
In my book.
there's only two of them that know that.

60
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.787
And one of them is Elisa Alvaro.
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.

61
00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:28.018
The other one is Ernesto Sobrino.

62
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:33.327
a radical priest who gave shelter
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos <i>comuna.</i>

63
00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.661
Is one of these people your informant?

64
00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:39.965
Ambassador. this is...
unofficial wiretap information.

65
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.340
We. uh. intercepted
a discussion between narcos.

66
00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.012
What? Which narcos?

67
00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.673
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- We're almost certain.

68
00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:52.148
It was. uh...
It was hard to tell.

69
00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:54.585
The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

70
00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:56.518
- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

71
00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:58.558
and they know
that he'll support extradition.

72
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.491
and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

73
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.029
Ambassador. word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos.

74
00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.828
and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

75
00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.134
They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

76
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.695
That's horseshit. Peña.
Excuse me. Ambassador.

77
00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:16.607
On one hand. you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

78
00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.905
Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

79
00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.509
You can't have it both ways. son.

80
00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:26.212
Ambassador. Manuel Noriega has helped us
fight communism all over Latin America

81
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.446
for the last two decades.

82
00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.887
I take great offense at any attempt
by the DEA to smear his good name.

83
00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.257
<i>I couldn't help but laugh.</i>

84
00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.363
<i>Right wing. left wing...</i>

85
00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:40.901
<i>For Manuel Noriega.
it was all about the money.</i>

86
00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:45.533
<i>When Bush was head of the CIA.
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater</i>

87
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.543
<i>so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.</i>

88
00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:54.376
<i>When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs</i>

89
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.915
<i>by siding with communists.
he switched teams.</i>

90
00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:02.080
<i>So. we invaded Panama.
and arrested "Old Pineapple Face."</i>

91
00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:04.751
<i>But. that was later.</i>

92
00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:08.920
<i>For now. the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset</i>

93
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:12.329
<i>who was taking money from Bush...
and right from the narcos.</i>

94
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:22.075
<i>Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian
Supreme Court to fight extradition.</i>

95
00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.974
<i>And now. he was offering
to pay off Colombia's national debt</i>

96
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.272
<i>in exchange for a truce.</i>

97
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.240
<i>Guess he missed home.</i>

98
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.762
Look at this
shit. We are spending millions of dollars.

99
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:54.136
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

100
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.770
Listen. the problem isn't the food.
the problem is Noriega.

101
00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:03.315
First chance he gets.
he'll sell us to the Americans.

102
00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.714
You guys stay calm.

103
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.931
Once we reach an agreement with the
government. we'll be back in our homeland.

104
00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:12.651
Pay the Colombian
national debt for amnesty?

105
00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:15.692
I'd rather go live in Spain.

106
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:20.233
I say we go back and fight.

107
00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:23.496
No. sir. none of that.
War is bad for business.

108
00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.868
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

109
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:34.637
Look. Gustavo.
none of this would've happened

110
00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.788
if he hadn't started
killing politicians and judges.

111
00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.182
Tell me what we are supposed to do. then.

112
00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:42.413
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

113
00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:44.216
You know something. Pablo?

114
00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.555
Sometimes. I think you kill these men
because they won't let you in their club.

115
00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:53.494
You better watch your mouth. asshole.

116
00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.884
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

117
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.219
Get used to the food. gentlemen.

118
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.193
It's not safe to go back home.

119
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.223
They've rejected our amnesty deal.

120
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.425
We may have to stay.

121
00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.627
I hate this place.

122
00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:06.932
We can go someplace else.

123
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.442
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

124
00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.842
In Switzerland.
we are nobody. Pablo.

125
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.348
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

126
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:29.424
If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

127
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.130
Do whatever is necessary.
my love.

128
00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.953
<i>So. there it was.</i>

129
00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.323
<i>The decision that would
change Colombia forever.</i>

130
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.657
You're way ahead in the polls.

131
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.825
In my opinion.
the outcome is decided.

132
00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:12.167
My question is... why do you
keep getting involved with the narcos?

133
00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.305
I want a country at peace.

134
00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.072
And if I don't do it. who will?

135
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.571
You're backing them into a corner.

136
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.881
I'm wearing a vest.

137
00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.012
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

138
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.522
isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

139
00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:36.229
Don't worry. my friend.
There will be a future.

140
00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:53.174
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th.</i>

141
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:57.011
<i>against the advice
of his campaign manager. César Gaviria.</i>

142
00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:08.956
<i>The bullets entered just below
his vest and he was dead within minutes.</i>

143
00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:12.065
<i>For a brief shining moment.
there was hope...</i>

144
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.626
<i>extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.</i>

145
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:23.109
<i>To mourn Galán's death. every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...</i>

146
00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:28.239
<i>and in the cities. thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent.</i>

147
00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:31.816
<i>a mute protest
against the violence of the narcos.</i>

148
00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:37.957
<i>With Galán's murder... came the end
of hope for a peaceful future.</i>

149
00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.675
Let's speak clearly. brother.

150
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:49.562
Galán's dead.

151
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.268
You had him killed. didn't you?

152
00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.751
You didn't tell us shit.
and you killed him. you son of a bitch.

153
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.438
- I want to go home. Fabio.
- Home?

154
00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:01.080
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

155
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:07.319
All this shit you talk about partnership.
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

156
00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:16.124
Galán was the only threat.

157
00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:19.923
There is no one left to challenge us.

158
00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.467
And you know why. Fabio.

159
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.461
Because no one
has the balls that we have.

160
00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:30.370
Going home.

161
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.144
<i>Pablo was right.</i>

162
00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.878
<i>Who would have the balls
to fill Galán's shoes?</i>

163
00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:44.380
That unique honesty.

164
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.559
As the people now rise
and call for justice.

165
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.662
I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

166
00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:57.628
as motivation for society
to react and bond...

167
00:13:57.737 --> 00:14:03.040
to support the government...
and institutions...

168
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:07.807
while also demanding
a more effective leadership.

169
00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:11.874
one undeterred by the hitmen.
the hijackings.

170
00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.511
or any other manifestations of violence.

171
00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:18.682
My father. Luis Carlos Galán.

172
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.022
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

173
00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:24.222
to the danger of the narcos.

174
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:30.432
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

175
00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:35.533
As he fell.
another rises in his place.

176
00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:39.507
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

177
00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:43.582
in the name of the people of Colombia.
and my family...

178
00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:49.284
that we entrust my father's ideals to him.
and that he can count on our support...

179
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.549
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

180
00:14:56.562 --> 00:15:00.055
Dr. César Gaviria. save Colombia!

181
00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:05.468
Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!

182
00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:16.716
<i>Dr. César Gaviria...
the new hope of Colombia.</i>

183
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:20.784
<i>If he took Galán's position on
extradition. the narcos would declare war.</i>

184
00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:24.651
<i>If he didn't.
the country would become a narco state.</i>

185
00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.065
Phone!

186
00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:39.336
Let it go to the answering machine.

187
00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:47.446
The machine's full.

188
00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:49.675
I wish it would stop ringing.

189
00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:53.253
It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

190
00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:58.321
Or opinions about what I should do.

191
00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.760
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

192
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.861
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

193
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:13.639
but do you even believe in them?

194
00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.209
I don't know what I believe.

195
00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:23.644
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

196
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:28.853
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

197
00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.652
So say nothing.

198
00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:35.791
That's the best way to stay alive.

199
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:53.304
Gentlemen.

200
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.708
Fernando. cheer up. Have a drink.

201
00:16:57.917 --> 00:16:59.681
We're going home!

202
00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:07.026
- How are you? Hm?
- Fine. my love.

203
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.520
What about you?

204
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.654
Give me one.

205
00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:15.162
Margarita. right?

206
00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:17.195
Let's see.

207
00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.374
- Son of a bitch. that's good.
- Right?

208
00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:25.241
Thank you.
Listen. I've got a question for you.

209
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.540
Why are we going back?

210
00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:30.916
We're walking into a world of shit.

211
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.111
Relax. brother.

212
00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:38.714
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

213
00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:42.283
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

214
00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:47.696
We need to be close by.
Relax.

215
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.894
Don't you get it?

216
00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:55.139
He's only comfortable at war.

217
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.639
He's taking us to the slaughter.

218
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.338
How's business?

219
00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:32.969
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune.
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

220
00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:37.341
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

221
00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:41.979
But do you know what matters most
for our business. Pablo?

222
00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:46.921
That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

223
00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:48.255
Sure.

224
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:05.805
You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

225
00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:10.016
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

226
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.481
Yes.

227
00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:15.151
I would have tried.

228
00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:20.852
The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

229
00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:25.861
Are you listening?

230
00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:29.125
Look at those peaks. Gustavo.

231
00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:39.067
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

232
00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.246
What's happening. Carrillo?

233
00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:49.674
Thank you for coming.

234
00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:51.433
I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

235
00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:53.335
So you practice your English with me?

236
00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.904
Because these men
aren't cleared. and if we speak Spanish.

237
00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.328
it could get back to Pablo.

238
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:02.100
So I started this to monitor
Pablo's <i>sicarios'</i> communications.

239
00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.760
SAT phones. landlines. you name it.

240
00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:06.202
I've got dozens of wiretaps.

241
00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:09.241
but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

242
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:12.436
Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

243
00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.098
So I've had to start surveilling them.

244
00:20:14.914 --> 00:20:17.509
I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

245
00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:20.176
cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets shot down.

246
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.581
But every once in a while...
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

247
00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.951
Do your bosses know you're doing this?

248
00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.262
I trust them even less.

249
00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.893
Most of my men are from here.

250
00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:36.264
where they can get to your mother.
your aunt. your cousin.

251
00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:41.734
How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

252
00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.277
Well. do they have to be from Medellín?

253
00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:54.651
Yes.

254
00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:56.813
I definitely like the red one best.

255
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.091
- Really?
- Mm.

256
00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:01.592
I prefer the gray.

257
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.326
Red is the color of the party.

258
00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:09.231
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

259
00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:12.396
- That's important.
- Mm.

260
00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.741
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

261
00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:21.641
You know. we should
also hire an image consultant.

262
00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:28.452
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth. give you a more modern look.

263
00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:30.520
Now you are going to give me image advice?

264
00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.454
I'm just thinking about the polls.

265
00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:35.456
Anyway...

266
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:42.299
Galán had professionals at his side.
but which could he trust?

267
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.165
Hm?

268
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:47.637
And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me. right?

269
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.174
Mm-hm.

270
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.977
Well. what are you going to choose.
red or gray?

271
00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:05.520
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

272
00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:08.894
"There will be a future."

273
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.627
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

274
00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:23.299
We worked together in the ministry.

275
00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:25.808
The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

276
00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:28.176
shows you our sad state of affairs.

277
00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:31.743
I need to know which side he is on.

278
00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.886
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

279
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.922
They'll certainly ask his position.

280
00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:40.720
Don't worry. Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

281
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.226
- No. I disagree.
- Why?

282
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:46.091
I did an interview with him once.
when he was an economic advisor.

283
00:22:46.232 --> 00:22:49.691
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault.

284
00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:55.241
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

285
00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:58.103
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

286
00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:01.544
He's a bookworm. not a leader.

287
00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:03.912
- No... No...
- No. no. no. you're missing my point.

288
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.950
- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

289
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.051
He's from modest circumstances.

290
00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:11.055
Like you.
he's worked for everything he has.

291
00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:14.523
You have to be careful
with people like that.

292
00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.930
I want you to deliver a message.

293
00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.399
We've made a lot of money.

294
00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:34.947
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

295
00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:40.248
We should talk to our friends down south.

296
00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:44.913
No. no. It's not time. No. Mm?

297
00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:47.786
Whatever you say.

298
00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.452
Have you seen Marina?

299
00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:51.239
She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

300
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.960
You know your sister.

301
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:58.332
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

302
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.188
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

303
00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:08.510
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

304
00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:12.015
I could tell that you really wanted to.

305
00:24:12.151 --> 00:24:14.620
- Come here. baby.
- You are very patient.

306
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.983
Yes. of course.

307
00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:19.959
All your people were there.
your brothers...

308
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.164
My brothers are driving me crazy.

309
00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:35.266
- You know what?
- What?

310
00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:37.809
They can go fuck themselves.

311
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.208
If they want to.
they can go live in Spain...

312
00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:43.145
but you're staying here with me.

313
00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:52.351
Let's not hide anymore.

314
00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:55.392
Not anymore.

315
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:57.690
All right.

316
00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:02.224
What do we do about my wife?

317
00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.468
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

318
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:12.141
Just like he took care of Galán.
he can take care of your wife.

319
00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:21.886
You...

320
00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:25.486
are very evil for such a young girl.

321
00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:32.854
You've moved up. Fernando.

322
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:39.904
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

323
00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:44.042
I guess the pay is much better.

324
00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:46.709
I'm not doing this for the money.

325
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:52.344
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

326
00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:54.913
I understand your dilemma.

327
00:25:55.054 --> 00:26:00.891
Speak out in favor. you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

328
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.397
Speak out against.
you anger the US...

329
00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:09.435
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

330
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:13.027
César. I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

331
00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:16.936
It would be an honor for me.
and would benefit us both.

332
00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:20.411
What a great idea.

333
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.909
You guys are really shameless.
aren't you?

334
00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:28.884
- How do you sleep at night?
- César. it doesn't have to be this way.

335
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:32.786
If Luis had been as smart as you.

336
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:34.985
perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

337
00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:38.927
We could have had peace.

338
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:40.326
Easy.

339
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.497
Get out.

340
00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.570
Read Pablo's letter.

341
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.769
Maybe you will have a future.

342
00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:08.458
They just picked up
that commie priest. Father Sobrino.

343
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.429
He's gonna talk. And when he does.
I hope you DEA boys understand

344
00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:14.159
what's important in this hemisphere.

345
00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:17.660
Well. how about you. uh...
clue us in?

346
00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:21.262
Drug dealers. I mean. bad as they are.
they want your money.

347
00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:23.372
Communists want everything.

348
00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:28.878
I don't know about you. Peña. but I...
I like to own shit.

349
00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:30.343
Right.

350
00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:33.012
Good talk. Lou.

351
00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:36.122
- Very. uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

352
00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:38.281
Oh...

353
00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:43.293
This... priest?

354
00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:47.622
If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

355
00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:50.527
I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

356
00:27:56.775 --> 00:28:00.075
<i>Peña had to figure out
how to get fake papers for Elisa.</i>

357
00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:02.980
<i>So he did what he does best.</i>

358
00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:06.151
Let me guess: it's a very
sad and complicated situation

359
00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.742
involving you and a beautiful local.

360
00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:11.584
You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color. Colleen.

361
00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.502
- What do you want. Javier?
- It's simple.

362
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.927
I just need your signature...
right there.

363
00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:20.425
You want me to create an embassy ID?

364
00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:22.330
- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

365
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.368
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

366
00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:29.670
You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

367
00:28:29.775 --> 00:28:31.437
She's my informant.

368
00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:34.055
And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel.

369
00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:36.173
so come on. Colleen.
whose side are you on?

370
00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.462
Cousin. what happened?

371
00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:56.864
Where were you?

372
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.629
- In the office.
- In the office?

373
00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:00.864
Yes.

374
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.470
Is that where you were?

375
00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.246
That's weird...

376
00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:12.548
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

377
00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:16.482
I don't know which office you called.
but I was there.

378
00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:19.091
They're seizing everything. Pablo.
All the accounts...

379
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:21.717
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán. right?

380
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.792
Yeah.

381
00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.761
Relax. Gustavo.

382
00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:29.997
Relax. because everything
will calm down later.

383
00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:42.811
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us both?

384
00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:46.009
- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

385
00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:56.794
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

386
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:58.691
Put it out. Pablo.

387
00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:01.664
Put it out. Pablo!

388
00:30:10.676 --> 00:30:11.939
Are you with me or what?

389
00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:16.612
And when have I not been with you?

390
00:30:20.686 --> 00:30:23.622
From the beginning.
it has been you and me.

391
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.017
I cannot do this without you.

392
00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:35.833
Are you doubting my loyalty. Pablo?

393
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.036
No.

394
00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:46.739
But I'm having serious doubts
about the Ochoas.

395
00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:12.904
<i>Gaviria read Pablo's letter.</i>

396
00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.901
<i>The terms were simple.</i>

397
00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:21.875
<i>He promised peace
if the narcos were left alone...</i>

398
00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:25.915
<i>and if not...
he promised all-out war.</i>

399
00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:36.388
<i>Carrillo with his wiretaps
knew a storm was on the horizon.</i>

400
00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:40.390
<i>Pablo became his duty
and his obsession.</i>

401
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:43.467
<i>He came to recognize Pablo's voice.</i>

402
00:31:43.602 --> 00:31:46.470
<i>his sleep patterns.
what he liked to eat.</i>

403
00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:50.064
<i>his tastes in art.
his love of silk sheets.</i>

404
00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:51.609
<i>and his favorite music.</i>

405
00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:06.086
<i>He would die
for the love of his wife</i>

406
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:07.711
<i>when you'd hear him over the airwaves.</i>

407
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.296
<i>But did she know
how easily he ordered his men to kill?</i>

408
00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:19.095
<i>He came to understand
that Pablo spoke in code.</i>

409
00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:20.748
Time to thin the herd.

410
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:24.004
<i>"Cattle" were judges
or politicians who supported extradition.</i>

411
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.006
But did we score a goal?

412
00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:28.184
The reporter. right.

413
00:32:30.382 --> 00:32:32.647
Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

414
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.844
<i>A "goal" was a targeted assassination.</i>

415
00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:36.854
Come on. come on.

416
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.424
<i>If you spoke out against him.
you were dead.</i>

417
00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:41.618
<i>- The list grew by the week.</i>
- Ooh!

418
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.922
<i>Guillermo Cano. editor of</i> El Espectador.

419
00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:48.364
<i>and his reporter. Luis Camacho.</i>

420
00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:53.834
<i>Jaime Rodríguez. the former head
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.</i>

421
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:56.373
<i>The drumbeat went on and on.</i>

422
00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:59.171
<i>For Carrillo.
the war had already started.</i>

423
00:32:59.311 --> 00:33:01.177
<i>But he just couldn't trust his army.</i>

424
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:04.715
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

425
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.546
- I don't give a fuck.
- Excuse me?

426
00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:09.553
Horacio... don't give up.

427
00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:14.119
You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

428
00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:16.404
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

429
00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:18.454
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

430
00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.828
I'm not here for fun.

431
00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.612
What's gonna happen
is the defense minister

432
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:26.035
will give you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

433
00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:30.165
So... then if you resign.
I will look really bad.

434
00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:32.369
Is that what you're doing?
Is that what you want?

435
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:34.571
Horacio...
you remember when were cadets.

436
00:33:34.713 --> 00:33:39.378
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

437
00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:43.313
Horacio. as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

438
00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:45.913
Rodrigo. I don't even know who Pablo pays.

439
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.316
It could be any of us three.

440
00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:53.054
- Horacio. please.
- I've put my family at risk.

441
00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:56.691
If there is going to be a war.
I need the right tools.

442
00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.662
All right.

443
00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:01.000
Perfect.

444
00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.667
Then tell me what you need.
Hm?

445
00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:08.538
Incorruptible men.

446
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.443
<i>And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.</i>

447
00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:27.592
<i>But Carrillo
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.</i>

448
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:36.773
Hey. punk.
Are you all right?

449
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:38.934
- Sure.
- Come here.

450
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.777
<i>La Quica and Poison
had kids deliver packages.</i>

451
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.406
<i>And if they didn't look inside.</i>

452
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.280
<i>it meant they could be trusted
to deliver anything from cocaine to...</i>

453
00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:51.655
<i>well. anything else.</i>

454
00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.830
How are you. son?

455
00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:12.477
- How are you?
- Good.

456
00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.461
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

457
00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:39.796
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

458
00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:43.341
- I've tried. believe me.
- Then offer more.

459
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:48.879
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

460
00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:53.975
That's true.

461
00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:00.288
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

462
00:36:00.392 --> 00:36:05.353
Speaking of lead.
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

463
00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.295
Uzis. grenades...

464
00:36:07.399 --> 00:36:13.305
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

465
00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:16.466
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

466
00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.837
- Boss.
- Eh?

467
00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.344
<i>This is crack cocaine.
seized a few days ago</i>

468
00:36:21.446 --> 00:36:23.574
<i>by drug enforcement agents.</i>

469
00:36:23.715 --> 00:36:26.879
<i>in a park just across the street
from the White House.</i>

470
00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:30.350
<i>And our message
to the drug cartels is this:</i>

471
00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:32.056
<i>the rules have changed.</i>

472
00:36:32.257 --> 00:36:34.577
He's bullshitting. right?

473
00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:38.825
He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

474
00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:43.595
Motherfucker.

475
00:36:45.804 --> 00:36:47.773
Mm...

476
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.773
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

477
00:36:56.915 --> 00:36:58.178
They want us to move.

478
00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:02.751
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

479
00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.378
That's what scares them.

480
00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:09.427
Come here.

481
00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.888
It won't always be like this.
my love.

482
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.383
- Rodrigo.
- Hello. Horacio.

483
00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:42.393
- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

484
00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:44.053
Yes. sure. Come in. come in.

485
00:37:45.864 --> 00:37:47.664
<i>Let's talk about the incorruptibles.</i>

486
00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:50.800
I'm listening.

487
00:37:58.176 --> 00:38:02.170
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations.

488
00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:05.772
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

489
00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:09.613
Horacio... that's US dollars.
not pesos.

490
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.018
Instructed by whom?

491
00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:17.928
I think you can guess.

492
00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:21.258
Say the name.

493
00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:23.094
You know who.

494
00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:25.765
Say the name. Rodrigo.

495
00:38:30.542 --> 00:38:31.703
Escobar.

496
00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:41.351
Don't look at me like that. Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

497
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.821
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

498
00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.319
This man has tentacles.

499
00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:53.227
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

500
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.293
Get out.

501
00:38:58.603 --> 00:39:00.162
Horacio. please...

502
00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:09.806
Horacio...

503
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.819
Take care.

504
00:39:26.598 --> 00:39:30.035
I was driving to the church.

505
00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.865
Was with my buddy. John.
He was my best man.

506
00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:36.939
We were late.

507
00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:40.068
It was fucking blazing outside.
110 degrees.

508
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:43.340
Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off. I'm sure.

509
00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:48.181
And all of a sudden. I stopped the car.

510
00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:50.278
Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

511
00:39:51.256 --> 00:39:53.216
I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

512
00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:59.360
Well. you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

513
00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:03.094
Yeah. she forgave me. Eventually.

514
00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:06.693
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

515
00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.638
Randy... I think.

516
00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.306
Trust me. she's better off.

517
00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:21.786
What if Father Sobrino talks?

518
00:40:23.688 --> 00:40:25.213
He's gonna talk.

519
00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.519
It's about time. Navegante.

520
00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:04.928
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

521
00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:06.995
What do you got?

522
00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:10.425
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

523
00:41:15.073 --> 00:41:16.803
I can help you get him.

524
00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:19.468
You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

525
00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:22.976
I guess is your lucky day.

526
00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:32.723
- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

527
00:41:32.924 --> 00:41:36.292
The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

528
00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:39.193
He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

529
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.198
- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

530
00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:49.636
Peña. you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

531
00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:53.337
We want this man captured alive.
if possible.

532
00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:54.742
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

533
00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.209
Gaviria's press conference is tonight.

534
00:41:57.348 --> 00:42:01.149
and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say. he gets to say it.

535
00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:04.889
Yes. ma'am.

536
00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:07.254
That's a beautiful dress.
Ambassador Noonan.

537
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.428
Come on. Father. Ah. yeah. Talk!

538
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.097
Huh?

539
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.075
Huh?

540
00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:27.335
More? You want more?

541
00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:30.779
No! No more. please! No more!

542
00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:33.009
No more!

543
00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:35.584
Ah. he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

544
00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:37.714
Father...

545
00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:42.091
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

546
00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:53.594
She left with the American woman.

547
00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:58.575
Murphy's wife.

548
00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:04.240
I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

549
00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.317
Have you actually met a communist?

550
00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:08.784
Yeah. I have. actually...
and she lied to me.

551
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.718
Well. I'm not a communist. Connie.

552
00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:14.323
I'm fighting against poverty.
corruption. injustice and greed.

553
00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:17.061
But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

554
00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.424
Don't we?

555
00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.054
It's not the same.

556
00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.395
Look. I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

557
00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:25.097
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:27.135
Perhaps I should go.

559
00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:32.140
You can't just go.
Look. if they find you. they'll kill you.

560
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:37.140
I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

561
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.807
And I was hoping
to do something good.

562
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:44.821
But instead. I fell into something...
else. something more violent.

563
00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:48.751
Yeah. that makes two of us.

564
00:43:54.866 --> 00:43:56.129
I'll see you when I get home.

565
00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:03.865
Here. Elisa's ID.

566
00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:07.035
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

567
00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:08.646
My contact there agreed to hide her.

568
00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.146
While you go to Cartagena?

569
00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:12.342
I can't believe this shit.

570
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.146
- Who made this?
- Brother. what do you suggest we do?

571
00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:16.687
Jump out of a window?

572
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.453
Look. she's...

573
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:24.962
- She's important.
- To who?

574
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.193
To us.

575
00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:39.370
I take care of Elisa...
you better fucking get Gacha.

576
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:49.821
Finally. a romantic date.

577
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:52.533
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

578
00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:58.019
Mm. Just you. me...
and our bodyguard.

579
00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:04.663
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

580
00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:08.228
- Mm. My father adored you.
- Yeah. right.

581
00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:30.219
Garcia...

582
00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.774
Hello? Yes.

583
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.411
Yes.

584
00:45:56.287 --> 00:45:57.778
But he's all right?

585
00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:02.123
All right.

586
00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.473
Ana?

587
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:32.622
Ana?

588
00:46:41.966 --> 00:46:43.127
Ana?

589
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:48.498
Ana!

590
00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:55.976
A little bird... came into the house.

591
00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.673
I'm helping it out.

592
00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:10.120
What?

593
00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:17.459
There was an assassination attempt...

594
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.005
on Colonel Carrillo.

595
00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:23.369
Did someone die?

596
00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:27.009
One of his men.

597
00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:31.344
It must be terrible.

598
00:47:31.449 --> 00:47:33.645
the position you're in.

599
00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:37.016
I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

600
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.588
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

601
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:46.888
That fear keeps you alive.

602
00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:51.024
That's what none of them understand.

603
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:58.398
I will support any decision you make.

604
00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:09.615
<i>It's been said that
nothing gives the fearful more courage...</i>

605
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.546
<i>than another's fear.</i>

606
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:21.194
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.</i>

607
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:26.102
<i>And now. it was Gaviria's turn.</i>

608
00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:31.242
Welcome. American press.

609
00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:34.312
Tonight. I have the great pleasure

610
00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:38.413
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

611
00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:02.295
It has long been
our government's policy...

612
00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:09.944
to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

613
00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.312
So...

614
00:49:33.838 --> 00:49:35.329
Colombians say...

615
00:49:37.308 --> 00:49:39.800
God made our land so beautiful...

616
00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:43.380
it was unfair to the rest of the world.

617
00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:47.282
So to even the score...

618
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:54.349
God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

619
00:49:57.394 --> 00:50:02.799
<i>The primary impediment
to a free and uninhibited future</i>

620
00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:08.836
<i>is the violence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.</i>

621
00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:15.008
A violence initiated by these evil men...

622
00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:18.514
will be brought to justice...

623
00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:23.078
in the name of decency...

624
00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:28.192
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

625
00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.826
<i>We will extradite.</i>

626
00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:36.056
<i>This decision...
will not come from fear.</i>

627
00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:40.998
It has come from a clarity of judgment...

628
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:45.874
free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

629
00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.410
and obscures our view.

630
00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.541
I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

631
00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:01.584
There will be a future.

632
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.629
Thank you.

633
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.345
<i>Hello?</i>

634
00:52:02.553 --> 00:52:04.784
You think you're hot shit?

635
00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:07.255
You should change your satellite phone.

636
00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.525
Who is this?

637
00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:14.189
<i>Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.</i>

638
00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:18.632
<i>And your wife was at Carrera 1 1 today.
shopping for clothes.</i>

639
00:52:18.736 --> 00:52:21.763
You bastard son of a bitch.
you think that...

640
00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:24.671
What. you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

641
00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:28.006
<i>You know where my family is. fag.
well. I know where yours is. too.</i>

642
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:30.190
<i>- Don't forget that.</i>
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

643
00:52:30.214 --> 00:52:32.342
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

644
00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:35.180
I could have had you living like a king.
But now. guess what?

645
00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:40.690
Time to kill your dad. your mom.
your kids. your entire family.

646
00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.986
and you should be smart enough to realize

647
00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:47.554
I have each and every one of them
under watch. you fucking bastard.

648
00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:50.167
<i>Not everyone's for sale. Pablo.</i>

649
00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:53.066
<i>You just keep hiding.
and I will find you.</i>

650
00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.535
<i>Don't know when...</i>

651
00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:56.536
but I will find you.

652
00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.002
And when I find you...

653
00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:01.888
- I'm going to kill you.
<i>- I'm going to kill you</i>

654
00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:04.313
and your entire family.
you son of a bitch!

655
00:53:25.736 --> 00:53:27.762
It's war. then.

655
00:53:28.305 --> 00:54:28.687
