00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.620
STRATEGY MEETING

3
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.670
STRATEGY MEETING
Just when we thought damage
to the city would be inevitable

4
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.460
STRATEGY MEETING
a powerful attack pulverized
that giant creature.

5
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.090
a powerful attack pulverized
that giant creature.

6
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.260
So you're saying Centichoro
disappeared without a trace?

7
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.140
It's hard to believe. but this is
a feat only King could pull off.

8
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.180
We are incredibly lucky to
have King as our ally.

9
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.310
As for the Hero Hunter. I hear
Silverfang failed to capture him.

10
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.650
What do you plan to do
about this. Sitch?

11
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.690
If he continues to
hunt heroes like this

12
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.280
the Hero Association
will cease to function.

13
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.080
You must no longer view Garou
as a human. but as a monster.

14
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.200
The next time he appears...

15
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.330
He will be categorized as
threat level Dragon

16
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.620
and an emergency alert
must be issued.

17
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.290
But in reality.
he's still a human. right?

18
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.380
Could any normal person actually

19
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.970
stand up to our Class-S heroes
barehanded?

20
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.420
Just think about it.

21
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.590
Maybe the strategy's the problem?

22
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.180
"Our" Class-S heroes?

23
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.350
Even at this stage

24
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.140
he is treating this
as some kind of business.

25
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.100
It was unexpected that Silverfang
failed to finish off Garou

26
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.730
but he did manage to
leave him severely injured.

27
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.070
At least this means
Garou likely won't bolster

28
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.780
the Monster Association's forces.

29
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.280
If nothing else.
we can count that as a win.

30
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.530
Get Blast over here!
Blast. I say!

31
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.450
He's a top-ranker. but he's
not doing anything at all. is he?

32
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.830
It's impossible
to give Blast orders.

33
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.040
He only operates
as a hero voluntarily.

34
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.420
He refuses to be bound by anyone
and dislikes drawing attention

35
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.050
so even in the registry.
his identity is undisclosed.

36
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.470
But that's because we believe he's
worthy of this special treatment.

37
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.310
However. if humanity really needs help

38
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.190
I'm sure he'll take action.

39
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.850
What do you mean?!

40
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.360
That time is now!
A monster abducted my son!

41
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.400
It's been 24 hours since then.

42
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.700
Why haven't you attacked?

43
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.410
I give you my word.
We will save your son.

44
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.990
And you are...?

45
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.330
I'll be commanding
this rescue operation.

46
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.290
My name is Sekingal.

47
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.630
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

48
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.210
Huh?

49
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.960
What operation?

50
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.300
I'll just sweep in and
take care of things in no time.

51
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.350
Do we know where the hideout is?

52
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.640
Child Emperor is working
at full speed on it right now.

53
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.270
I have surveillance robots probing
Centichoro's underground route.

54
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.940
But the area is huge...
we have three days. right?

55
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.030
We only have two days left.

56
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.440
Ugh...
No sleep for me!

57
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.490
The hideout is somewhere
in City Z's ghost town. right?

58
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.870
KABOOM
Shall I just wipe it out?

59
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.990
KABOOM

60
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.000
KABOOM
We must tread carefully
since there is a hostage.

61
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.580
Sounds like a pain in the neck.

62
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.630
If they hadn't done that
they'd have no chance against me.

63
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.500
The monsters must be afraid of me.

64
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.590
The opponents
are pretty formidable.

65
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.010
Yeah. whatever.

66
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.010
Did you call us here just
to give us that warning?

67
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.560
Actually yesterday...

68
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.310
Drive Knight forcibly continued
the investigation on his own.

69
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.190
He ignored our warnings and
entered the ghost town ahead of us.

70
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.070
Why would he go alone?!

71
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.200
He's never lost a battle.
so he must've been confident.

72
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.910
But since last night

73
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.990
we haven't been able to pick up
a signal from his transmitter.

74
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.620
I think it's safe to assume that
Drive Knight has been defeated.

75
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.830
I don't care either way.

76
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.630
You'd better hurry up and
assemble your team.

77
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.170
Who's left?

78
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.840
The Monster Association gave us
a three-day ultimatum.

79
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.220
We still have time.

80
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.640
As soon as the other heroes
are ready. they will rush over too.

81
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.400
Still on standby?
What's going on?

82
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.190
A child is being held hostage?

83
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.150
You didn't know about that.
Atomic Samurai?

84
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.610
You also reek of blood.

85
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.570
Since yesterday. I've been
scouring mountains and caves

86
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.160
looking for hidden monsters and
slashing 'em up. left. and right.

87
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.830
Unfortunately.
I wasn't able to find

88
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.880
the Monster Association's
hideout though.

89
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.460
Yeah. makes sense.

90
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.130
I hear the Monster Association's
hideout is in the ghost town.

91
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.670
What?!
We know that much?

92
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.680
Well. fighting head-on at
the hideout sounds easy enough.

93
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.640
I suggest we all
get some rest till then.

94
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.100
- Okay.
- I'm going to take a shower.

95
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.850
Oh my!

96
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.020
I heard the assault team would
be made up of an elite few. but...

97
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.440
For some reason. there are
some here who don't fit the bill.

98
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.400
This is not a picnic.

99
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.240
How about we refrain from bringing
our fun friends. Atomic Samurai?

100
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.910
I'd like the small fry to stick
to fighting other small fry.

101
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.210
You got that?

102
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.960
It wouldn't be so bad
if they just die

103
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.420
but what if they're taken as
hostages or used as human shields?

104
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.460
That would be a major hassle.

105
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.630
If that ever happens

106
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.300
can you give them the orders
to commit harakiri?

107
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.300
Hey. take it easy. Mr. Handsome...

108
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.010
Amai Mask. are you on the team?

109
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.690
Of course. Those monsters
interrupted my concert.

110
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.610
I see. My disciples are tough.
you know.

111
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.490
I'll tell them to protect
the pretty boy idol

112
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.700
when he gets in trouble.

113
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.660
So relax.

114
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.200
In trouble?

115
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.160
I can't believe there are people

116
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.750
who still doubt
my combat abilities.

117
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.710
I only stay in Class A because
it's easier to oversee everything.

118
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.670
I can move up to Class S
at any time.

119
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.460
Mm. let's see now.

120
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.220
To put it simply.
so an imbecile can understand...

121
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.220
I'm stronger than you.

122
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.720
Hm? Oh yeah?

123
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.230
Master! Keep your cool!

124
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.980
Warden. you sure I can just walk
right out the front door?

125
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.900
This is an extra-legal measure.

126
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.450
Let me remind you that

127
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.160
every time you've broken
out of prison to do hero work

128
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.870
that's all been illegal activity.

129
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.740
I don't like how
the Hero Association

130
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.210
gives a guy like you
preferential treatment.

131
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.420
But just this once.
I can't afford to say that.

132
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.550
There was a single cat-like monster

133
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.420
who turned some of the prisoners
into monsters and took them away.

134
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.260
Many officers who fought back
lost their lives.

135
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.760
You're a hero out there.
aren't you?

136
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.720
Isn't that right.
boss of the prisoners?

137
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.020
Get revenge for us!

138
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.060
Leave it to me.

139
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.070
I'll make them pay dearly

140
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.070
for wrecking this place
while I was gone.

141
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.610
Hang on. Boss!

142
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.120
I knitted a sweater for you.

143
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.950
Please wear it if you like.

144
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.000
Thank you.
This will give me courage.

145
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.630
Hey.

146
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.880
You mind leaving the room?

147
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.800
I can't focus with
you all staring at me.

148
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.800
Metal Knight.

149
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.680
I know you're pretending
not to be there. Please answer.

150
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.930
What...?

151
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.230
I feel like I'm wasting
a lot of time and effort.

152
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.980
I'm sure you've figured out
where the hideout is by now. right?

153
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.740
Please tell me.
We're running out of time.

154
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.650
Are you going to
let the hostage die?

155
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.030
By not telling you.
the hostage might die.

156
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.540
But if I do tell you

157
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.120
I bring death to not only
the hostage. but to all of you.

158
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.420
I will make a rational choice
based on justice.

159
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.750
There's another option.

160
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.710
You can join the operation.

161
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.680
What are you so afraid of?

162
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.640
What is the state of
your machine body right now?

163
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.520
If it has been destroyed. which
monster did that to you and how?

164
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.890
Monster King Orochi.

165
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.190
It was just one strike.

166
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.150
The arm I used to
guard myself was destroyed.

167
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.360
Even the self-destruction device
was disabled.

168
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.610
It's not the Monster Association
I'm afraid of...

169
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.200
Evil powers are

170
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.580
watching for their chance to
take over the world.

171
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.240
When humanity's defenses
become weak

172
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.250
they'll strike all at once
to take everything.

173
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.370
Be careful.

174
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.130
Don't trust anyone around you.

175
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.250
If you want to enforce justice
do it alone.

176
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.840
Build up your strength...

177
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.050
And save it for the right time.
Child Emperor.

178
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.230
The Hero Association is useless.

179
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.520
Listen up. all of you!

180
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.150
Even as I speak

181
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.520
my son is trembling in fear
as he waits for help.

182
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.230
Head over to the abandoned area
of City Z immediately

183
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.940
and find the Monsters' hideout!

184
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.700
And rescue my son!

185
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.910
The battle suits you are wearing

186
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.070
are secret weapons
obtained from special channels.

187
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.950
The performance of these suits

188
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.830
easily surpass the power
of any professional hero.

189
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.330
NARINKI PRIVATE FORCE

190
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.080
NARINKI PRIVATE FORCE
Make full use of your battle suits

191
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:44.210
NARINKI PRIVATE FORCE

192
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.170
NARINKI PRIVATE FORCE
and exterminate
every single monster you encounter.

193
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:46.210
and exterminate
every single monster you encounter.

194
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.880
I'll pay whatever you name
for the success fee!

195
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.840
Bring back Waganma alive

196
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.880
and you will live in
luxury for generations to come!

197
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:53.970
Go!!

198
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.680
I'm pretty sure
it's that small building.

199
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.900
I got you cornered!

200
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.110
The Blizzard Bunch
has been wiped out.

201
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.610
Well. half of it
is my sister's fault.

202
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.990
This is an emergency.

203
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.490
I need to use this place
as a branch office

204
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.410
of the Blizzard Bunch
to hold a meeting.

205
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.160
Yes?

206
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.830
Saita...
Wait. who are you?

207
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.410
Oh? A friend?

208
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.380
You have a visitor. Saitama!

209
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.050
Blizzard's here again.

210
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.840
Hey. how come the monster I raised

211
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.180
died right away
with just a single hit of yours?

212
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.350
What do you want. Hellish Blizzard?

213
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.560
Master is not
taking any new disciples.

214
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.180
Sorry. it's so cramped.

215
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.890
Would you hand me that poultice?

216
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.400
Why would wind be earth's weakness?

217
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.980
But I'm at level 27
and you're at level 15. you know.

218
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.650
Even if you're at
the highest level

219
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.280
Old Man Golem can't beat
Meow-Meow types.

220
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.200
It's a weak character
to begin with.

221
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.450
What? You should've
told me that sooner!

222
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.660
- This Armpit character...
- That one's weak too.

223
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.290
Actually. only the cute characters
are strong.

224
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.580
Oh. forget it.
That just ruined it for me.

225
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.380
What is going on?

226
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.880
Hm? Why are you here?

227
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.210
It's an emergency.

228
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.460
The Blizzard Bunch got wiped out!

229
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.840
The Monster Organization is
extremely dangerous.

230
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.050
This is no time
to be playing games.

231
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.470
Do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

232
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.720
You don't need to yell.

233
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.020
I just got home a while ago and
was taking a short break.

234
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.400
Don't lie down!

235
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.440
Just like Master said. we were
also facing some tough opponents.

236
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.480
Don't think you guys
were the only ones.

237
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.990
Yeah. I can tell
from the way you look.

238
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.700
I know King was here before

239
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.700
but what's Silverfang
doing here now?

240
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:50.330
I fought alongside them.
so Saitama is letting me rest here.

241
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.290
I got a little carried away

242
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.420
threw my back out.
and now I can't move.

243
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.090
My knees gave out.

244
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.430
Using Fist of Roaring Qi. Rending Air
after so long took its toll.

245
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.010
I see. it must have been
quite a battle.

246
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.180
Yet why?
Why is this guy the same as usual?

247
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.730
Hey Saitama!
You're acting all cool and calm

248
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.350
but you're actually panicking. right?

249
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.270
Not really...
it's just the same as usual.

250
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.440
What?

251
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.820
There's no way this situation
is the same as usual!

252
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.940
Why is she getting mad?

253
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.070
I hate to break it to you

254
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.070
but this situation
is not the same as usual.

255
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.370
BAM BAM
Come sit!

256
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:24.780
Come sit!

257
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.450
We're going to have
a strategy meeting right now!

258
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.540
BAM BAM
We're going to have
a strategy meeting right now!

259
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.870
Seriously. why are you here?

260
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.620
Genos! You're Class S.

261
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.960
The Hero Association executives
haven't told you about their next moves?

262
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.880
I was supporting
Master Saitama yesterday

263
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.050
at a martial arts tournament
and also in a battle myself.

264
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.550
Not to mention.
the transmitter for the Association

265
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.260
got melted and was destroyed.

266
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.430
I dropped mine
into a crack in the ground.

267
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.770
I noticed mine was broken too.

268
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.440
It might have been because of the
shockwaves from Saitama's punch.

269
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.230
So what's our next move?

270
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.730
We're on the brink of war
with the monsters.

271
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.990
I need to undergo
some repairs first.

272
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.070
Well. obviously.

273
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.870
We're gonna need time to recover

274
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.280
before we can
get back into action again.

275
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.870
You can't beat age.

276
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.290
What about you. King?

277
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.120
I think there's some other business
I have to tend to...

278
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.500
So Saitama and I are the only ones
who are ready to go.

279
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.590
So what do you say?

280
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.010
Headquarters probably
has its own special task force

281
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.800
that's devising a plan.

282
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.720
But at times like this. actions
taken by Class-B heroes and below

283
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.890
can affect their future evaluation.

284
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.310
So we should try to
do something to contribute.

285
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:31.850
DAZE

286
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:32.810
DAZE
Are you listening?

287
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.850
This time. the enemy is

288
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.230
a large group of monsters
that usually act independently

289
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.690
but they have formed an alliance
which is unusual.

290
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.570
However. their organizational structure

291
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.030
likely is more about domination
than cooperation

292
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.330
with a boss giving orders.

293
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.120
Right. a monster group.

294
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.170
If Garou's joined up with them.
that's gonna be trouble.

295
00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.000
Yeah. we may never get another
chance to fight Garou alone.

296
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.760
If they still have any monsters

297
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.510
as strong as that centipede
on their side

298
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.470
it's not looking good.

299
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.890
Might as well quit
being a hero. Bang.

300
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.180
Saitama.

301
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.720
Looks like the Hero Hunter
you've been wanting to meet

302
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.810
was at that scene.

303
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.730
You just missed him.

304
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.020
On my way home. I heard that
he hunted down more heroes.

305
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.400
That's unforgivable.

306
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.280
Especially since
he hasn't come for me yet.

307
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.820
Is it because I'm the Caped Baldy?

308
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.830
- Saitama?
- Master?

309
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.040
I'm going out for a bit.

310
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.660
Do you know where Garou is?

311
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.160
I'm gonna look for him.

312
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.580
When I find Garou. I'll punch him.

313
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.920
I'll also buy
napa cabbage on the way back.

314
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.890
Here I was calling the shots.
but I'm left out in the cold again...

315
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.510
Trying to get Saitama
and his crew

316
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.470
to join the Blizzard Bunch
will not be easy.

317
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.570
Where am I?
Did I survive?

318
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.280
My memory is a bit fuzzy.

319
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.540
Welcome to the Monster Association.

320
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.870
The fact that you are reading this
means you survived.

321
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.300
Be aware that we are the ones
who saved your life.

322
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.300
So wait quietly in this room
without causing any trouble.

323
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.840
Going outside right now will only
make you a target for heroes.

324
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.970
What you need is a place to belong.

325
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.270
There's a change of clothes.
Please feel free to use them.

326
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.150
Oww... It hurts like hell!!
My whole body!

327
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.780
I'm thirsty. And I need food...

328
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.740
...to replenish my blood.

329
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.370
I was fighting the old man.
then that bird guy appeared...

330
00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.210
The Monster Association...
They get on my nerves.

331
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.370
What happened to the old man?

332
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.330
He was fighting that centipede...

333
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.340
Oh well. who cares...

334
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.090
The smell of blood permeates
the stagnant air.

335
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.430
Makes me wanna puke.

336
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.430
And it's so quiet.
my ears are ringing.

337
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.560
Am I deep underground?

338
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.640
Who cares...

339
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.270
Please have mercy!
We were wrong!

340
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.730
We'll never defy you ever again!

341
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.150
Noo. I don't want to die!

342
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.610
But you took out
two of my soldiers.

343
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.280
I can't just let you
walk out of here.

344
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.450
Your employer equipped you
with powerful gear

345
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.250
so you'd better fight till the end.

346
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.380
Everyone here just loves turning anyone
who resists into a plaything.

347
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.500
Grr...
It's all his fault.

348
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.670
Dammit. If that freak robot
hadn't shown up

349
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.380
we could've escaped to the surface.

350
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.550
Looks like the advertising worked.

351
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.390
Thanks for the gift.

352
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.520
I'm glad a capable
new recruit came to us.

353
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.390
You pass with flying colors.

354
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.940
What is your name. newbie?

355
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.230
I am Machine God G5.

356
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.650
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
MACHINE GOD G5

357
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.740
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
MACHINE GOD G5
I was deployed by the organization
to aid the Monster Association.

358
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.070
"Organization"?

359
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.990
How did you get to this hideout
without getting lost?

360
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.740
Can I talk to your creator?

361
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.830
So be it.
In any case. we welcome you.

362
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.460
Besides.
we have another arrival anyway.

363
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.960
Stay hidden
and wait a little longer. Garou.

364
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.000
A voice directly in my head!
Is it telepathy?

365
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.800
Having fought them myself.
I can say that

366
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.180
their battle suits have
extremely high combat capabilities

367
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.720
and are highly valuable.

368
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.310
However. they appear to be
customized for each individual.

369
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.440
So no one else. let alone a monster.
would be able to use them.

370
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.610
In other words. we should let them
live and use them as pawns.

371
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.860
Then. you're mine.
I'll train you well.

372
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.910
Train?
What on earth?

373
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.450
Please just let us go!

374
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.200
Quiet!

375
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.130
Excellent! I'm lucky to
have such promising slaves!

376
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.060
Hey. Garou. You're up early.

377
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.940
- So that's the Hero Hunter.
- He got rescued...

378
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.820
- I like him.
- ...and treated for his injuries.

379
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.820
Why did Gyoro-Gyoro
take interest in a mere human?

380
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.070
- Is he human? A monster?
- Silence!

381
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.700
I'm going to have an important talk
with him now.

382
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.410
What the heck is that giant
in the back?

383
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.870
What do you want me to do?

384
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.080
After the recent battle.
there are fewer than 30 remaining

385
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.750
threat-level Demon or higher
monsters left.

386
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.010
Even so.
we are still strong enough to win.

387
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.890
But what we lack right now
is unity...and a leader.

388
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.220
I'd like you to become a member
of the leadership and assist me.

389
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.220
A leader already?

390
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.640
That's a pretty sweet deal.

391
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.520
I was looking for someone

392
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.150
with a strong anti-hero ideology
like him.

393
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.740
He's a lone wolf.
but even if he is battered

394
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.860
the way he goes for the jugular
against Class-S heroes

395
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.070
is truly praiseworthy.

396
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.830
However. our boss. Lord Orochi.
has one condition.

397
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.040
Prove that you are a true monster.

398
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.750
You want me to grow a horn?

399
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.380
You have one day.

400
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.880
I don't care who it is.
Bring me the head of a hero.

401
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.880
If it's a hero's life you want...

402
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.760
Hate to give you the bad news

403
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.140
but Silverfang and his buddies
are alive.

404
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.180
Centichoro was defeated.

405
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.310
Sorry to bother you.
I have a favor to ask you.

406
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.190
Hmph. what do you want?

407
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.570
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
INSECT GOD
Hmph. what do you want?

408
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.360
I want so badly to hear
a human scream.

409
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.940
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
KING THE RIPPER
I want so badly to hear
a human scream.

410
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.070
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
KING THE RIPPER

411
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.320
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
KING THE RIPPER
I'm about to lose my mind.
Hurry up.

412
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.490
Garou went outside.

413
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.660
Follow him.

414
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.710
Yesterday. it was Goketsu.

415
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.210
And today. Centichoro was defeated.

416
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.550
Yeah. I bet even Gyoro-Gyoro
didn't expect two top monsters

417
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.550
to go down
before the decisive battle.

418
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.060
Is that why he's trying to recruit
the Hero Hunter?

419
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.680
So he can be
one of the key warriors?

420
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.020
I can't read Gyoro-Gyoro.

421
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.270
Not like I'm interested
or anything.

422
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.770
As long as I can destroy
the Hero Association and Flash

423
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:58.610
I'm all good.

424
00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.150
We recruited

425
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.400
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic
but what happened to him?

426
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.030
I haven't seen him around.

427
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.450
Maybe he couldn't adapt
to the monster cells.

428
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.500
I suffered all night.
but I think the worst is over.

429
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.210
I hate those bastards from
the Monster Association.

430
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.540
No one told me my stomach
would get this upset.

431
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.130
I'll pay 'em back for this one day.

432
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.260
Whatever.

433
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.550
I never had any intention of
teaming up with the monsters.

434
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.140
I just wanted to
take advantage of them.

435
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.810
My only target is Saitama.

436
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.390
That being said...

437
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.940
I can feel it...a new power.

438
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.230
My body is definitely changing.

439
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.480
My body feels light.

440
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.110
It may take a while
to get used to it.

441
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.200
So this is monsterization?

442
00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.910
Not that it's anything special.

443
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:55.910
SONIC LOST TWO KILOGRAMS

444
00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:00.770
MONSTER TRAITS
