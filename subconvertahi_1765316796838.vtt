00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:18.144
Murphy. join t' party. huh?

2
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.025
What's wrong?

3
00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:26.235
All you guys having a good time?

4
00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.904
You gotta let it go. man.
There's good that came out of this.

5
00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.866
Yeah. we used him.
then we got him killed.

6
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.702
No. we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

7
00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.163
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

8
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.457
Look on the bright side. huh?

9
00:00:42.043 --> 00:00:45.380
Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

10
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.884
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

11
00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.303
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

12
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.684
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

13
00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:02.355
Finally. the Colombian government
had to react.

14
00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.483
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

15
00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:13.657
Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

16
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.412
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

17
00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.914
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US.

18
00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:22.499
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

19
00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.836
This made all the difference in the world.

20
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.839
If you were a narco in Colombia.

21
00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:31.759
jail time meant banging girls.
watching movies.

22
00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.552
hanging with the fellas...

23
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.639
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

24
00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:39.558
It was a fucking joke.

25
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.144
Back home.
it was a whole different deal.

26
00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:46.023
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

27
00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:50.403
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day.
just like every other loser.

28
00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.029
a fucking nightmare.

29
00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:55.950
Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.

30
00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:25.181

31
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.669
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

32
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.297
- With our help. you will.
- Oh. that's right.

33
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:34.882
Gringos to the rescue.

34
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.719
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

35
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:43.265
One man with helicopters. airplanes.
vehicles. planned escape routes.

36
00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.101
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money.

37
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.604
- men. weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

38
00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:52.733
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

39
00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.236
Help us catch him.

40
00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:59.323
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

41
00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:00.991
Let me take care of that.

42
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.954
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

43
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.547
Escobar will not go lightly.

44
00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:20.010
He will make Colombia bleed.

45
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.938
First. "Death to Kidnappers."
then "the Extraditables."

46
00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:18.360
Once again. the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.

47
00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:22.072
But it was not quite like
"one for all. and all for one."

48
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.827
It was more like each man for himself.

49
00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:32.541
Gacha. being Gacha. decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

50
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.671
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- Fire!

51
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.007
So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

52
00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:44.886
Lehder. being Lehder. got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

53
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.022
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

54
00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:08.994
As for the Ochoa brothers.
they went with a fancy PR firm

55
00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:12.623
and got ripped off because. well...
that's what PR agencies do.

56
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.693
By the way.
here's the logo $50.000 got you.

57
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.446
In the upcoming presidential election.
extradition became the defining issue

58
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.864
amongst the candidates.

59
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.534
Those the narcos could buy.
they bought.

60
00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:50.827
The ones they could scare.
they scared.

61
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.789
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

62
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.876
And so. unable to buy him
and unable to scare him.

63
00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.171
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery.

64
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.173
and he wrote Galán a letter.

65
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.970
"And to conclude. I want
to express my most energetic protest

66
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.766
over the improper interference
of North America

67
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.727
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

68
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.853
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

69
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:19.565
He's got some balls.

70
00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.358
Escobar is shameless.

71
00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:26.029
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency. Mr. Galán.

72
00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.157
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States.

73
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.119
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

74
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.080
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

75
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.041
My campaign manager.
Dr. Gaviria.

76
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.586
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

77
00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:44.673
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle.

78
00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:47.468
when clearly.
they're losing a war.

79
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.512
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

80
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:08.989
Since he couldn't get to Galán.

81
00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.826
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

82
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.745
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

83
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:16.955
if no judge was willing to apply it.

84
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.627
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

85
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.963
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States.

86
00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:28.425
know we. the Extraditables.
will pass judgment on you

87
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.094
and bring a sentence far harsher."

88
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.472
The judges were so scared and intimidated

89
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.308
that special court procedures
had to be created.

90
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.853
For the first time
in the history of Colombia.

91
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.814
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

92
00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:59.623
Despite his threats.
many brave men defied him.

93
00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:05.253
And true to form.
when the pen failed...

94
00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.339
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

95
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:16.348
In light of this terrorism.
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

96
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:20.268
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority. right?

97
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.770
Well. guess again.

98
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.733
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

99
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:29.444
All due respect. but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

100
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:33.240
We got FARC. we got M-19.
we got EPL. we got ELN.

101
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.868
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

102
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:39.705
Sorry. Agent Peña. but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems.

103
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.082
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

104
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.086
Communists. Remember them?

105
00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:50.591
With Reagan in the White House.
it was hard to forget.

106
00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:51.717
In his words:

107
00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:54.929
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

108
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.307
The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing. always had been.

109
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.937
In Hollywood. he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

110
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.022
In Washington.
he created the Reagan Doctrine.

111
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.776
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

112
00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:12.320
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

113
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.991
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world.

114
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.242
you'd better be chasing reds.

115
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.829
Ambassador. if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets.

116
00:10:20.913 --> 00:10:22.873
the Colombians will get Escobar.

117
00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:26.001
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

118
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.712
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

119
00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:33.884
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

120
00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:37.220
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker. and as such.

121
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:42.267
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

122
00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:47.522
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

123
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.232
Let the Colombians get him.

124
00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:53.403
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100.000

125
00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:56.657
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah. it's a fucking joke.

126
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.492
That's about what he spends on shoes.
isn't it?

127
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.662
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

128
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.163
So what do we do now?

129
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.749
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

130
00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:10.420
It's true.
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

131
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:13.256
But delivered into the right hands.
it could make a difference.

132
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:18.094
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia.
honorable men.

133
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:23.058
But the head of counternarcotics.
General Jaramillo. wasn't one of 'em.

134
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.271
And as such.
he was exactly what we needed.

135
00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:41.053
Hm.

136
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:02.657
Mm.

137
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.383
Your English is really good.

138
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.595
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

139
00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.305
How long you been at the comuna?

140
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.474
Just a few weeks.

141
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.102
Is your husband
gonna help us here. too?

142
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:15.522
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

143
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.360
Oh. he's. uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

144
00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.576
- I fucked up.
- How?

145
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.204
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

146
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.413
No. Jaramillo's sending a message.

147
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:37.169
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

148
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.796
He's setting Carrillo up for failure.
and when he does fail.

149
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.215
he'll fire him for incompetence.

150
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:44.092
and me and you.
we lose the only cop we can trust.

151
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:47.971
- Hey!
- Hey!

152
00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.764
- Sorry I'm late. honey.
- Mm...

153
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.309
Javier. this is my friend. Elisa.

154
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.187
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

155
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.312
Nice to meet you.

156
00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.817
Are you another... janitor at the embassy.
like Steve?

157
00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.986
No. actually. I'm CIA.

158
00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:06.489
But that's classified.
so don't tell anybody.

159
00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:10.118
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

160
00:15:10.202 --> 00:15:12.913
- The janitor thing. what. that was you?
- Mm.

161
00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.165
No. it's just a cover.

162
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.667
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

163
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.712
Just so you know.
I'm a communist guerrillera.

164
00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.007
Perfect.

165
00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.676
If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

166
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.304
we probably wouldn't have cared.

167
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.681
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

168
00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.851
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

169
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:37.979
He had better resources
and better information.

170
00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.523
And at the time.
he owned over 800 homes and fincas.

171
00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:43.610
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

172
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:47.281
And cops...
he owned a lot of them. too.

173
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:48.531
But not all of them.

174
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.078
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

175
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.705
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

176
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:58.041
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

177
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.753
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

178
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.382
Trapped a little bird.

179
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.094
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

180
00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.221
Jesus.

181
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.146
Just remember that you wanted all in.

182
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.495
He already gave up
the name of three fincas.

183
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.831
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

184
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.299
We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out.

185
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.927
but there was a small part of me
that thought. in his arrogance.

186
00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.138
he would stand and fight.

187
00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.682
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

188
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.100
I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

189
00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.644
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time.

190
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:33.107
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

191
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:37.278
You may have 800 houses. my friend.
but none of them is home.

192
00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:40.448
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life.

193
00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.493
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

194
00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:46.079
From now on.
nowhere is safe.

195
00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.517
The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

196
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.936
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

197
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:15.233
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

198
00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:20.029
Hey. if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out. too.

199
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:24.033
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

200
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.911
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

201
00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:29.497
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

202
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.670
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit.
I got very lucky.

203
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:40.467
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

204
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.303
We raided it.
and guess who we found?

205
00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:45.555
Blackbeard.

206
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:49.016
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

207
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.604
In custody.
he would describe a cocaine empire

208
00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:56.524
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

209
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:59.402
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

210
00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:03.823
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice.

211
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.117
home of Colombia's supreme court.

212
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.744
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

213
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:14.542
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

214
00:22:14.626 --> 00:22:16.002
Fuck.

215
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:19.797
Fuck.

216
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.924
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

217
00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:24.177
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

218
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.596
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

219
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.806
Javi. there's some good stuff in here.
stuff we can use.

220
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:31.058
None of it can leave the room.

221
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.936
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

222
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.856
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

223
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.609
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

224
00:22:45.657 --> 00:22:46.824
Take 'em.

225
00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.995
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

226
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.039
What are you talking about?

227
00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:55.583
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

228
00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.422
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

229
00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:03.966
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

230
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.760
They're not gonna
search a white boy. OK?

231
00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:08.095
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

232
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.263
Just do it.

233
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.893
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

234
00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:17.021
- And sometimes. bad people...
- Señor.

235
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:18.356
...help you do good things.

236
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.179
Wha... What the fuck is this?

237
00:24:32.263 --> 00:24:33.889
This is me giving you homework.

238
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.350
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

239
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.185
And I need you to find out who it is.

240
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:41.147
First off. I don't fucking work for you.
Murphy. you hear me?

241
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.108
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

242
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:48.655
What's he up to these days?

243
00:24:48.738 --> 00:24:50.030
Barry Seal.

244
00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.416
Barry Seal. a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football.

245
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.169
mind-altering chemicals.
and pussy...

246
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:05.797
which made him perfect CIA material.

247
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.092
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

248
00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:12.887
Finding Barry was easy.

249
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.056
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

250
00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:18.601
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite. too.

251
00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:21.270
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

252
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:24.691
No. I'm serious.

253
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:27.067
Look.

254
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:30.363
Oh. my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

255
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:38.412
- Goddamn. is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

256
00:25:39.664 --> 00:25:41.916
Come on. we got you a ride
waiting over here.

257
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:47.380
It's fun to say. though.
ain't it? "McPickle"?

258
00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:53.803
Have a seat. Barry.

259
00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:02.520
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

260
00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:05.314
Well. you guys ain't got shit.

261
00:26:05.398 --> 00:26:10.152
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

262
00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:12.238
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

263
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:17.034
Yeah? Well. let's see
if that holds up in court. huh?

264
00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:20.830
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

265
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:22.623
without making a refueling stop.

266
00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:26.043
Yeah. according to the records.
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

267
00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:28.671
The manifests don't lie.

268
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:32.884
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine.

269
00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:36.637
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department. wouldn't it?

270
00:26:36.721 --> 00:26:40.600
Well. damn...
you guys are good.

271
00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:42.017
Communist sympathizer.

272
00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.103
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big. red bow

273
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.980
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

274
00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:48.566
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments.

275
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:51.193
that's treason and trafficking.

276
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:53.654
What's that.
two life sentences for the price of one?

277
00:26:54.739 --> 00:26:55.865
That's right.

278
00:26:58.952 --> 00:27:02.997
Well... see.
I figured this day might come.

279
00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:06.125
Why don't you uncuff me. boys.
I got something to show you.

280
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.334
Yeah? What's that?

281
00:27:07.418 --> 00:27:10.129
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

282
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:13.591
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on. uncuff me.

283
00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:16.176
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

284
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.222
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

285
00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:24.351
'Cause at the time. Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas.

286
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:27.229
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

287
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:30.024
for cocaine shipments to the US.

288
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:34.153
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

289
00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:35.571
I couldn't have made that up.

290
00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:37.531
- Holy shit.
- It was too good.

291
00:27:37.615 --> 00:27:40.409
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait. wait. wait. No.

292
00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:43.245
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

293
00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.791
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

294
00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:49.043
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

295
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:52.588
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

296
00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:54.924
- You know. I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

297
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:58.511
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

298
00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:11.148
I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants.

299
00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:14.318
but frankly.
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

300
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:16.278
He was just another busted trafficker

301
00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:19.949
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

302
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:23.661
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

303
00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:26.914
to get the resources we needed.
then fuck him.

304
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.333
Strange bedfellows. indeed.

305
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:33.170
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

306
00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:35.339
Washington is gonna go crazy.

307
00:28:36.173 --> 00:28:37.842
Thank you. Ambassador.

308
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:42.262
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

309
00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:43.472
Of course.

310
00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:46.767
Thank you.

311
00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:53.774
In Washington. "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

312
00:28:53.983 --> 00:28:57.862
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

313
00:28:58.071 --> 00:29:00.865
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

314
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:05.369
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

315
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:08.622
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

316
00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:11.959
This picture shows Federico Vaughan.

317
00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:15.880
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua.

318
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:20.927
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

319
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:26.223
No. there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

320
00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:29.560
Being a rat is a dangerous business.

321
00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:31.771
and Escobar's reach was long.

322
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:34.481
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

323
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.695
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

324
00:29:39.904 --> 00:29:41.196
Whoops.

325
00:29:48.162 --> 00:29:50.706
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

326
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.918
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña. if he wanted a long life.

327
00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:56.754
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

328
00:29:56.963 --> 00:29:59.590
I didn't kill him. Escobar did.

329
00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:02.885
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

330
00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:05.138
Look on the bright side. man.

331
00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:09.100
From then on. according to Reagan.

332
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:12.645
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

333
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:16.356
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

334
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.401
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

335
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.906
planes. helicopters.
you fucking name it. Everything.

336
00:30:28.786 --> 00:30:33.124
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

337
00:30:33.207 --> 00:30:37.753
and burn 'em straight to the ground.
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

338
00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:40.881
We were kicking ass.
and the narcos were feeling it.

339
00:30:41.632 --> 00:30:44.426
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

340
00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:48.806
Despite all this. we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

341
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:52.601
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether.

342
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.436
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

343
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:55.562
Got it!

344
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:59.817
The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia.

345
00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:03.362
Medellín's biggest processing lab.
and we hit it hard.

346
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.782
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

347
00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:09.618
but in the end.
it got us our biggest victory to date.

348
00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:13.998
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

349
00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:17.168
In my tent is a bag with $50.000...

350
00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:19.253
ten times this if you give me one hour.

351
00:31:27.136 --> 00:31:29.889
Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States.

352
00:31:29.972 --> 00:31:35.435
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

353
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:40.649
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

354
00:31:42.151 --> 00:31:45.779
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

355
00:31:45.863 --> 00:31:49.200
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán.

356
00:31:49.283 --> 00:31:53.537
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

357
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.956
Extradition would become his battle cry.

358
00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:06.092
And for the narcos.
this was a declaration of war.

359
00:35:45.436 --> 00:35:46.812
Connie?

360
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.730
Elisa? What's going on?

361
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.066
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

362
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.152
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

363
00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:54.445
Yeah.

364
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.280
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

365
00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:57.572
About what?

366
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:01.743
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

367
00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:03.870
I don't know what it is.
but I know it's gonna be bad.

368
00:36:03.954 --> 00:36:06.957
Wait. Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

369
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:10.585
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

370
00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:12.129
and you need to hide me.

371
00:36:13.464 --> 00:36:15.048
OK. Come on.

372
00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:21.555
Steve's already at work.
but Javi lives downstairs.

373
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.898
I just hope he's here.

374
00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:33.400
I am.

375
00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:36.945
- Well. what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

376
00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:38.531
I'll be right back. Go.

377
00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:45.204
- She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

378
00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:48.248
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

379
00:36:48.332 --> 00:36:50.667
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

380
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.170
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

381
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:54.421
Escobar and M-19?

382
00:36:54.505 --> 00:36:56.798
She didn't tell me any details.
just that it would be bad.

383
00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:58.800
No... that doesn't make any sense.

384
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:01.678
She asked me to hide her.
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

385
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:02.804
OK. All right.

386
00:37:16.193 --> 00:37:17.194
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

387
00:37:17.403 --> 00:37:20.531
Ambassador. I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

388
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.242
- ...supreme court building.
- Oh. my God.

389
00:37:24.493 --> 00:37:26.245
"Oh. my God" is right.

390
00:37:26.328 --> 00:37:30.790
Financed by Escobar. the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

391
00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:33.377
and occupied the supreme court.

392
00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:36.671
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

393
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:40.426
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

394
00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:42.177
but it was all bullshit.

395
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:44.513
The military attacked.

396
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:46.473
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage.

397
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.018
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

398
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.646
Most of the M-19 were killed.

399
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:56.900
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

400
00:37:58.818 --> 00:38:04.283
setting fire to the room that contained
600.000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

401
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:08.036
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

402
00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:15.628
In the United States.
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

403
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.712
so they can't testify in court.

404
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:23.176
In Colombia. Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

405
00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:29.516
The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

406
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.144
as cannon shells exploded inside.

407
00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:41.487
- Where is she?
- Well. come on in.

408
00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:44.906
You. up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

409
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.283
Put the gun away.

410
00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:48.452
Put it away.

411
00:38:49.662 --> 00:38:51.664
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

412
00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:53.915
- Can I say something?
- No. you may not.

413
00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:57.544
Murphy... calm down.

414
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:01.256
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

415
00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.509
Your wife brought her to me.

416
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:07.929
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife. I truly do.

417
00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:10.056
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

418
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.059
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

419
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.316
If she can tie Escobar to the siege.
I say we bring her in.

420
00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:20.984
Well. she's M-19.

421
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:23.445
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

422
00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:24.779
and then she gets disappeared.

423
00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:27.115
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

424
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:29.326
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

425
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:31.745
Look. all she did was warn us.

426
00:39:31.828 --> 00:39:34.289
She's not on anybody's radar.

427
00:39:34.373 --> 00:39:36.458
She's not involved in anything.

428
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.466
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

429
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.968
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

430
00:39:47.177 --> 00:39:51.097
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

431
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:53.808
Folks. this is more complicated
than what it seems.

432
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:57.396
This was Escobar. classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

433
00:39:58.689 --> 00:40:01.233
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

434
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:04.444
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

435
00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:06.863
He doesn't hold grudges.
not if it suits his purposes.

436
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:10.867
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

437
00:40:11.076 --> 00:40:13.495
You willing to identify this informant.
Agent Peña?

438
00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:17.290
- No. I am not.
- Needless to say...

439
00:40:17.374 --> 00:40:20.960
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

440
00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:23.171
in light of this communist aggression.

441
00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:25.131
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

442
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.176
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.
