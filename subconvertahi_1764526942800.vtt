﻿1
00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:04.990
I'm driving up north.

2
00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:06.091
Gonna plan a funeral.

3
00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:07.458
Sorry to hear that.

4
00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.346
Well. that's 'cause
you never met her.

5
00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:13.714
Every well hit.

6
00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:14.848
Every one.

7
00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:16.401
I need you to answer
when I call.

8
00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:17.635
Last time someone didn't answer
is 'cause

9
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:18.970
they were already gone.

10
00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:20.858
Don't think
we should do this anymore.

11
00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.556
Who paid for this?

12
00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.275
There's a company in Odessa.

13
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:25.610
They financed the whole thing?

14
00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:27.061
Have you ever heard

15
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.480
of a financial services company
out of Odessa

16
00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.864
called Sonrisa?

17
00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.350
Find out everything you can
about 'em.

18
00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.034
The bar is open!

19
00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.987
Who provided

20
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.037
the alcohol?

21
00:00:37.138 --> 00:00:38.739
-Go sit down.
-Make me.

22
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.007
I mean it.

23
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.876
Oh. my God.

24
00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:43.894
Uncuff my fucking wife

25
00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.030
and my fucking daughter

26
00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:46.231
and let 'em go right now.

27
00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:47.798
Hey. turn around!

28
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.966
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey. hey.
-Get on the fucking ground!

29
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.068
Cami Miller. you've been served.

30
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:51.419
There was

31
00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.071
a gas well
off the coast of Louisiana

32
00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:54.472
that blew out.

33
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.773
It means we need
to drill a gas well

34
00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.008
out in the ocean.

35
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:58.726
That's your new partner.

36
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.762
And it's
a real fucking problem. son.

Walt!

51
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.762
Can you keep
this fucking thing straight?

52
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.197
No. I can't keep it straight.

53
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.399
When the road curves.
I have to curve with it.

54
00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:10.134
If you think
this interstate's bumpy.

55
00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:12.937
how about I run us out over that
cow pasture there at about 80?

56
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.239
Well. then slow down

57
00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:15.740
until I get
my fucking makeup done.

58
00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:17.342
If you hadn't rushed me
out of the house...

59
00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:20.160
Sweetheart. I didn't even
ask you to come. remember?

60
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.447
Well. our new house
ain't gonna find itself.

61
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.282
All right?
We're meeting Stephen at noon.

62
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:26.384
No. you're meeting Stephen
at noon. I got business.

63
00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:28.586
That's the reason we're going
up here to start with.

64
00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.004
Grumpy dog. Who pissed
in your Cheerios today?

65
00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.673
Life. that's who.

66
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:36.344
Life pulled out its big dick and
beat me over the head with it.

67
00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:42.267
What are you doing?

68
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.919
You know
car rides make me horny.

69
00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:47.405
-Honey. come on.
-Might as well do it

70
00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:49.857
-before I get my lipstick on.
-Sweetheart...

71
00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.378
I'm trying
to drive a fucking car.

72
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:55.228
We're in traffic here. Ow!

73
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.164
What's with the fucking teeth?

74
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:00.785
Oh. shit.

75
00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.820
We got an audience. babe.
Get up.

76
00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:06.491
Roll down the window.

77
00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:08.293
Hi.

78
00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:10.511
I could write you a citation.

79
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:14.499
It would be worth it. Officer.
but we'll behave. I promise.

80
00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:16.316
Thank you.

81
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:22.407
Now. do you see what kind
of shit you get us in?

82
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.025
Baby.

83
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.629
Yes. ma'am.

84
00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.731
I need you in Fort Worth.

85
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:31.982
I'm at Monty's office.

86
00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.984
His office? Why his office?

87
00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.904
So I can show you
how much money we don't have.

88
00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:41.359
Okay. Well. I got
a business meeting downtown.

89
00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:43.076
I'll come right after that.
okay?

90
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.812
I'll be here.

91
00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.082
Call Rebecca Falcone.

92
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.385
Sure.

93
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.121
Let's call that bitch.

94
00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:11.338
Hey.

95
00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.957
Hey. are you still
in Fort Worth?

96
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.775
I'm in the gym.
I fly out at noon.

97
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.061
Thousand bucks.
she's doing glute thrusts.

98
00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:19.029
-You know I can hear you?
-Am I wrong?

99
00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.949
I bet you can push two plates
a side with that ass.

100
00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.368
Three.

101
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.370
Woo-hoo. You win lawyer
with the strongest...

102
00:06:25.453 --> 00:06:27.204
Shut up. girls. please.

103
00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:29.707
Now. Rebecca. I-I need you
to push your flight back.

104
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.826
You got to meet me at the Fort
Worth office at one o'clock.

105
00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:34.244
How do I push the flight back?

106
00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.596
You just don't show up.

107
00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:37.047
It's our plane.
It ain't going nowhere.

108
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.633
-Okay. I'll see you at one.
-Okay.

109
00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.769
That balloon-lipped
bubble butt...

110
00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.336
You know what? New rule.

111
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:45.823
No talking for at least an hour
after a botched blow job.

112
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.592
My head's so fucked-up now. I
don't even know what I'm doing.

113
00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.142
I'm still on the phone.

114
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.444
Godda...

115
00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:51.929
Now you see what I mean?

116
00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:53.481
It's fucking embarrassing.

117
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:24.077
Well. damn.
this thing's in sorry shape.

118
00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:25.713
She's a mess. boys.

119
00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:27.515
-Lightning strike?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:30.601
Hey. did Tommy say when
the last time anybody was here?

121
00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:32.052
It's been a minute.

122
00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.671
Oh. I see that.
Look at the leaks over there.

123
00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.355
Jerrell. you see that?

124
00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.308
-Son of a bitch is full.
-She full?

125
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.392
Yeah.

126
00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:40.894
This gauge is shot.

127
00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:43.363
These valves are shot. too.

128
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.732
How's a company so broke.

129
00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:46.617
can't afford
to collect what it sells?

130
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.653
When you outsource everything
and don't pay your bills.

131
00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:50.421
there ain't no one
to come collect it.

132
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:51.989
Hey. Jerrell. get up on
that tank. Tell me what you see.

133
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.373
All right.

134
00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:54.775
-King?
-Yeah.

135
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:56.627
Go around and tell me
what that belt look like

136
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.878
on the pump jack.

137
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.932
Big old leak
in the hammer union.

138
00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.924
-Hey. Boss?
-Yeah.

139
00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:12.643
You better take a look
on the other side. man.

140
00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:14.311
-What is it?
-It looks like

141
00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.864
-some kind of tank.
-What. like a holding tank?

142
00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:19.099
An army tank.

143
00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.400
-Army tank?
-Yeah.

144
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.386
What the hell
you talking about. dude?

145
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:23.888
Did Tommy say anything
about the military?

146
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:25.690
-No.
-I'm serious. man.

147
00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:27.424
You ain't hear nothing
about the Army doing nothing

148
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.993
-out here. did you?
-No. sir.

149
00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:30.761
Tommy ain't
mention nothing to me. either.

150
00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.663
Well. these sons of
bitches. You never fucking know.

151
00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:33.764
Right. you right.

152
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.298
To that left over there!

153
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.984
Oh. this right here.

154
00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:47.895
-Oh. fuck.
-What the hell?

155
00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.443
Fuck! Run!

156
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.562
-Run!
-Run. run. run!

157
00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:05.979
-Go. go!
-What?

158
00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:07.280
What is it?

159
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.766
Stay up there. Jerrell!
Don't get down!

160
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.868
Don't come down!
You're above it!

161
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.185
Stay back!

162
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.289
Oh. fuck!

163
00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:17.290
What the fuck?!

164
00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:18.408
Oh. shit. My eyes.

165
00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.610
I got an H2S leak

166
00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:22.362
at Coyote Field. 5272.

167
00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.748
Send Hazmat and EMS.

168
00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:25.215
We got one trapped on the tank.

169
00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.668
Do you have an alarm
or exposure?

170
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:29.419
Both. Call TEXSAR.
Get a helo out here.

171
00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.772
Move it!

172
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:35.008
Jerrell! You hang tight!

173
00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:36.209
Don't fucking move!

174
00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:37.978
Can-can it get to him. Dale?

175
00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.064
H2S is heavy.
you know that. Boss.

176
00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.950
but the fucking gas goes
where the wind goes.

177
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.434
But the wind don't go up. Dale.

353
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:52.505
No. never Thomas.

354
00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:54.974
Fuckhead. cocksucker sometimes.

355
00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.509
piece of shit.

356
00:17:56.643 --> 00:17:57.894
She uses that one a lot.

357
00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:59.346
She sounds Latin.

358
00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:00.764
-German.
-Oh. which is worse.

359
00:18:00.847 --> 00:18:03.850
'cause when they insult you.
they mean it.

360
00:18:03.983 --> 00:18:06.553
-They damn sure do.
-So...

361
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.073
...congratulations are in order.

362
00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:11.824
-Are they?
-Yeah. our wells.

363
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.910
Six producing so far.

364
00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:17.914
Adelante. My petroleum advisers
tell me that's very unusual.

365
00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.633
-You have petroleum advisers?
-I do now. yes.

366
00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:22.419
-Coffee. black.
-Thank you.

367
00:18:22.502 --> 00:18:24.754
We're partners barely a month.
Look how well we're doing.

368
00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:27.091
Oh. no.
you're not partners with me.

369
00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:29.176
You're partners
with a 22-year-old kid

370
00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:32.462
with a net worth of a fucking
30-year-old pickup truck.

371
00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:34.431
Well. he's worth a lot more
than that today.

372
00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:36.183
And that boy's your son. no?

373
00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:37.884
Yeah.

374
00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:39.536
-Well. then my partner is you.
-No.

375
00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.156
We are not fucking partners.
I already told you that.

376
00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:45.057
Do you have any idea
how far up our ass

377
00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:47.811
a probate judge
and the IRS are about to be?

378
00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:50.814
We have over a billion dollars
of revenue a year.

379
00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:52.316
a fucking year.

380
00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:54.084
And you don't think they're
gonna look at everything?

381
00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.052
Oh. good thing for you
that my contract is

382
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.687
with a company
in your son's name.

383
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.656
Correct me if I'm wrong.

384
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:02.442
The industry standard is
that I recoup 100%

385
00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:04.211
before we split the revenue.
right?

386
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:08.715
And typically.
the split is 60-40. not 70-30.

387
00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.835
Plus your son is earning 50%
while I recoup.

388
00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:13.137
There is a generous deal.

389
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.604
and then there's
the deal I made you.

390
00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:16.340
-And why would you do that?
-Well.

391
00:19:16.423 --> 00:19:18.808
let's call it an apology
of sorts.

392
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:22.895
And an investment
in both our futures.

393
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:25.198
Plus it gives your son
real capital

394
00:19:25.298 --> 00:19:26.866
to follow his instincts.

395
00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:29.219
instincts that led him
to an avenue of exploration

396
00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:31.471
that you
and many others ignored.

397
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:32.939
We ignored it for a reason.

398
00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:34.707
Most played-out wells are dry.

399
00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.309
Well. six of 'em aren't.

400
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:38.245
Listen.

401
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.530
I'm not gonna sit here
and discuss the nuance

402
00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:44.451
of oil exploration with
a fucking drug dealer. okay?

403
00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:49.922
Ay. Dios mío.

404
00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:52.792
Yeah. Why would you do that?

405
00:19:52.892 --> 00:19:54.311
Why would you insult me
like that?

406
00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:57.347
-Isn't that what you do?
-Look around. Thomas.

407
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.065
What I do is reinvest income.

408
00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.601
What I do is diversify revenue.

409
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.903
Where that revenue comes from
is irrelevant.

410
00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:06.273
Well. I can think
of about a dozen state

411
00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.192
and federal agencies
that would disagree with that.

412
00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:10.277
Why don't we forget
about what I do

413
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.661
and let me remind you
what I did.

414
00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:13.813
I spared you. Thomas.
I spared you.

415
00:20:13.913 --> 00:20:16.032
And I showed you
a considerable amount of trust

416
00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:17.650
in the process. too.

417
00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:19.569
I bet on your son. which is
something you could have done.

418
00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:21.254
You bet on him to fail.

419
00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:23.490
so he would owe you
and so I'd owe you.

420
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.575
Let me explain something to you.

421
00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:27.477
I don't owe you a fucking thing
and neither does he.

422
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.546
Hey. every time
you take a fucking breath.

423
00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:31.298
-you owe me. Thomas.
-Really?

424
00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.551
Every time you take
a fucking breath. you owe me!

425
00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:36.420
That thing I spared you from.

426
00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:38.305
I can give it back
any time I want.

427
00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.524
Yours is a business
that needs money to grow!

428
00:20:40.607 --> 00:20:42.058
My money is clean!

429
00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:43.976
And the deal is fair
for both of us.

430
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.563
I don't understand how
you're not more proud of him.

431
00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:47.897
Oh. you thought it was luck. no?

432
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.492
But now you know it's not luck.

433
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.000
It's a blind spot
in the industry.

434
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.819
and you're angry
that he found it.

435
00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:54.821
Fuck you.

436
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:01.278
That's what y'all do. isn't it?

437
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:03.613
First hit's always free.

438
00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:05.315
Oh. the first hit's
never free. Thomas.

439
00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:07.834
First hit is an advance.

440
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.866
-You guys taste metal?
-We got to get him

441
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.601
the fuck down
and get the hell out of here.

442
00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:25.818
You call EMS. Dale?

443
00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:26.936
Yeah. Chopper's coming.

444
00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.555
but it's coming from Pecos.

445
00:21:28.688 --> 00:21:31.475
You guys got Hazmat kits
in your truck?

446
00:21:31.558 --> 00:21:32.892
Hey!

447
00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.478
Do you got Hazmat kits
in your truck?

448
00:21:34.561 --> 00:21:35.812
Let's wait for the chopper.
all right?

449
00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:37.314
I ain't waiting for shit.

450
00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:38.948
That wind shifts again.
and we're fucking dead.

451
00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:41.501
-Yeah. I already feel dead.
-In here.

452
00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:43.903
-Oh...
-Shit.

453
00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.538
Hang tight. Jerrell.

454
00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:50.142
I smell it!

455
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.497
-Wind's turning!
-Hey. I smell it.

456
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.632
I fucking smell it!

457
00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:57.133
My alarm. Fuck. Hey. my alarm.

458
00:21:57.216 --> 00:21:58.418
-Boss!
-Hold your breath!

459
00:21:58.551 --> 00:21:59.569
-Do it. Do it.
-I'm coming!

460
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:00.920
Fuck.

461
00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:04.508
Go. hurry up. Dale! Go get him!

462
00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:06.396
I got him.

463
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.234
Fuck!

464
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.570
Here. Hey. hey.

465
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.871
You got to put this on.

466
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:20.824
You got-you got to put this on!

467
00:22:20.907 --> 00:22:23.860
Hurry up. Dale.

468
00:22:23.943 --> 00:22:25.495
There you go. Just breathe...

469
00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:27.279
Oh. shit. Oh. fuck.

470
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.449
Get it out. Get it out. buddy.

471
00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:34.554
Where are you. you fucker?

472
00:22:34.654 --> 00:22:36.756
Fuck!

473
00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:44.330
Hey! Over here!

474
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.302
-Send the harness.
-Not the basket?

475
00:22:50.437 --> 00:22:52.972
No. the harness.
You can't go down there.

476
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.205
Gonna get you out. buddy.

477
00:23:09.288 --> 00:23:11.758
We gonna get you out of here.

478
00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:13.359
We going home.

479
00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:51.448
It's f...

480
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.368
I tore my suit! I tore my suit!

481
00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:58.154
H2S doesn't absorb
through the skin.

482
00:23:58.237 --> 00:23:59.556
-I'm okay?
-Right now you are.

483
00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:00.957
but not for long.

484
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.426
You guys better
get the hell out.

485
00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:03.760
Meet us at Midland General.

486
00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:05.845
Hey. you're with us.

487
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.880
Bring him to the chopper.

488
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.049
Let's go. Bring him with us.

489
00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:45.785
This fucking job. man.

490
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:48.538
I got a fucking family.

491
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:50.256
I don't need this shit!

492
00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:52.291
Boss. eyes on the road.

493
00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:54.143
This is no place
to crash a fucking truck.

494
00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:57.096
-I got a family. man.
-We all got families.

495
00:24:57.196 --> 00:24:59.382
And I'd like to see mine again.
Slow down.

496
00:24:59.465 --> 00:25:00.967
Fucking shit.

497
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.747
-Hey.
-Hey. where are you?

498
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.248
At the lease.
setting drill well seven.

499
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:33.600
No. don't you drill

500
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.867
another fucking thing.

501
00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:36.185
-you hear me?
-Dad. I'm playing

502
00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:37.670
on the house's money now.

503
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.788
No. you're playing
with the devil's money.

504
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.439
You don't know this guy.

505
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.643
So for once in your fucking
life. just please listen to me.

506
00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:45.228
I'm listening.

507
00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:46.613
Not on the phone.

508
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:48.648
We'll talk in person.

509
00:25:48.748 --> 00:25:51.735
We're driving up to Panhandle
tomorrow. Bring a suit.

510
00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:53.119
I don't have a suit.

511
00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:54.553
Well. bring a jacket.

512
00:25:56.623 --> 00:25:59.442
Hey. I got to go. But don't you
drill a fucking thing

513
00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:02.061
till we talk. all right?

514
00:26:02.962 --> 00:26:04.831
All right.

515
00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.534
Hey. baby.

516
00:26:08.668 --> 00:26:10.053
Hi. Daddy. What you doing?

517
00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:11.755
Driving to my next calamity.

518
00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:13.690
How's house hunting?
Did y'all find anything?

519
00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:16.709
She's not house hunting.
She's house looking.

520
00:26:16.843 --> 00:26:18.294
I'm pretty sure she's hunting.

521
00:26:18.377 --> 00:26:21.130
When Mama hunts. she don't
come home empty-handed.

522
00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:23.833
Well. I have all the bullets.
so she's empty-handed this time.

523
00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.434
Are y'all spending the night?

524
00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:27.153
No. babe. we got to come home.

525
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.138
We got your grandma's
funeral tomorrow.

526
00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:30.640
Do I have to go?

527
00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:32.308
I never even met her.

528
00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:34.193
Well. come support your grandpa.

529
00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:35.594
I don't know him. either.

530
00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:37.563
Well. come support me.
How's that?

531
00:26:37.664 --> 00:26:39.031
Is Cooper coming?

532
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.067
-Yeah.
-Dad.

533
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.235
he's so gross.
He smells like hot dogs.

534
00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:45.154
Hon-Honey. please.

535
00:26:45.237 --> 00:26:46.538
I'm so bored.

536
00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.107
Well.

537
00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:50.994
call your mama. She has
absolutely nothing else to do.

538
00:26:51.077 --> 00:26:53.545
Okay. I love you.

539
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.214
Love you. baby.

540
00:26:56.816 --> 00:26:58.217
Good.

541
00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:02.005
Ten more hours left
in this fucking day.

542
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.179
They're in the conference room.

543
00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:12.498
-Okay. Thank you. Monica.
-Yeah.

544
00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.038
Okay. Let me have it.

545
00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:20.439
It's pretty complicated.

546
00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:22.241
Well. give me
the abridged version.

547
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:24.243
Well. the abridged version
is this.

548
00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:27.330
I now know why Monty
was so stressed.

549
00:27:27.413 --> 00:27:30.582
-Well. why was that?
-The company has no money.

550
00:27:30.683 --> 00:27:33.002
Why would it have no money?

551
00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:35.922
M-TEX is broken
into various LLCs...

552
00:27:36.022 --> 00:27:37.456
M-TEX Exploration.

553
00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:40.426
M-TEX Oil Services.
M-TEX Land Trust.

554
00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:41.811
which holds all real estate.

555
00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:44.547
with Gracie and Daisy Miller
as beneficiaries.

556
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.049
and Cami now executor.

557
00:27:46.132 --> 00:27:50.970
But all revenue is paid
into an M. Miller holdco.

558
00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:53.356
theoretically.
with money flowing down

559
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:54.807
to the various LLCs

560
00:27:54.941 --> 00:27:58.227
to cover payroll. leases.
exploration expenses.

561
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.611
Theoretically?

562
00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:03.232
No money flows
from the holdco to the LLCs.

563
00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:07.153
All LLC payables
come from lines of credit

564
00:28:07.253 --> 00:28:08.705
at Goldman. Chase.

565
00:28:08.788 --> 00:28:11.240
AgTrust. Amarillo National.
Pinnacle Bank.

566
00:28:11.323 --> 00:28:12.909
The more we dig.
the more loans we find.

567
00:28:12.992 --> 00:28:14.878
We just can't figure out
how he's paying the loans.

568
00:28:14.961 --> 00:28:16.328
Well. Cami. just call Alan.

569
00:28:16.462 --> 00:28:18.081
-Call Alan and ask him.
-I-I've been calling him.

570
00:28:18.164 --> 00:28:19.816
Most likely. this is a strategy

571
00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:21.367
to limit tax liability.

572
00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:24.103
but the immediate problem is

573
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:27.306
the funds don't exist in any
of the accounts we've found

574
00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.275
to initiate
the offshore drilling.

575
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:32.095
Or any drilling.
for that matter.

576
00:28:32.178 --> 00:28:35.064
And all these lines
of credit are maxed between 80

577
00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.482
and 90%.

578
00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:38.034
There's a large mortgage
on the home

579
00:28:38.117 --> 00:28:39.903
and a second.
a note on the plane.

580
00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:42.772
Our best guess is when Monty
planned a large acquisition

581
00:28:42.855 --> 00:28:45.657
or venture.
he paid down the lines of credit

582
00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:47.894
and used the LLCs to fund.

583
00:28:47.994 --> 00:28:49.996
Okay. so what
are we looking for?

584
00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:51.647
The account that pays the loans.

585
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.632
Okay. fine. I find Alan.

586
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.685
he tells us where
this account is and then

587
00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:57.020
-we clean up the whole mess.
-I don't think

588
00:28:57.103 --> 00:28:58.670
it's gonna be as simple as that.

589
00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:00.289
The holdco is a C Corp.

590
00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:01.958
Monty was the only shareholder.

591
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:03.559
That means
it goes through probate.

592
00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:06.229
When a judge sees this.
he's gonna drop this entire mess

593
00:29:06.312 --> 00:29:08.214
in front of an auditor
at the IRS.

594
00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:10.767
Okay. it's a Friday
in Fort Worth.

595
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.285
Where would a guy
like Alan Thomas happy hour?

596
00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:14.887
Cattlemen's Club.

597
00:29:15.021 --> 00:29:17.306
-Monty have a membership?
-Well. the company does.

598
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:18.942
Okay. let's go.

599
00:29:38.878 --> 00:29:39.796
Ah.

600
00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:41.464
Whoo!

601
00:29:41.547 --> 00:29:43.615
My God. that's sexy.

602
00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:45.501
I wish I could just hug it.

603
00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:47.019
You want to look inside?

604
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.254
Frog's ass watertight?

605
00:29:48.354 --> 00:29:51.190
Come on.
Lead the way. honey.

606
00:29:58.965 --> 00:30:00.199
Is this gonna bother you?

607
00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:02.434
You got to quit that. you know?

608
00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:04.736
You're cheating death
with every puff.

609
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:06.605
But it will catch up. Tommy.

610
00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.641
True enough. but it ain't
gonna catch me today.

611
00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:12.695
I have gone through every email.

612
00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:14.998
every text. every file.

613
00:30:15.081 --> 00:30:17.884
and you just pray
that you don't find something

614
00:30:17.984 --> 00:30:19.952
that makes
the life you've lived a lie.

615
00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:23.222
-Oh. Cami...
-I'm not naive. Tommy.

616
00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:25.341
I know he had secrets.

617
00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:28.677
I half expected
to find a bevy of mistresses.

618
00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.065
but he was a Boy Scout
in that regard. at least.

619
00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:37.103
But this whole world he built...

620
00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:39.022
Hell.

621
00:30:39.105 --> 00:30:42.308
I've always felt
like my life was a fantasy.

622
00:30:42.408 --> 00:30:44.443
and it may just
turn out to be one.

623
00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:46.145
Would it really matter?

624
00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:49.532
There's a trust for the girls
and there's a trust for you.

625
00:30:49.615 --> 00:30:51.517
If everything else went away.

626
00:30:51.617 --> 00:30:53.652
it wouldn't change anything
for you.

627
00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.739
Maybe a smaller house. no jet.

628
00:30:56.822 --> 00:30:59.909
But there's far more
happy people without planes

629
00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:01.710
than there are with 'em.
I promise you that.

630
00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.862
I don't care about the money.

631
00:31:03.963 --> 00:31:07.333
I want Monty remembered
for something good.

632
00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:09.468
not just another wildcatter

633
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:13.139
who got caught without a chair
when the music stopped playing.

634
00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:16.993
I'm gonna have to take this.
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:17.076 --> 00:31:18.494
Otherwise she'll shape-shift
into the truck

636
00:31:18.577 --> 00:31:21.213
and bite a chunk out of me.
Hey. honey.

637
00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:25.101
Ah! Can you see this
fucking bathroom?

638
00:31:25.184 --> 00:31:28.154
And look
at the size of this tub.

639
00:31:28.254 --> 00:31:30.406
I mean. we could swim laps
in that son of a bitch.

640
00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:32.675
That's not all we're gonna do.
you sexy motherfucker.

641
00:31:32.758 --> 00:31:34.994
Hey. hang on a second. honey.
Here. say hi.

642
00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:37.129
Oh. Hi. Cami.

643
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:39.415
Well. hey there. Angela.

644
00:31:39.498 --> 00:31:42.085
-Is that the Dayton's house?
-That's what Stephen said.

645
00:31:42.168 --> 00:31:43.669
You know. there were rumors

646
00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:46.038
his wife was playing a lot
of tennis.

647
00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:48.340
They divorced
over how much tennis she played?

648
00:31:48.474 --> 00:31:50.709
No. they got divorced
over how much she played

649
00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:52.144
with the instructor.

650
00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:53.629
I want to make an offer.

651
00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:55.419
I can't afford
that bathroom. honey.

652
00:31:55.514 --> 00:31:57.600
I can't even afford the towels
in that bathroom.

653
00:31:57.683 --> 00:31:59.302
It'd be good
to have you in Fort Worth.

654
00:31:59.385 --> 00:32:01.353
Well. you remember
our cash flow issue?

655
00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:03.755
-Where are y'all headed?
-Cattlemen's Club.

656
00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:05.374
Ooh! All right.
I'll meet y'all there. okay?

657
00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:06.525
Honey. it's a

658
00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.365
-I love you. Mwah!
-bus... Love you.

659
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.612
But don't come...

660
00:32:09.695 --> 00:32:11.130
Goddamn it.

661
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:15.867
Oh. wow. If you could
sell that exuberance.

662
00:32:15.968 --> 00:32:17.320
Hell. they do sell it.

663
00:32:17.403 --> 00:32:19.488
There's just a worm
at the bottom of the bottle.

664
00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:23.875
Cami. this business...

665
00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:28.497
The goal is to get out.

666
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.217
You build it up
and then you sell it.

667
00:32:31.317 --> 00:32:33.802
Monty should have sold it
years ago.

668
00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.754
And when we get this mess
cleaned up.

669
00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:38.257
it's exactly
what you ought to do.

670
00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:43.346
I mean. you know.
you can build him a museum

671
00:32:43.429 --> 00:32:46.682
or a park or a cancer center
like the Moncriefs.

672
00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:48.934
I mean. you can do something
good with it.

673
00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:53.039
But if you stay in it.
it'll bleed you dry.

674
00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:55.107
You'll lose all of it.

675
00:32:56.142 --> 00:32:57.776
How do you know?

676
00:32:57.909 --> 00:33:01.080
Because it happens
to everybody that stays in it.

677
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.382
Every single one.

678
00:33:27.306 --> 00:33:29.575
Afternoon. Mrs. Miller.

679
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.772
Hey. you might want
to hang here for a minute. okay?

680
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.208
Well. now. why would I do that?

681
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:47.076
Because I'm gonna
get a little rough.

682
00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:49.861
Well. what do you think
I'm gonna do?

683
00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.217
Cami.

684
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.651
Cami. I was just gonna call you.

685
00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:57.002
Oh!

686
00:33:57.103 --> 00:34:00.038
Where's my husband's money?

687
00:34:00.139 --> 00:34:02.007
What do you mean?
It-It's in trusts.

688
00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:04.393
in-in your name
and in your daughters' names.

689
00:34:06.445 --> 00:34:07.863
-Excuse me.
-Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

690
00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:09.681
This'll work itself out
in a minute.

691
00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:11.799
Sir. this kind of behavior
is unacceptable in a restaurant.

692
00:34:11.882 --> 00:34:14.502
It's not a restaurant. It's
a club. Restaurant's upstairs.

693
00:34:14.585 --> 00:34:15.904
so it's fine down here.

694
00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.605
Matter of fact.
that's what clubs are for.

695
00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:19.241
You don't want to be
throwing shit at your attorney

696
00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:22.027
upstairs in a restaurant.
Membership has its privileges.

697
00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:23.962
Can I get an Ultra?

698
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:25.081
We don't carry Ultra.

699
00:34:25.164 --> 00:34:26.532
Well. can you get me

700
00:34:26.632 --> 00:34:28.017
the rich man's version of it?

701
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.068
Longneck. please.

702
00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:31.837
I have been calling you
for days...

703
00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:34.474
-you. your office. your house.
-Cami. Cami...

704
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:37.376
His business has no money.
Alan. none.

705
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.295
There's lines of credit.
but they're maxed out.

706
00:34:39.378 --> 00:34:41.430
I know. I know. And that's...
that's why I didn't call you.

707
00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:43.165
because I-I know.
and I-I'm working on it.

708
00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:44.799
Oh. thank you.

709
00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:47.319
What is that?

710
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:53.492
Shit's pretty good.

711
00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:55.226
Is this settled down?

712
00:34:55.327 --> 00:34:57.280
-What's your name?
-Bonner.

713
00:34:57.363 --> 00:34:58.781
-Bonner?
-Mm-hmm.

714
00:34:58.864 --> 00:35:00.399
That sounds like a beach town.

715
00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:02.951
I can't call you Bonner.
Tell you what.

716
00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:05.454
I'm gonna call you Bob.
I can wrap my head around that.

717
00:35:05.537 --> 00:35:08.174
So. uh. Bob. here's the deal.

718
00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:10.376
Situations like this have
to come to a head

719
00:35:10.476 --> 00:35:11.744
before it resolves itself.

720
00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:13.912
you see? And it's about
to come to a head.

721
00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:15.214
And how do you know?

722
00:35:15.314 --> 00:35:17.216
'Cause I'm about
to take it there.

723
00:35:21.019 --> 00:35:23.289
-Uh-huh. What the... Oh!
-Come here.

724
00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:24.807
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. sir.

725
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.975
-come on. now.
-Where is our goddamn money?!

726
00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:29.428
-Stop it!
-It's-it's okay.

727
00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:32.047
Sir. if this escalates again.
I'm calling the police.

728
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.300
Nobody likes a tattletale. Bob.

729
00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:36.635
Alan.

730
00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.821
Where is our fucking money?

731
00:35:40.172 --> 00:35:43.108
Revenue gets paid
into a holding account.

732
00:35:43.209 --> 00:35:44.743
From there. it funds

733
00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:47.246
an offshore drilling company
out of Nassau.

734
00:35:47.379 --> 00:35:48.947
And-and from there. it goes

735
00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:50.333
into various private equity
funds and gets complicated.

736
00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:51.800
We-we don't...
we don't know anything

737
00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:53.619
about any
offshore drilling company.

738
00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:55.787
Well. it was his company. Tommy.

739
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:57.640
Didn't owe you
a goddamn explanation.

740
00:35:57.723 --> 00:35:59.542
Well. it's her company now.

741
00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:01.177
and you owe her
a goddamn explanation for sure.

742
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.880
I... I just assumed that
we would have a meeting

743
00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:07.599
and discuss business structure
when she was ready.

744
00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:10.052
Alan. we have
a $400 million dollar lawsuit

745
00:36:10.135 --> 00:36:11.887
against us. I think
we're pretty fucking ready.

746
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.522
All right.
First thing Monday. my office.

747
00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:15.974
No. my office. and bring
all your little partners

748
00:36:16.074 --> 00:36:18.757
and little secretaries with
little typewriters and shit.

749
00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.663
the whole shiteree.
I don't give a damn.

750
00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.814
-Fine. Fine.
-All right?

751
00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:27.570
I pay you now. so when I call.

752
00:36:27.653 --> 00:36:29.455
-you answer me.
-I understand.

753
00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:32.074
I don't need you to understand.
I need you to do it.

754
00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:35.427

I told you.
we're not much different.

766
00:37:06.191 --> 00:37:07.776
-That was just business.
-Business.

767
00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:10.962
I understand. It's like
I'm looking into a mirror.

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:22.073
Oh.

772
00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:23.542
Party has arrived.

773
00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:25.027
I see that. baby.

774
00:37:26.512 --> 00:37:28.364
You didn't have any trouble
getting in here?

775
00:37:28.447 --> 00:37:29.748
In this dress?

776
00:37:29.848 --> 00:37:31.967
Oh. sorry.
This is my wife Angela.

777
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.685
-Who's this?
-Danny Morrell.

778
00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:36.038
-Ooh. love the suit. Danny.
-Thank you very much.

779
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:37.323
Love the suit.

780
00:37:37.423 --> 00:37:39.725
-Love the shoes.
-This is getting weird.

781
00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:41.143
Oof. Love the watch.

782
00:37:41.226 --> 00:37:42.311
-Patek?
-Good eye.

783
00:37:42.394 --> 00:37:43.946
Honey. you should
dress like this.

784
00:37:44.029 --> 00:37:45.414
If I dressed like that.
I'd look like

785
00:37:45.497 --> 00:37:47.383
I was selling cotton candy
at the state fair.

786
00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:50.035
Please. have a drink. Stay.

787
00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:52.538
-No. we got to get out of here.
-Love one.

788
00:37:52.638 --> 00:37:54.906
-Honey...
-Oh. there's Cami.

789
00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:57.159
Come over here. girl.
Come on. girl.

790
00:37:57.242 --> 00:38:00.912
-Oh. uh. shit.
-Mwah.

791
00:38:01.046 --> 00:38:02.848
-Hi. Danny Morrell.
-Ooh!

792
00:38:02.948 --> 00:38:04.916
-Cami Miller.
-Ah. Ms. Miller.

793
00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.134
Please. have a seat.

794
00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:08.219
So I guess
we're staying for a drink.

795
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.021
-Evidently.
-A lovely idea.

796
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.840
How about a tequila shot?

797
00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:13.576
Can we get. uh. tequila shots?

798
00:38:13.659 --> 00:38:15.927
-Oh. buonasera.
-Ah.

799
00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:17.896
-Ooh.
-This is my wife. Bella.

800
00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.598
-Hi. Hi.
-This is Tommy.

801
00:38:19.698 --> 00:38:21.116
-Cami Miller.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

802
00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:22.818
-His wife. Angela.
-Hi. Hi.

803
00:38:22.901 --> 00:38:24.019
I love it.

804
00:38:24.102 --> 00:38:25.354
-Oh. wow.
-I love it. I love it.

805
00:38:25.437 --> 00:38:27.272
-Bella.
-Bella.

806
00:38:27.373 --> 00:38:30.659
I almost
named our daughter Bella.

807
00:38:30.742 --> 00:38:32.661
but I didn't want
to have to keep explaining

808
00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:35.080
what it meant.
so then I thought just

809
00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.648
-"Beauty."
-Beautiful.

810
00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:38.950
But old stick-in-the-mud
over here...

811
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.370
Yeah. that's me...
the stodgy voice of reason.

812
00:38:41.453 --> 00:38:43.439
They should have called you
Bella with the skin

813
00:38:43.522 --> 00:38:46.758
-and. ah. hermosa. Hermosa.
-Thank you.

814
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:50.562
Sí.

815
00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.315
Oh. they're speaking
the love language.

816
00:38:52.398 --> 00:38:55.967
Can't fucking take it.

817
00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:59.270
Is this your life. all the time?

818
00:38:59.371 --> 00:39:01.272
One big tragic cartoon.

819
00:39:01.373 --> 00:39:03.392
-I understand why you smoke.
-Yeah.

820
00:39:03.475 --> 00:39:06.562
Everybody says that
when they meet her.

821
00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:13.619
F-R-O-G-S.

822
00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:16.287
TCU!

823
00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:23.261
That was great.

824
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.796
Are my jumps high enough?

825
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.098
-They looked high.
-It felt high.

826
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.968
My coach in Aledo says

827
00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:32.220
it's 'cause
my Achilles is very elliptic.

828
00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.673
Elastic.

829
00:39:34.773 --> 00:39:36.274
-Right.
-Yeah.

830
00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:39.000
You want a margarita?

831
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.564
-I would love one.
-Okay.

832
00:39:41.647 --> 00:39:44.733
No. I'm in training.

833
00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:46.234
Keep drinking your margarita.

834
00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:47.703
I'll join you soon.

835
00:39:47.786 --> 00:39:51.490
Keep doing your flips.

836
00:39:53.692 --> 00:39:56.895
I can feel myself
getting dumber.

837
00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:58.697
Nate. is. uh. is Tommy back?

838
00:39:58.797 --> 00:40:00.832
In the morning. I think.

839
00:40:05.003 --> 00:40:06.838
Goddamn it.

840
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.625
I'll tell you what. Nate.

841
00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:12.210
I have cheated death...

842
00:40:13.545 --> 00:40:15.514
...in this place.

843
00:40:16.314 --> 00:40:17.600
More than once.

844
00:40:17.683 --> 00:40:20.085
But. uh...

845
00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:26.157
...nothing like today.

846
00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:28.660
They're both stable?

847
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.862
Yeah. uh...

848
00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:33.164
they sent BR home.

849
00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:37.035
And. uh. they're keeping
Jerrell overnight.

850
00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:39.705
Tommy wants
to take over that lease.

851
00:40:39.805 --> 00:40:43.074
Well. we got to take
all the wells offline.

852
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.128
And. uh...

853
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:48.079
environmental cleanup'll take.

854
00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:51.634
oh... 20 million. two years.

855
00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:53.084
It worth it?

856
00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.437
Oh. hell yeah. it's worth it.

857
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.839
Oil's pooled on the ground

858
00:40:56.922 --> 00:40:59.925
like a fucking tar pit.

859
00:41:00.058 --> 00:41:02.528
I'd. uh. increase the coverage

860
00:41:02.628 --> 00:41:04.896
of our wrongful death policy.
though.

861
00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:09.334
Lovely business. ain't it?

862
00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:15.023
Is there a TV on outside?

863
00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:18.376
That is our house guest.

864
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.445
cheering for a brighter future.

865
00:41:20.546 --> 00:41:23.532
Mm. Well. best of luck
with that.

866
00:41:23.615 --> 00:41:25.584
Fucking kids.

867
00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:36.512
I'll see you
in the morning. counselor.

868
00:41:36.595 --> 00:41:38.329
Night.

869
00:41:42.067 --> 00:41:43.351
So.

870
00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:47.055
Obama had loosened
the restrictions with Cuba.

871
00:41:47.138 --> 00:41:50.559
so I could finally see his home.
And I planned this whole trip

872
00:41:50.642 --> 00:41:52.761
-to Havana as a surprise.
-You can smoke in here?

873
00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:54.112
And so I...

874
00:41:54.212 --> 00:41:55.798
You can do whatever you want.
my friend.

875
00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:57.866
-That's good to know.
-And away we go.

876
00:41:57.949 --> 00:41:59.401
-Mm.
-But before we take off.

877
00:41:59.484 --> 00:42:02.320
the pilot goes to Danny and asks
if you prefer to go

878
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.623
to Cancún and take the boat in

879
00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:06.642
so we don't get a Cuban stamp
in our passport.

880
00:42:06.725 --> 00:42:08.711
-Mm-hmm.
-And oh. mad on a.

881
00:42:08.794 --> 00:42:10.662
his face goes wild.

882
00:42:10.796 --> 00:42:13.215
He looks at me and says.
"Where are you taking me?"

883
00:42:13.298 --> 00:42:15.651
And I'm like. "Baby. I'm taking
you home." And he goes...

884
00:42:15.734 --> 00:42:18.136
He tells me everything
about...

885
00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:20.989
His family is a great enemy of
Castro. and they will kill him.

886
00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:22.708
And-and-and...

887
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.680
He says to me. "I-I can't
go home until Cuba is free."

888
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.365
This part always makes me cry.
I...

889
00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:31.950
-It's making me cry.
-I know.

890
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.435
I need a fucking martini.

891
00:42:33.518 --> 00:42:35.687
Yeah.

892
00:42:35.787 --> 00:42:37.823
How come you never take me home?

893
00:42:37.923 --> 00:42:41.026
To fucking Big Spring?
And do what. tour the prison?

894
00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:45.496
Somewhere. It could
have been my home. but nice.

895
00:42:45.631 --> 00:42:47.583
Think about what you just said
for a minute.

896
00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.636
Ah.

897
00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:54.673
So. Danny tells the pilot.
"Take me to her home."

898
00:42:54.806 --> 00:42:57.259
-Where's your home?
-It's in Portofino. in Italia.

899
00:42:57.342 --> 00:42:58.727
It's a little fishing village.

900
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.264
So across the ocean we go...
and

901
00:43:02.347 --> 00:43:03.766
-we had to hop our way there.
-Mm-hmm.

902
00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:05.267
We went to New York first.
then London.

903
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.434
-and then Roma.
-Rome.

904
00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.019
Finally Italia.

905
00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:10.722
And there. all the houses are.
ah. a different color.

906
00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:12.307
They're pink. and-and turquoise.

907
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.325
-and yellow and...
-Mm.

908
00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:15.861
Danny looked at them.

909
00:43:15.961 --> 00:43:17.479
and then he looked at me
and said.

910
00:43:17.562 --> 00:43:21.867
"Do you want to know my home?
This is almost it."

911
00:43:23.268 --> 00:43:25.287
Mmm.

912
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.907
Oh. I've been there.

913
00:43:29.007 --> 00:43:31.159
With my husband and my girls.

914
00:43:32.644 --> 00:43:34.880
It's beautiful.

915
00:43:38.817 --> 00:43:41.086
Y'all need to cherish this.

916
00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:44.622
I mean.
do you know how rare it is

917
00:43:44.723 --> 00:43:47.025
to love someone long enough

918
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:49.427
-to actually know them?
-Mm.

919
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.762
Most people.

920
00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:52.314
once they get
to know their partner.

921
00:43:52.397 --> 00:43:54.065
they fall out of love.

922
00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:57.736
But a rare few fall deeper.

923
00:43:57.836 --> 00:44:01.690
A very rare few.

924
00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:06.144
How strange to be sitting
at a table full of 'em.

925
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.082
Where is yours?

926
00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.335
Waiting for me. I hope.

927
00:44:13.418 --> 00:44:16.021
if there's someplace to wait.

928
00:44:16.855 --> 00:44:18.323
When did he die?

929
00:44:19.725 --> 00:44:23.261
Seven weeks. three days
and. um...

930
00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:28.834
...11 hours ago.

931
00:44:28.934 --> 00:44:32.003
Very few love enough
to keep track.

932
00:44:32.871 --> 00:44:34.505
That's my point.

933
00:44:35.907 --> 00:44:37.675
I'm sure he's a very good man.

934
00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:41.897
I'm not so sure about that.

935
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.114
But

936
00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:46.184
he was very good to me.

937
00:44:47.953 --> 00:44:49.454
And a loving father.

938
00:44:49.587 --> 00:44:52.490
-What else is there?
-There's plenty.

939
00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:55.794
But the plenty
don't matter to me.

940
00:44:58.163 --> 00:45:01.717
Tommy. you are surrounded
by fierce women.

941
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.269
and maybe that's why
you're so fierce.

942
00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:06.304
They make you fierce.

943
00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.891
I'm not fierce.

944
00:45:08.974 --> 00:45:10.308
I'm very protective.

945
00:45:10.408 --> 00:45:12.710
Well. that's what
"fierce" means.

946
00:45:17.482 --> 00:45:20.218
How late
does this place stay open?

947
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:23.421
Until I tell it to close.

948
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:33.031
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh. thank you.

949
00:45:33.131 --> 00:45:34.582
Thank you.

950
00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.318
I'm learning the scope
of your thing

951
00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:37.920
as you learn the scope of mine.

952
00:45:38.003 --> 00:45:40.171
It's where we're at.

953
00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:42.124
The problem you had
in the corner there...

954
00:45:42.207 --> 00:45:43.474
I can help you with that.

955
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.510
Portofino is amazing.

956
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:46.762
Thank you for the drinks.

957
00:45:46.845 --> 00:45:49.047
Hey. hon. let's go.

958
00:45:50.849 --> 00:45:52.217
I fucking love you.

959
00:45:52.317 --> 00:45:53.769
-Oh. my God. mi her man a.
-Love you.

960
00:45:53.852 --> 00:45:54.937
Órale. órale. órale.

961
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.822
Thomas.

962
00:45:56.922 --> 00:45:58.489
-Mwah.
-Mwah.

963
00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:01.643
You think that
some toked-out gangbanger

964
00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:03.846
is gonna sign surface leases
without permission?

965
00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:06.297
You think we're not already
in business together?

966
00:46:07.432 --> 00:46:09.117
And you think my business
is what they do?

967
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.669
I don't sell anything.
I invest. you understand?

968
00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.171
I'm just an investor.

969
00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:15.824
And I told you.
we're gonna good friends.

970
00:46:15.907 --> 00:46:17.159
Friendship is earned.

971
00:46:17.242 --> 00:46:19.828
Yeah. so serious.

972
00:46:19.911 --> 00:46:22.580
Have to say.
I do like your wife. though.

973
00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:25.416
What do you mean.
"I like your wife"?

974
00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:28.053
Honey. we're leaving.
We can fight in the car.

975
00:46:28.186 --> 00:46:29.838
Damn right
we'll fight in the car.

976
00:46:29.921 --> 00:46:33.058
Ah. Mrs. Miller.
Such a pleasure.

977
00:46:33.158 --> 00:46:34.926
-Thank you. Pleasure was mine.
-Mm.

978
00:46:35.026 --> 00:46:36.394
You know what I do?

979
00:46:36.494 --> 00:46:39.064
-I don't.
-I'm an investor.

980
00:46:39.164 --> 00:46:40.348
In oil?

981
00:46:40.431 --> 00:46:42.284
In people.
In people that I believe in.

982
00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:44.569
and you're a person
to believe in.

983
00:46:46.237 --> 00:46:48.073
Well. I may need an investor.

984
00:46:48.907 --> 00:46:50.408
I'm very easy to find.

985
00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:52.828
Thank you again for the drinks.

986
00:46:52.911 --> 00:46:54.763
-My pleasure.
-And thank you for the stories.

987
00:46:54.846 --> 00:46:56.647
Oh. of course.

988
00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.200
-Good night.
-Good night.

989
00:46:58.283 --> 00:47:00.485
Good night.

990
00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.390
"I sure like your wife."

991
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.175
-Honey. come on.
-What the fuck is that?

992
00:47:07.258 --> 00:47:08.844
Honey. please don't start
this shit. all right?

993
00:47:08.927 --> 00:47:12.964
Want to do a little sampling
off the Italian buffet?

994
00:47:13.064 --> 00:47:14.765
Huh?
You want to get your salsa on?

995
00:47:14.866 --> 00:47:16.018
You are so fucking lucky...

996
00:47:16.101 --> 00:47:17.768
-I'm so fucking lucky. what?
-Yeah.

997
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.722
Oh. you want
to give me the old backhand?

998
00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:22.107
Huh?

999
00:47:22.207 --> 00:47:24.309
Pull this truck over
if you want to fight.

1000
00:47:24.409 --> 00:47:26.577
You think life has a big dick.

1001
00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:28.196
Wait until I hit you with mine.

1002
00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:30.548
What the hell does that mean?

1003
00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:41.559
Now that scares
the shit out of me.

1004
00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.663
You called me your wife.

1005
00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:48.033
Well. you are my wife.

1006
00:47:48.133 --> 00:47:51.469
-That was ten years ago.
-I mean. we've been...

1007
00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:54.122
kind of living as husband
and wife. so I just figured.

1008
00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:57.259
you know. uh.
that's what I call you.

1009
00:47:57.342 --> 00:47:59.644
Shit. I don't know
what else to call you.

1010
00:48:00.778 --> 00:48:02.347
Are you asking?

1011
00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:04.082
Am I what?

1012
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.118
Yes.

1013
00:48:07.919 --> 00:48:10.605
-Yes?
-Fuck yes. Yes!

1014
00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:12.757
What are you doing?
Goddamn it. honey.

1015
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.511
No. No. no. no. no. sweetie.
come on.

1016
00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:19.530
-Think about the kids.
-Ah. Mm...

1017
00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.786
Honey? Hon...
Get back over there.

1018
00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:27.672
Goddamn.

1019
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:39.717
I'm gonna finish
what I started this morning.

1020
00:48:43.955 --> 00:48:47.358
Sweetheart. I would like
to see my kids alive.

1021
00:48:48.293 --> 00:48:50.145
I don't want 'em looking at me
in the ground. please.

1022
00:48:50.228 --> 00:48:52.397
Mm-hmm.

1023
00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:56.167
Sweetheart. come on now.

1024
00:48:58.203 --> 00:48:59.487
Ow! Goddamn. honey.

1025
00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.539

not a snow cone.
