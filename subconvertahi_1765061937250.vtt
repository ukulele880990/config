<i>Previously on</i> The Mighty Nein...

2
00:00:02.712 --> 00:00:05.131
Have-have you heard of
the Soltryce Academy?

3
00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.007
It is an excellent school.

4
00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:08.843
<i>The teachers are another story.</i>

5
00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:11.762
You ever been to a Cobalt Soul Library?

6
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.681
<i>Nein.</i>

7
00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.143
Hello. old friend.

8
00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.936
How did you lose your magic?

9
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.938
Someone took it from me.

10
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.898
Did you kill them?

11
00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:24.525
Not yet.

12
00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:29.029
<i>Volstruckers...
all we know is they're trained</i>

13
00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:30.698
<i>by someone in the Cerberus Assembly.</i>

14
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.491
I seek one of your prisoners.

15
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:33.660
<i>Nein.</i> not the necklace.

16
00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:35.077
I-I need it.

17
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.163
We are all in great danger.

18
00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:38.789
She found me.

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.074
Do you want subtitles for any video?
-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-

20
00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:51.510
<i>Let me tell you a story.</i>

21
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:11.363
Bren! Breakfast!

22
00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:14.408
Good morning. Mother.

23
00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.078
Where is Father?

24
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.749
Boars ruined the fence again.

25
00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.418
I will go and fetch him.

26
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.338
Before your delicious porridge gets cold.

27
00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.424
Oh. come on!

28
00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:31.884
Thank you. little spark.

29
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:42.353
Left. left!

30
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.151
Here. let me help.

31
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.698
No offense. kid. but I don't think
you can do any better.

32
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.285
Son? You have something up your sleeve?

33
00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:01.997
Pockets. actually.

34
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.670
Now keep it steady.

35
00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.259
<i>Amenth-Spaodas.</i>

36
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:21.559
Well done. boy.

37
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.018
Sorcery!

38
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:27.273
No... well. yes. Sort of.

39
00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:33.320
Your father said you could do magic...
but I figured he meant card tricks...

40
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:36.073
A common misunderstanding.

41
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:38.242
Magic is nothing more than a tool.

42
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.494
Like a hoe or a hammer.

43
00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:46.709
Amazing what this one can do with
talent and some old books.

44
00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.004
Ho.

45
00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.591
Wow. that's a fancy ride.

46
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.343
What is the Empire doing way out here?

47
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.727
Hail King Dwendal.

48
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.484
I presume this is your work?

49
00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:14.278
Pardon me. is there some

50
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.362
kind of problem?

51
00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:16.906
How rude of me.

52
00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.159
Trent Ikithon.
I am a Professor at the Sol...

53
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.410
The Soltryce Academy.

54
00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.245
Shake his hand.

55
00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.331
Apologies. my lord.

56
00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:27.917
We don't often
get visitors of your standing.

57
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.502
Oh. I am no lord.

58
00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:33.589
Merely a practitioner of the arcane arts.

59
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:38.010
I heard there was
a farmer's son in the Zemni Fields

60
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.387
who had a gift for magic.

61
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:45.809
This transmutation spell... it shows a
high level of refinement.

62
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.937
He's not in trouble then?

63
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:53.734
No. no. Quite the opposite.

64
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.494
It's been quite a while since I've had a
home-cooked meal.

65
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:04.578
Ah.

66
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.622
Your doing. I presume?

67
00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:08.916
It was an accident.

68
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.668
Arcane Fire.

69
00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:14.964
Sadly. your brick never stood a chance.

70
00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.592
Arcane Fire burns hotter
than natural flames.

71
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:22.972
To summon such a spell
with no instruction...

72
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.974
that's exemplary. Bren.

73
00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:27.267
It was just in a book. sir.

74
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.270
Anyone can read the words.

75
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:31.647
But to understand it...

76
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.110
I believe you would thrive
at the Soltryce Academy.

77
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.946
I appreciate that. sir.

78
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.156
But my hands are needed here.

79
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.660
We've discussed it.

80
00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.453
The tuition is...

81
00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.706
We could take some livestock to market.

82
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.664
Darling.

83
00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.669
We'd never want to hold Bren back
from serving the Empire.

84
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.379
I see.

85
00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:59.883
I'm certain Bren's talent will
secure him a scholarship.

86
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.180
And if he graduates. he'll earn more than
enough to hire help for the farm.

87
00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:09.268
Ow! You stupid...

88
00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:11.437
Frumpkin! No!

89
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.606
I am sorry. sir.
He's never done that before.

90
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.900
It's quite alright.

91
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.114
See?

92
00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.407
All better.

93
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:32.916
In my hand is an acceptance
letter to the Academy.

94
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.335
The parchment is enchanted

95
00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.049
so that when it burns. the letter
will appear in the Admissions Office.

96
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:43.218
Consider this your entrance exam.

97
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:46.638
Bren means 'fire' in the old tongue. yes?

98
00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:50.476
Let's see if you can live up to the name.

99
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.113
<i>Voos-caulda.</i>

100
00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.667
You can do this. lad.

101
00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:23.425
<i>Voos...</i>

102
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.136
<i>...caulda!</i>

103
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.189
Bren Aldric Ermendrud.

104
00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:39.775
Welcome to the Soltryce Academy.

105
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:42.736
And to the rest of your life.

106
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.739
-My boy!
-Bren. how wonderful.

107
00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.297
Oh. Hello.

108
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:05.509
Hello yourself. I'm Astrid.

109
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.386
The love you is Eadwulf.

110
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.012
Come on in.

111
00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:17.855
So... what's your name?

112
00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:22.401
Bren.

113
00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:29.449
You're a long way from home.

114
00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:22.127
Who the hell is she?

115
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.049
{\an8}Why do people keep trying to kill us

116
00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.884
{\an8}in this goddamn town?

117
00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:36.850
This is not a fight we can win.
We need to run.

118
00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:39.603
No chance. This fucker's
been following me for weeks.

119
00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.481
If we're gonna do this. we need a plan.

120
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.441
Molly. you and I...

121
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.695
Oh. my Traveler! Fjord!

122
00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:49.988
You want a fight.

123
00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:52.074
I'm happy to oblige.

124
00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:58.705
<i>Lebash Nivek!</i>

125
00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:04.962
Wow. that is actually really cool.

126
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.213
As I was saying...

127
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.540
Get sailor boy on his feet.
We'll buy you time.

128
00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.523
The poison's
not reacting to my magic.

129
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.985
Is it bad?

130
00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.486
Bad is so negative.

131
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.322
How about we just say
"impressively gruesome"?

132
00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.406
Could you pick a word and get on with it?

133
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:37.953
Come on. Fjord.

134
00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:48.797
Caleb!

135
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.467
My guardian goblin.

136
00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:02.602
This bitch.

137
00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:19.328
Yah!

138
00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:34.343
Sorry. I don't do magic.

139
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.057
Payback's a bitch. ain't it?

140
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:43.518
A-Are the bugs gone?

141
00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.396
Wow. [laughs] We won.

142
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.024
Hooray.

143
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.902
Normally. I love drawing a crowd.

144
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.862
but perhaps we should
get the fuck out of town.

145
00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.489
What about Goth girl?

146
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.866
I've got more than
a few questions for her.

147
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.535
More Townsguard will be here any minute.

148
00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:00.535
Oh.

149
00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:03.455
Caleb and I saw an abandoned
farmhouse on the way here.

150
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.874
Fine. Load up.

151
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.632
The fuck. man? We need her alive.

152
00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.886
My amulet.

153
00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.471
Give it to me.

154
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.812
Now you can no longer hide.

155
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.250
You've got big balls showing up late.

156
00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.294
More like his chicken legs were too slow.

157
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:52.671
Library?

158
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:53.922
Lost track of time.

159
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.215
Let us begin.

160
00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.844
Combat magic can be
entirely unpredictable.

161
00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.597
In battle. you may find yourself
distracted. confounded.

162
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.518
But. above all else.
you must protect yourself.

163
00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:07.644
Line up. please.

164
00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:10.689
Now. your task is a simple one.

165
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.233
Come. join me here.

166
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.153
The first three students who do. pass.

167
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.988
The rest fail.

168
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:32.711
Come.

169
00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.005
Surely one of you can reach me.

170
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.311
Ah. Unlucky.

171
00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.229
What the hell?

172
00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.523
Traps. He is testing us.

173
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.277
You see that route?

174
00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:01.990
<i>Ja.</i> Use the others.

175
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.617
All right.

176
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.993
Race you. chicken legs.

177
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.133
Nice.

178
00:13:24.638 --> 00:13:27.224
Whoo! That's how you do it.

179
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.568
Owelia?

180
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.070
<i>Doff-keen-brada.</i>

181
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.373
Well done.

182
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.958
Thank you. Master.

183
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.668
Bren figured it out.

184
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.087
Distract. confound. protect yourself.

185
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.756
You gave us the solution
right at the start.

186
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.342
These students have

187
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.971
displayed a wisdom
I have been trying to impart all semester.

188
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.182
In the service of our Empire.
you will be faced

189
00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:11.893
with choices that seem questionable.

190
00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:14.604
But as you saw today. you must do

191
00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.940
whatever it takes to succeed.

192
00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.318
Class dismissed.

193
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.864
A moment.

194
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:27.742
I have a special task for you three.

195
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.508
Should we at least wrap her wounds?

196
00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:44.718
<i>-Nein.</i>
-No.

197
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.179
Are you okay?
Maybe we should find you a doctor.

198
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.642
I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

199
00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:08.366
Was. uh. was that everything you needed?

200
00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:11.453
You did very well. <i>ja.</i>

201
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:15.332
And what does it mean
that she broke your amulet?

202
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.750
Yeah. Caleb.

203
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.251
What does it mean?

204
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.838
That we are not safe. Any of us.

205
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:26.843
I also find it quite interesting that
this woman has been tracking you. <i>ja?</i>

206
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.221
Not that it's your business.

207
00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.933
but I think she's tangled up
in an explosion at the border.

208
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:35.935
The Kryn and Empire are
always trying to kill each other.

209
00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:37.979
Not like this.

210
00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:39.898
Monk's right.

211
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.567
Last couple towns we played.
folks were on edge.

212
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.069
Don't you feel it?

213
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.237
War's brewing.

214
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.198
You can feel that?

215
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.700
I can feel when my purse is empty.

216
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.286
and we haven't had
a sold-out show in months.

217
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.539
Not till the one you fucked up.
thank you very much.

218
00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.333
That tent exploding was cool. though.

219
00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.334
Point is.

220
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.003
with war comes assassins. spies.

221
00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:04.631
Secret Empire agents. like this bitch.

222
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.549
You are correct.

223
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.635
She is too dangerous to let live.

224
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.638
Are you suggesting we execute her?

225
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.683
Or maybe we'll talk to her
and she'll see how cool we are

226
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.226
and become our bestie. you don't know.

227
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.686
Well.

228
00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.063
ladies and gents. misfits and malcontents.

229
00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.773
our traveling troupe has reached

230
00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.483
its destination.

231
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.610
You could've
just said. "We're here."

232
00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:33.284
Let's get
little miss cockroach in a chair.

233
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:36.038
Oh. can I come? I've always
wanted to see fingernails pulled.

234
00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:37.622
I go where Caleb goes.

235
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.166
This isn't a damn social club.

236
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.626
She's right.

237
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.754
But I should at least be there
in case you need backup with...

238
00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:45.964
Whoa. there.

239
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.174
You're looking much greener than usual.

240
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:51.094
Come on. Fjord.
let's find you a bed. No arguing.

241
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.150
Um. Caleb.

242
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.110
you sure you're all right?

243
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.945
You seem tense.

244
00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.280
More than usual.

245
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.574
Go help Jester.

246
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.826
You have a gift for toxins and the like.

247
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.035
You can help.

248
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.662
Okay.

249
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.161
Use your reed if you need me.

250
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm watching you. undercut.

251
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.210
<i>Danke.</i>

252
00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.295
Go.

253
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.810
So. what is our plan?

254
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.356
She is a wizard like me.

255
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.276
Perhaps I can assist
with the interrogation.

256
00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.069
Fine. Look.

257
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:51.863
maybe we try the old
"good monk. bad monk."

258
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.657
I'm bad monk. Obviously.

259
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.412
Oh. Molly. he's burning up.

260
00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.499
I can heal cuts and bruises.
but not poison.

261
00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:07.045
Traveler. please.
I don't want Fjord to D-I-E.

262
00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.798
Get out of the way.

263
00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.966
Okay. Let's see here.

264
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.262
The poison may be magic. but...

265
00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.140
...it resembles adder venom.

266
00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.643
You can make a home remedy
with Basilisk Tongue.

267
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.812
Okay. Where do we find a basilisk?

268
00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.731
And I call dibs on cutting out its tongue.

269
00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.190
It's a plant.

270
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.983
That is disappointing.

271
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.486
Look. i-it must grow nearby.

272
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.697
These little yellow flowers
have antiseptic properties.

273
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:38.243
We need enough to brew a tea
or the corruption will spread and he'll...

274
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.911
uh. D-I-E?

275
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:43.164
You guys know I can spell. right?

276
00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.624
I didn't. actually.

277
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:47.794
Do we really trust the goblin?

278
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.963
Hey. he's got a point.

279
00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.840
No. Nott wouldn't lie.

280
00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.051
We will go find the Basilisk Tongue thing.

281
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.220
Fjord. hang on.

282
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.763
You better listen to her.

283
00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.974
I'm pretty sure she'd kill you if you die.

284
00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.394
Sorry about that. I...

285
00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.563
I didn't mean...

286
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.734
I don't know what she sees in you.

287
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.572
Whisper the first syllable
of a spell.

288
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.656
and I crush your larynx.

289
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.492
Then my friend here lights your ass up.

290
00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.122
Do the. do the fire fingers thing.

291
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.665
I thought I was "good monk."

292
00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.713
You and your Volstrucker buddies
stole something from the Kryn.

293
00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.924
And it sure as fuck
wrecked Rockguard Garrison.

294
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.717
so what was it?

295
00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.850
Okay.

296
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.977
I know you have snitches
in the Cobalt Soul.

297
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.897
Give me names
and maybe we'll leave you in one piece.

298
00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.237
What you did is starting a war.

299
00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.032
and thousands of innocent people
are gonna pay the price.

300
00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.326
Now talk.

301
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.288
Three days.

302
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.165
Three days till what?

303
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.500
Leave the prisoner in isolation

304
00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.586
for three days before questioning.

305
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:15.089
To imagine the torture they will receive.

306
00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.676
To break them without lifting a finger.

307
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:22.305
You are an amateur.

308
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.349
And it shows.

309
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:27.018
<i>Enflotho hashet.</i>

310
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.449
You will answer her questions

311
00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:45.286
or you will regret what comes next.

312
00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:55.463
Think this is another test?

313
00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:58.424
Mm. Everything is a test with him.

314
00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.009
Guys. relax.

315
00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.136
I bet we're gonna get promoted.

316
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.513
You think?

317
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.722
Look at us.

318
00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.933
Master Ikithon's not an idiot.

319
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.110
You first. little spark.

320
00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:35.253
'Tis only a chair.

321
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:42.010
Do you know why I plucked you
out of the Zemni Fields. Bren?

322
00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.971
Because you. my boy. are special.

323
00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:50.977
Even at your age. I believe you are ready
to apply your education to the field.

324
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:56.566
You mean join the Cerberus Assembly?

325
00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:59.027
Uh. not quite.

326
00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:02.030
As of tonight.

327
00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:04.490
you will join an elite group.

328
00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:08.369
A secret force trained
in incredible magic.

329
00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:12.665
who exists only to serve the Empire.

330
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:15.168
Just as you've always wanted. yes?

331
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.753
Of course. Master.

332
00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:20.214
What of Astrid and Eadwulf?

333
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:23.342
Oh. they will be given
the same opportunity.

334
00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:25.928
But make no mistake.

335
00:22:26.012 --> 00:22:29.640
you are the rising star. Bren.

336
00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:34.771
The little spark who became a firestorm.

337
00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:37.440
<i>Shratten thoo.</i>

338
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.169
Accept the pain.

339
00:22:58.252 --> 00:23:00.046
Endure it.

340
00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:02.006
A sign of your dedication.

341
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.299
You can do this.

342
00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.890
Your father needs you to be strong.

343
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:23.277
What did your Master steal from the Kryn?

344
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.077
Okay. I think she gets it.

345
00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:34.413
You should not have stopped me.

346
00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:37.917
These people only tell the truth
when their body has no other choice.

347
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.461
You certainly know
a lot about "these people."

348
00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:42.130
Yes. he does.

349
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:48.845
You know how easy it
would be for us to kill her. together.

350
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:50.555
What did she just say?

351
00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:52.890
Nothing important.

352
00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:56.644
So it's just a fucking coincidence
this chick speaks Zemnian. too?

353
00:23:56.727 --> 00:23:58.896
Or is there something more to it?

354
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.481
This is her plan.

355
00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:04.026
To sow doubt between us then escape
when we are focused on each other.

356
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.321
That's funny. You didn't say I was wrong.

357
00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:14.829
Fjord won't die. will he?

358
00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:17.623
Don't even answer that. He can't die.

359
00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:20.487
The Traveler would never let that happen.
Right. Traveler?

360
00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.171
"Right. Jester."

361
00:24:23.254 --> 00:24:26.424
You know. y-you...
whenever you want to say hi.

362
00:24:26.507 --> 00:24:29.010
I'm just freaking out here.
trying to save a life.

363
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:31.220
That's the trouble with gods. isn't it?

364
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:33.889
You never know if they'll be there
when you need them.

365
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:35.975
Oh. the Traveler is always there.

366
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.769
He's just not always here.

367
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:39.979
Hmm.

368
00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:42.023
You know who is always here.

369
00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:44.734
at least. in the scant few days
I've known you?

370
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.196
You are so right.

371
00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.325
The Traveler must have sent Fjord
so I could have a friend when he's busy.

372
00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:54.535
Huh.

373
00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:57.330
Who knows the whims of the gods?

374
00:24:57.413 --> 00:24:59.248
Well. this doesn't seem like enough.

375
00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:01.459
Can you use your special vision
to find more.

376
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.586
like with that ugly ghost frog?

377
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:06.589
Or do you need blood?

378
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.550
Want to know a secret?

379
00:25:10.927 --> 00:25:13.012
That's never happened before.

380
00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:15.306
So mysterious.

381
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:20.061
I mean. you can smell blood.
and your blood turns into ice?

382
00:25:20.144 --> 00:25:21.270
Ho.

383
00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:24.315
What happens if you drink blood?

384
00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:26.567
You know. I'm not too keen to find out.

385
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:28.319
Those answers lay in the past.

386
00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:30.279
and I find the past dreadfully boring.

387
00:25:30.363 --> 00:25:32.823
Oh. yeah. is that why you carry
those fancy cards?

388
00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:35.117
To peer into your future?

389
00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:37.745
Not quite. lass.

390
00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:39.664
Take this group. for instance.

391
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.625
We've got a homeless wizard.
an inebriated goblin.

392
00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.168
a half-orc midshipman...

393
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:46.087
-Captain.
-Right.

394
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.964
...who doesn't understand his power

395
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:50.967
and a temperamental monk
in way over her head.

396
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.595
I don't need the cards
to tell me that adventure lays before us.

397
00:25:53.678 --> 00:25:55.972
You people are damned interesting.

398
00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:57.848
I know. right?

399
00:25:57.932 --> 00:26:01.602
And the most intriguing of all
is this wide-eyed talented woman

400
00:26:01.686 --> 00:26:05.815
who'd do best to leave a one-sided
relationship with an invisible god.

401
00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:07.858
Yeah.

402
00:26:07.942 --> 00:26:10.736
Wait. are you talking about me?

403
00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:20.955
Get off of me.

404
00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:23.040
Ugh. stop.

405
00:26:23.124 --> 00:26:26.419
Oh. what. you think I want
to touch your sweat-ass body?

406
00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:29.463
What are you doing?

407
00:26:29.547 --> 00:26:32.925
I'm trying to keep you cool
so the fever doesn't cook your brain.

408
00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:36.804
You're a wizard's sidekick.

409
00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:40.391
What do you know about poison?

410
00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:42.184
I knew an alchemist once.

411
00:26:42.268 --> 00:26:44.020
He taught me a few things.

412
00:26:44.103 --> 00:26:45.938
And I helped him stay alive.

413
00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:49.358
Or at least. I tried to.

414
00:26:50.651 --> 00:26:53.529
Wow. an alchemist goblin.

415
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.741
Well. you know. that's. uh.

416
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.576
that's pretty impressive...

417
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:03.289
God. you son of a bitch.

418
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:08.085
Captain!

419
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.921
I-I tried to stop him.

420
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:13.758
But I... but I was weak.

421
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:15.718
I failed.

422
00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:18.220
I'm not the man you thought I was.

423
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:20.431
I'm sorry.

424
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:22.475
No. no. no. No. you're...

425
00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:24.894
It's okay. No. you didn't fail.

426
00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:27.855
There. there. honey. It's okay.

427
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.999
You have lost her
trust Bren. The others will soon follow.

428
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:48.250
Silence.

429
00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:49.711
She's really getting under your skin.

430
00:27:49.794 --> 00:27:51.212
Tell me what the fuck she's saying.

431
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:53.172
You may not trust me. Beauregard.

432
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:55.257
-but we cannot do this here.
-Cool.

433
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:57.009
We're doing it here.

434
00:27:57.093 --> 00:28:00.971
The monk will snap your
neck when she finds out the truth.

435
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:03.015
-Shut your mouth!
-Oh. yeah.

436
00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:04.517
You two are total strangers. huh?

437
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.852
Spill it. You working with her?

438
00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:08.270
<i>Nein.</i>

439
00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:10.106
Kill her. while you still can.

440
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:12.691
<i>-Nein.</i>
-Then who the fuck are you?

441
00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.068
Just tell her.

442
00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:16.320
You are still Volstrucker.

443
00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:21.033
Now. that I understood.

444
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:29.125
It hurts so much.

445
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.128
Yeah. but that's okay.

446
00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:35.464
You will not have to endure it alone.

447
00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:42.972
Master Ikithon called us "Volstrucker"?

448
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:47.226
I was supposed to be a farmer.

449
00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.353
You have a purpose now.

450
00:28:49.437 --> 00:28:52.273
These arms make us something new.

451
00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:54.316
Something powerful.

452
00:28:55.985 --> 00:29:00.364
It's frightening. but it's beautiful.

453
00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:03.659
Bren.

454
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:06.328
You are beautiful.

455
00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:12.001
Whatever we are. we will be together.

456
00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:33.105
Do you see the monk?

457
00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:35.357
Not yet. Foxstep.

458
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.738
Remember our first dance lesson?

459
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:44.116
I remember thinking
it was a waste of time.

460
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.036
Who knew it was the easiest way
to infiltrate a party?

461
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.621
You were a menace.

462
00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:50.122
Almost broke my foot.

463
00:29:50.206 --> 00:29:52.374
And now?

464
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:55.377
Now you are merely clumsy.

465
00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:01.091
Ooh.

466
00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:02.718
Thank you. Herr Bren.

467
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.136
{\an8}See?

468
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.263
{\an8}I am not a complete amateur.

469
00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:09.141
<i>Maybe save the flirting
for after the mission?</i>

470
00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:11.101
Where's the target?

471
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:13.062
No need to be jealous. Wulf.

472
00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:15.189
I will let you dip me later.

473
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:17.733
Psst. There he is.

474
00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:32.164
<i>Brada-unneen.</i>

475
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.505
We secured the key.

476
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:41.715
<i>Bring the thunder. big guy.</i>

477
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.677
Music to my arms.

478
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.640
What's happening?

479
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:51.058
It's a Crick attack.

480
00:30:52.142 --> 00:30:54.093
-Where should we go?
-Try to stay calm.

481
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.281
Halt!
Only Cobalt Soul allowed.

482
00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:10.202
Yah!

483
00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:26.176
Not another step.

484
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.554
I'll take them. Go.

485
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:39.064
<i>Visda-Revelo.</i>

486
00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.709
That was a warning.

487
00:31:58.792 --> 00:32:02.171
You must be brave or stupid
to break into the Soul.

488
00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:05.382
There is no place on this continent
you can hide from us.

489
00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:09.219
so I suggest you spill your guts
and give up your patron.

490
00:32:09.303 --> 00:32:11.805
Maybe you should spill yours.

491
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:14.058
<i>Lebmac Nitsirk.</i>

492
00:32:30.532 --> 00:32:33.077
Tired of this shit.

493
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.244
Who are you?

494
00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:35.913
Do not do this now. Beauregard.

495
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.917
You are a killer.
Follow your instincts.

496
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.002
Kill her. then come home.

497
00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:44.463
Father still loves you.

498
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:53.597
{\an8}Oh. you son of a bitch.
You're a Volstrucker.

499
00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:56.850
Give me one good reason
not to snap your neck right now.

500
00:32:56.934 --> 00:32:59.561
<i>Nein. Nein...</i>

501
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:01.438
W-We are...

502
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:04.775
Well? What do you have to say?

503
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:07.319
We took our eyes off her.

504
00:33:09.905 --> 00:33:10.948
Ah. shit.

505
00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:14.785
Get back!

506
00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:24.128
Oh. the prisoner's free.

507
00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:25.796
I'm sure that's totally on purpose.

508
00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:27.965
She did become our bestie.

509
00:33:29.925 --> 00:33:31.260
Nope. Not a bestie.

510
00:33:36.557 --> 00:33:38.642
Get her ass.

511
00:33:38.726 --> 00:33:40.310
<i>Neirbo Mael.</i>

512
00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:50.904
You wanted to know me?

513
00:33:50.988 --> 00:33:53.198
This is who I am.

514
00:34:00.122 --> 00:34:02.666
Ah. my prized pupils.

515
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.418
Congratulations.

516
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:07.212
Your success will help
keep the Empire safe.

517
00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:09.339
You have earned this feast.

518
00:34:09.423 --> 00:34:12.259
Don't mind if I do.

519
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:15.179
You have the manners of this pig.

520
00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:17.765
You think this body fuels itself?

521
00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:24.980
This reminds me of the day we met. Bren.
don't you think?

522
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.857
Much less humble. sir.

523
00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:30.527
It's a shame about your village.

524
00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:33.447
The Zemni Fields are now
being used as a rebel base

525
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.532
to spread lies against the king.

526
00:34:35.616 --> 00:34:37.159
Ungrateful traitors.

527
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:39.912
We should drag them out of their hovels
in the dead of night.

528
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:42.956
Mm. No. it should be public.

529
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.416
A flogging.

530
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.418
Something to send a message.

531
00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:47.795
Hmm.

532
00:34:47.878 --> 00:34:49.421
Bren?

533
00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:52.174
What would you do to traitors?

534
00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:57.679
The greatest fear of the Zemni people
is losing their livelihood.

535
00:34:57.763 --> 00:35:00.349
I would raze their farms to the ground.

536
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:04.228
then hang their ashen corpses
along the King's Way as a warning to all:

537
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:07.815
this is what the Empire does
with traitors.

538
00:35:07.898 --> 00:35:09.441
-Hear. hear.
-Hear. hear.

539
00:35:09.525 --> 00:35:11.235
Hmm.

540
00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:14.154
I am happy to hear you say that.

541
00:35:14.238 --> 00:35:16.240
Because you have a new mission:

542
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:19.743
to put down the Zemni rebellion.

543
00:35:19.827 --> 00:35:22.162
These missives contain a list of traitors.

544
00:35:22.246 --> 00:35:25.040
as named by the King's spymasters.

545
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:27.918
However. it. uh...

546
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:30.504
it comes with difficult news. Bren.

547
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:34.174
You may recognize some names on the list.

548
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:05.289
I heard you'd wasted away
in a sanatorium.

549
00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:06.832
Forgot even how to speak.

550
00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:10.127
But you're less rusty than I expected.

551
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.255
All those lessons never really leave you.

552
00:36:14.464 --> 00:36:17.551
<i>Weshun. Felinth-ono-Bladros.</i>

553
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:32.900
I... Everyone all right out there?

554
00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.278
Stay alive. Please.

555
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:40.908
Where's Caleb?

556
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:42.451
He's dead?

557
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.205
Trapped in a well?

558
00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:48.957
Rune trap.

559
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:50.709
Buried alive? What are you saying?

560
00:36:50.792 --> 00:36:52.044
Rune trap.

561
00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:53.795
What's a "poon clap"?

562
00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:57.299
Oh. he used a rune trap to stop you

563
00:36:57.382 --> 00:36:59.509
so he could follow the poison lady alone.

564
00:37:01.762 --> 00:37:03.972
Wait. you left him alone?

565
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:07.184
Okay. okay. Relax.

566
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:09.770
He's used this trick before.
It only lasts a minute.

567
00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:12.856
Okay. Jessie. when you're free.
brew the flowers into a tea

568
00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.733
and give it to Fjord before he croaks.

569
00:37:14.816 --> 00:37:16.818
You probably have... eh. ten minutes.

570
00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:18.654
I don't know. Uh. I'll go get Caleb.

571
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:20.322
You can thank me later.

572
00:37:23.533 --> 00:37:26.495
I never understood
why you were his favorite.

573
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.372
I never betrayed him.

574
00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:30.332
I never ran away.

575
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:32.709
Yet. all he wants is to find you.

576
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.032
There's the Bren I knew.

577
00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:08.203
Master Ikithon will never stop
sending us until you come home.

578
00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:21.383
<i>Everyone you love will die.</i>

579
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:32.853
At least it will not be by your hand.

580
00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:10.265
Bren!

581
00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:27.240
<i>The little spark who became</i>

582
00:39:27.324 --> 00:39:28.825
<i>a firestorm.</i>

583
00:39:39.628 --> 00:39:43.965
<i>You. my boy. are special.</i>

584
00:39:50.931 --> 00:39:52.849
<i>Accept the pain.</i>

585
00:39:59.189 --> 00:40:01.483
<i>Endure it.</i>

586
00:40:38.603 --> 00:40:40.313
Caleb!

587
00:40:51.283 --> 00:40:53.285
It's okay. It'll be okay.

588
00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:54.744
I'm here.

589
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:18.518
The mad fire wizard.
rising like a phoenix.

590
00:41:18.602 --> 00:41:20.353
How you feeling?

591
00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.107
Eh. sounds about right.

592
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:28.028
I'll say this: we've got questions.

593
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:29.487
But. hey. well done.

594
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:30.822
You made it to a new day.

595
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:34.451
and each new day
is a new opportunity to be someone...

596
00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:37.287
well. new.

597
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.041
So. who would you like to be today?

598
00:41:47.214 --> 00:41:49.174
Ugh. Bleh.

599
00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:51.843
This shit tastes like shit.

600
00:41:51.927 --> 00:41:54.262
How do you know
what shit tastes like. hmm?

601
00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:55.972
-Drink up.
-Hmm?

602
00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:58.391
Ugh.

603
00:41:58.475 --> 00:42:00.685
Your friend's got problems. kid.

604
00:42:00.769 --> 00:42:02.938
Yeah. like you're a peach.

605
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.274
I'm just saying.
he's gonna get you into trouble.

606
00:42:06.358 --> 00:42:08.568
if he keeps making you clean up
his messes.

607
00:42:08.652 --> 00:42:11.363
Caleb doesn't make me do anything.

608
00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:15.325
Really? 'Cause you guys
have very parent-child vibes.

609
00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:17.369
Maybe.

610
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:19.746
But I am the parent.

611
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:21.998
You do understand that. correct?

612
00:42:22.082 --> 00:42:25.418
I keep him safe
so he can get better and stronger

613
00:42:25.502 --> 00:42:27.545
and achieve great things.

614
00:42:27.629 --> 00:42:29.381
When I found him. he was nothing.

615
00:42:29.464 --> 00:42:32.550
Just a scared little boy
in the corner of an alley.

616
00:42:32.634 --> 00:42:34.427
It's my job to protect him.

617
00:42:34.511 --> 00:42:37.222
I protect him.

618
00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.932
He's my boy.

619
00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:41.351
And he'll be a great man someday.

620
00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.436
Does he know all that?

621
00:42:44.521 --> 00:42:47.190
I don't know what he knows.

622
00:42:55.365 --> 00:42:58.785
I weirdly want to beat his ass but also...

623
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:01.288
-hug him right now.
-I wouldn't.

624
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:04.082
The smell won't come off
your clothes for days.

625
00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:08.003
I think you owe us some words.
trash-wizard.

626
00:43:10.797 --> 00:43:13.633
You are right. I do.

627
00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:23.560
I have not been entirely honest with you.

628
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:27.022
But that ends today.

629
00:43:29.024 --> 00:43:31.067
Let me tell you a story.

630
00:44:27.123 --> 00:44:29.042
Chirp.
