00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:26.796
<i>- Answer the phone.
- Where's my suitcase?</i>

2
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.718
<i>I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?</i>

3
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:35.388
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

4
00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:38.558
Hey. hey. little boy.

5
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:40.977
- Excuse me. girls. Girls.
- Take the witches!

6
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.188
Hey. Hey. big fella.
Excuse me.

7
00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:45.598
Come help me make up these
beds in the living room!

8
00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:46.633
Excuse me. Ma'am!

9
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.110
- Hi. Hey. son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

10
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:52.739
Big fella! Hey! Hey. hey. hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

11
00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:57.202
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh. it's crazy.

12
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.579
- Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

13
00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.706
- Uh-huh.
- That's right. Her family's there.

14
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.708
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

15
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.752
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready. are you?

16
00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:10.590
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie. but the big kids can.

17
00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.468
- Why can't I?
- Kevin. I'm on the phone.

18
00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:16.054
When do you come back?
Not till then?

19
00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.516
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

20
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.852
Kevin. if Uncle Frank says no...

21
00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:25.146
then it must be really bad.

22
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.398
No. we're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him--

23
00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:29.943
Hey. hey. hey! Get off.
Kevin. out of the room.

24
00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.445
Hang up the phone and make me.
why don't ya?

25
00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:33.313
Oh. this kid.

26
00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.474
Kate. did you by any chance pick
up a voltage adapter thing?

27
00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.451
I didn't have time to do that.

28
00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:40.453
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

29
00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:43.456
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad. nobody'll let me do anything.

30
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.458
I've got something
for you to do.

31
00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:48.002
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

32
00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:50.964
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

33
00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.071
<i>He was in the garage again
playing with the glue gun.</i>

34
00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:54.158
Didn't we talk about that?

35
00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.262
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

36
00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.514
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

37
00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.391
My new fishhooks?

38
00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:06.229
I can't make ornaments out of the old ones.
with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

39
00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.191
- Peter.
- Come on. Kevin. Out.

40
00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.777
Peter. Kate. do you guys
have a voltage adapter?

41
00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:16.114
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter.
- Oh. you're getting heavy.

42
00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:18.366
Go pack your suitcase.

43
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.620
Pack my suitcase?

44
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.206
- Do you know where the shampoo is. Fuller?
- I don't live here.

45
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.750
A house with this many people.
there's no shampoo?

46
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:30.003
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah. but they don't live here.

47
00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:32.797
<i>- Tracy. did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.</i>

48
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:36.176
<i>- Excuse me. miss. Are your parents here?</i>
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

49
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.178
- Hi!
- Hi!

50
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.804
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.848
- Do they live here?
- No.

52
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.895
No. Why should they? All kids. no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

53
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.065
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done this once in my whole life.

54
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.443
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

55
00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:56.237
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin. "tough."

56
00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:59.073
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

57
00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.659
Shake his hand and say.
"Congratulations. you're an idiot"?

58
00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.704
- I'm not an idiot!
- Oh. really? You're completely helpless!

59
00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:07.498
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right. Kev.

60
00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:11.461
Excuse me. puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller
than you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

61
00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:15.131
- I hope you didn't just pack crap. Jeff.
- Shut up. Linnie.

62
00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.133
Do you know what
I should pack?

63
00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:20.553
Buzz told you. cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

64
00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:23.556
Listen. Kev. what are
you so worried about?

65
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.434
<i>You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.</i>

66
00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.771
<i>You're what the French call
Les incompetents.</i>

67
00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:33.858
- What?
- Bombs away!

68
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.908
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

69
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:45.745
If he has something to drink.
he's gonna wet the bed.

70
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.623
This house is so full of people.
it makes me sick!

71
00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:51.751
When I grow up and get married.
I'm livin' alone!

72
00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:54.671
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

73
00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.507
<i>I'm livin' alone!</i>

74
00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:02.262
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

75
00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:06.766
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

76
00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:11.437
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

77
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:14.190
Some don't.

78
00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:16.192
But they got nude beaches.

79
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:19.320
Not in the winter.

80
00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:27.745
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock. phlegm-wad?

81
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:31.374
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

82
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.459
If he has something to drink.
he'll wet the bed.

83
00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:38.173
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

84
00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:43.136
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

85
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.641
Who is he?

86
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:53.104
<i>You ever heard
of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!</i>

87
00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:55.148
<i>- No.
- That's him.</i>

88
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.986
<i>Back in '58. he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...</i>

89
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:03.448
with a snow shovel.

90
00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:06.868
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

91
00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:10.455
Well. if he's the Shovel Slayer.
how come the cops don't arrest him?

92
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.498
Not enough evidence to convict.

93
00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:15.126
<i>They never found the bodies.</i>

94
00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:17.462
<i>But everyone around here
knows he did it.</i>

95
00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:21.299
Now it'll just be a matter of time
before he does it again.

96
00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.384
What's he doin' now?

97
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.430
<i>He walks up and down
the streets every night...</i>

98
00:06:27.514 --> 00:06:29.849
<i>salting the sidewalks.</i>

99
00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:31.893
<i>Maybe he's just trying to be nice.</i>

100
00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.855
No way.

101
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.983
See that garbage can full of salt?

102
00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:42.070
<i>That's where he keeps his victims.</i>

103
00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:45.073
<i>The salt turns the bodies...</i>

104
00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:47.992
<i>into mummies.</i>

105
00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:51.037
- Wow.
- Mummies.

106
00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.418
Look out!

107
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.781
As soon as I get something
on that old maniac-

108
00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:09.305
I'm calling the FBI and turn his ass in
for the reward money.

109
00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.764
And you.

110
00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:16.588
If you don't get out of my room
I'm going to nail you-

111
00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:20.112
to Marleys front door
and ring the door bell.

112
00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:22.336
Go!

113
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.570
That micro-weenie has
the guts of a butterfly.

114
00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.856
<i>How you kids doin'. huh? Good?</i>

115
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.859
Lot of action
around here today. huh?

116
00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.654
Where you goin' away?
Vacation?

117
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.242
Where you goin'?
Disney world?

118
00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.166
Disney land?

119
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.796
Okay. that's 122.50.

120
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.882
Not for me. kid.
I don't live here.

121
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.927
- Oh. You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

122
00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:36.089
Well. you dinks are my witnesses.
I was here in 30 minutes or less!

123
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.853
Hey you!

124
00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:46.477
- Parlez-vous francais yet. Squirt?
- My name is Kevin.

125
00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:48.501
Your name's Kevin?

126
00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:51.725
You know what they'll call you
in France. don't ya?

127
00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:54.749
- No?
- Yank!

128
00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.720
- Hey. pizzas are here guys!
- Here you go. That's 122.50.

129
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.416
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

130
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.806
Excuse me miss. are you Mrs. McCallister?

131
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.707
- Yes. I am.
<i>- Oh good.</i>

132
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.231
Oh. I'm not the Mrs. McCallister
who lives here.

133
00:09:11.255 --> 00:09:13.255
<i>Frank!</i>

134
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.891
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

135
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.310
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

136
00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:23.338
- Yes.
- Oh. good. 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

137
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.067
- Am I under arrest or something?
- I'd like a word with you. sir.

138
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.987
You know. it's Christmastime.
There's a lot of burglaries.

139
00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:35.492
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

140
00:09:35.516 --> 00:09:38.451
- Is something wrong?
- Just want to see how you're set up.

141
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:42.583
Yeah. Well. automatic timers
on our lights. locks for our doors

142
00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:44.693
-that sort of stuff.
Yeah. we do all of that.

143
00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:47.717
Hey. look. I'm really sorry
but can I have my 122.50?

144
00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.954
- Hmm?
- My money?

145
00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:52.978
Gee. my wife got all the cash
she'll be down in a minute.

146
00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:55.604
- You get some eggnog?
- Eggnog?

147
00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.906
Come on. Dad.
Let's eat.

148
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.963
Eggnog? Listen. are you gonna...
when are you leaving. uh--

149
00:10:00.987 --> 00:10:04.587
You can get arrested for interrupting
people when they are trying to talk. kid?

150
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:06.711
God. I'm sorry.

151
00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:09.935
You live around here?

152
00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.359
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

153
00:10:12.483 --> 00:10:14.883
- One of these big homes?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:19.507
Maybe we should check your house out too.
Is it close by?

155
00:10:20.031 --> 00:10:23.031
Oh yeah. I can walk you over there I guess.

156
00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.001
Yeah. yeah. yeah wait just a minute.

157
00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:28.028
<i>Grab yourself a napkin.
You're gonna have to pour your own drinks.</i>

158
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.339
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

159
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.674
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

160
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.260
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

161
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:39.598
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want
to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

162
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.859
Honey. the pizza boy needs
$122.50. plus a tip.

163
00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:43.877
For pizza?

164
00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.812
<i>10 pizzas times 12 bucks.</i>

165
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:48.440
- Frank. you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

166
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.401
Forget it. Frank.
We have cash.

167
00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:54.154
<i>You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.</i>

168
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.240
Did anyone order me
a plain cheese?

169
00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.785
Oh. yeah. we did.
But if you want any...

170
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:03.121
somebody's gonna have
to barf it all up. 'cause it's gone.

171
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.750
<i>Fuller!
Go easy on the Pepsi.</i>

172
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.927
Kev! Kevin. get a plate.

173
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.852
Wow!

174
00:11:25.978 --> 00:11:28.772
The passports! Watch it!

175
00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.984
<i>Help me out here!</i>

176
00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:34.903
Let's get these passports
out of here.

177
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.490
<i>- Kevin. get off of him!
- You moron!</i>

178
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:42.160
Are you okay. honey?
Come here. Are you all right?

179
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.037
What is the matter with you?

180
00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:47.040
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

181
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.418
<i>He knows I hate sausage
and olives and--</i>

182
00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:51.962
Look what you did.
you little jerk!

183
00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:08.103
- Kevin. get upstairs right now.
- Why?

184
00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:11.440
- Kevin. you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

185
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.275
- Kevin. upstairs!
- Say good night. Kevin.

186
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.654
- Good night. Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

187
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.073
Why do I always get treated
like scum?

188
00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.534
Oh. I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

189
00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.536
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

190
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:28.290
My brother-in-law drove in
from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

191
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:31.001
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

192
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.128
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

193
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.272
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

194
00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:37.674
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

195
00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:41.678
<i>and his kids are still going to school here.
and I guess he missed the whole family.</i>

196
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:44.389
<i>He's giving us this trip to Paris
so we can be together.</i>

197
00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:48.268
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes. we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

198
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.646
Excellent. Excellent.

199
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.899
If you'll excuse me. this one's
out of sorts. I'll be right back.

200
00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.818
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband already.

201
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.112
<i>And don't worry
about your home.</i>

202
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.615
It's in good hands.

203
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.954
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one that has to make trouble.

204
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.124
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

205
00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:15.837
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs. dummy.

206
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.507
- The third floor?
- Go.

207
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:21.843
- It's scary up there.
- Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a while.

208
00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:25.138
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

209
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.432
<i>He'll pee all over me.
I know it.</i>

210
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.559
Fine. We'll put him
somewhere else.

211
00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:32.187
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.815
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

213
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.903
Everyone in this family hates me.

214
00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.239
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

215
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.993
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family! Families suck!

216
00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:49.287
Stay up there. I don't want to
see you for the rest of the night.

217
00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:52.040
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

218
00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.835
<i>And I don't want to see
anybody else either.</i>

219
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.920
I hope you don't mean that.

220
00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:00.966
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow
morning and you didn't have a family.

221
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.594
<i>- No. I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.</i>

222
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:09.099
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

223
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.248
I wish they would all just disappear.

224
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:33.433
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

225
00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:45.278
Peter!

226
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.322
We slept in!

227
00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:07.092
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

228
00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:10.637
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando. Florida.

229
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:14.391
Well. actually. first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

230
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.060
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

231
00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:20.939
Do you know if it's cold there?
Do these vans get good gas mileage?

232
00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:23.984
Gee. kid. I don't know.
Hit the road.

233
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.989
Heather. do a head count.
Make sure everyone's in the vans.

234
00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.991
Where are the passports
and tickets?

235
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.993
I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

236
00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.995
How fast does this thing go?

237
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.041
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have 4-wheel drive?

238
00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:43.337
Look. I told you before. kid.
don't bother me. Now beat it.

239
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.763
Come on. Hurry up.

240
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:58.352
- Line up in front off the van.
- Did you take my batteries?

241
00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.812
<i>- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!</i>

242
00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:03.565
<i>Shut up.
I gotta take a head count.</i>

243
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.778
- 1. 2. 3. 4. 5--
- 11. 92. 12.

244
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.280
Buzz. don't be a moron.

245
00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:13.575
6. 7. 8...

246
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.244
9. 10. 11.

247
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.539
Okay. Half in this van. half in this van.
Come on. Let's go.

248
00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:22.167
Have a good trip.

249
00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.294
Bring me back something French.

250
00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.967
There's no way on earth we're gonna
make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

251
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:34.388
- Think positive. Frank.
- You be positive. I'll be realistic.

252
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.390
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- What?

253
00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.475
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

254
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:42.062
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma
Bell a couple of days to patch 'em up.

255
00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.606
- Especially around the holidays.
- Okay. thanks.

256
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:48.068
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven. including me.

257
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:52.948
5 boys. 6 girls. 4 parents. 2
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

258
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.649
This way!

259
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:31.236
<i>- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?</i>

260
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.905
No. you just made it.

261
00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:38.118
- Single seats only in coach. Take what's free.
- Thank you.

262
00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:40.412
I get a window seat!

263
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.833
<i>You kids are in coach.
We're up here.</i>

264
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.669
<i>Here are your seats. Five "A"and "B"
and four "A"and "B. "</i>

265
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.672
- I'll take your coats.
- Thank you.

266
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.674
Fasten your seat belts. please.

267
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.344
- Champagne. please. It's free. isn't it?
- Oh. yes.

268
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:59.097
- We made it.
- Do you believe it?

269
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:01.350
Hope we didn't forget anything.

270
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.648
Mom?

271
00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.605
Thank you.

272
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.900
- That's real crystal. It's real.
- Yeah. So?

273
00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:39.238
- Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em!
- I can't do that.

274
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.282
Put them in your purse!

275
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:45.294
Uh. yeah. yeah. fill it up. fill it up.
Fill it up. please.

276
00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:47.196
Thank you.

277
00:20:47.221 --> 00:20:50.700
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

278
00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:52.602
No. the kids are fine.

279
00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:56.556
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the family
station wagon. and it wasn't to France.

280
00:20:56.639 --> 00:20:59.876
We used to have to go over
to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

281
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.236
The kids are okay. They're
having the time of their lives.

282
00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.228
Yeah.

283
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.067
Somebody?!
Anybody?!

284
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:09.091
I'm starving!

285
00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:20.606
I don't remember the food groups.

286
00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:26.131
Hello...

287
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.079
Mom?

288
00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:32.833
Dad?

289
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:38.964
Mom? Dad?

290
00:21:41.007 --> 00:21:43.718
Where are you guys?

291
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.804
Buzz?

292
00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:49.182
Buzz?

293
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.146
Buzz?

294
00:21:57.899 --> 00:21:59.776
Megan?

295
00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:04.448
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

296
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:07.534
Rod? Uncle Frank?

297
00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.953
Uncle Frank. is this a joke?

298
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.750
<i>Megan? Linnie?</i>

299
00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:19.337
Is this a joke?

300
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:47.032
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

301
00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:07.636
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

302
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.324
I made my family disappear.

303
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.619
Kevin. you're completely helpless.

304
00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:37.290
<i>You know. Kevin. you're what
the French call Les incompetents.</i>

305
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:40.627
Kevin. I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.

306
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.713
Kevin. you are such a disease.

307
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:46.007
There are 15 people
in this house...

308
00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.927
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

309
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.347
Look what you did.
you little jerk.

310
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:59.312
I made my family disappear.

311
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.706
I'm free! Free! Free!

312
00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:29.593
Wow!

313
00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:39.269
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

314
00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:43.523
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

315
00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:46.610
Buzz. I'm going through
all your private stuff!

316
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:49.654
You better come out
and pound me!

317
00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:56.244
Buzz. your girlfriend!
Woof!

318
00:25:13.113 --> 00:25:15.513
For the crime of belonging to
my rashy brother

319
00:25:15.537 --> 00:25:19.337
and only allowed to be displayed
in the pigsty he calls his room.

320
00:25:19.361 --> 00:25:21.361
I sentenced you to death
by BB-wounds

321
00:25:21.385 --> 00:25:24.385
and falling all the way down in
the laundry shoot to the basement.

322
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:28.209
Where you'll get massive head injuries
and die instantly or on arrival.

323
00:25:47.005 --> 00:25:49.333
Five families gone on one block alone.

324
00:25:49.357 --> 00:25:51.857
And they all told me from their own mouths.

325
00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:53.881
It's almost too easy.

326
00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:58.705
Remember the good old days. when people
used to stay home for Christmas?

327
00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:01.329
<i>Now it's off to Hawaii or Aspen. or-</i>

328
00:26:02.453 --> 00:26:04.453
<i>Paris.</i>

329
00:26:05.077 --> 00:26:08.877
Whatever happened to just sittin' around
the fireplace with your family?

330
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.601
Yeah. Roastin' chestnuts

331
00:26:12.025 --> 00:26:14.425
Singin' Christmas Carols.

332
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:19.149
That's why I hate Christmas. Marv.
I hate it.

333
00:26:20.873 --> 00:26:24.073
People have become too cynical.
Too jaded.

334
00:26:24.397 --> 00:26:28.397
Just another sign of the ongoin' moral
decay of contemporary society.

335
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:30.921
That's all it is.
That's all it is.

336
00:26:32.845 --> 00:26:34.845
Yeah.

337
00:26:41.469 --> 00:26:44.069
So which house you wanna' hit first?

338
00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:01.244
Who is it?

339
00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:07.626
It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.

340
00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:10.837
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

341
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:14.132
<i>All right. Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

342
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:17.761
<i>- What money?
- Acey said you had some dough for me.</i>

343
00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:20.847
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

344
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:23.809
Acey said 10%.

345
00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:26.603
Too bad Acey ain't
in charge no more.

346
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.606
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- Guys. I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

347
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.693
You better come out
and stop me!

348
00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:35.404
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

349
00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:37.197
<i>Hey.</i>

350
00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:40.033
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you. Snakes.

351
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:43.954
I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...

352
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:47.165
<i>to get your ugly. yellow...</i>

353
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:49.376
<i>no-good keister off my property...</i>

354
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.586
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

355
00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:54.256
All right. Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

356
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:56.883
<i>1. 2. 10!</i>

357
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.609
Keep the change.
ya filthy animal.

358
00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:17.821
Mom!

359
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:31.752
What's the matter?

360
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:34.254
Honey?

361
00:28:34.338 --> 00:28:37.883
- I have a terrible feeling.
- About what?

362
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:41.094
That we didn't do something.

363
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:44.514
Oh. no. you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

364
00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:46.667
<i>We took care of everything.
Believe me. we did.</i>

365
00:28:46.693 --> 00:28:48.001
<i>Did I turn off the coffee?</i>

366
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.937
No. I did.

367
00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:53.023
<i>Did you lock up?</i>

368
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:55.025
Yeah.

369
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.778
Did you close the garage?

370
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:03.617
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

371
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:11.541
No. that's not it.

372
00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.920
What else could we be forgetting?

373
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.051
Kevin!

374
00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:49.955
Whoa!

375
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:54.751
Whoa! Whoa!

376
00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:28.368
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

377
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:32.914
We'll call as soon as we land. Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

378
00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:36.626
It's horrible. Horrible.
Just horrible.

379
00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:39.796
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

380
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:42.173
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

381
00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.552
What kind of mother am I?

382
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:49.389
<i>If it makes you feel any better.
I forgot my reading glasses.</i>

383
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:56.730
<i>5 families gone on one block alone.</i>

384
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:59.733
<i>They all told me from their own mouths.</i>

385
00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:01.776
<i>It's almost too easy.</i>

386
00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:05.780
Check it out. All the houses
with nobody home...

387
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:08.992
have automatic timers
on their lights.

388
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.953
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

389
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.958
Number 664 will be going on...

390
00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:20.295
right about... now.

391
00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:25.091
- Oh.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

392
00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.761
Number 672...

393
00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:31.723
right... now.

394
00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:35.018
<i>-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

395
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:39.356
671 ... now.

396
00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:44.819
And that's the one. Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

397
00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:47.072
Oh. it's very "G."

398
00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:50.116
Very "G. " huh?
It's loaded.

399
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.660
It's got lots of topflight goods.

400
00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:56.164
<i>- Stereos. VCR's.
- Toys.</i>

401
00:31:56.289 --> 00:32:00.752
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry.
Possible cash hoard.

402
00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:05.090
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows?

403
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:07.384
<i>It's a gem.</i>

404
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:09.469
Grab your crowbar.

405
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.681
Crowbars up.

406
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:12.865
Which way?

407
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:16.427
We'll go around back to the basement.
Follow me.

408
00:33:35.597 --> 00:33:37.682
I thought you said
they were gone.

409
00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:41.603
- They were supposed to leave this morning.
- Let's get out of here.

410
00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:09.027
They should be through customs by now.

411
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:13.051
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- Yeah. right over here. Come on.

412
00:34:14.475 --> 00:34:16.775
Okay. Let's try this sign Pete.

413
00:34:17.299 --> 00:34:19.299
Come on.
There you go.

414
00:34:19.323 --> 00:34:21.323
Let's unfold it!

415
00:34:22.847 --> 00:34:25.047
Okay. hold it up.
Watch for them!

416
00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:27.571
<i>I don't see them yet.
Keep looking.</i>

417
00:34:27.595 --> 00:34:29.595
<i>I... I think...</i>

418
00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:32.019
Hey Look! There they are!

419
00:34:32.443 --> 00:34:34.443
Wave to your cousins girls!

420
00:34:34.767 --> 00:34:36.967
Look how happy they are to see us!

421
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:57.191
<i>Hi everybody. welcome!</i>

422
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.686
We have to use the phone. please.

423
00:35:03.811 --> 00:35:06.563
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

424
00:35:06.647 --> 00:35:09.692
Please! Our brother's home alone.

425
00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:13.028
- Give us the phone!
- Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

426
00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:16.115
Peter. I'm gonna call the police.
Why don't you book us a flight home.

427
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.869
Get some change out of here.
Call everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

428
00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:24.164
<i>Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everybody who lives on our street.</i>

429
00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:26.166
Maybe somebody can help us.

430
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:30.379
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

431
00:35:35.509 --> 00:35:39.430
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

432
00:35:39.513 --> 00:35:43.642
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

433
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:53.819
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

434
00:35:55.279 --> 00:35:59.241
I said.
I'm not afraid anymore!

435
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:02.202

in a violent altercation...

447
00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:08.352
with a drunken and/or mentally ill
member of his immediate family?

448
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:12.398
- No.
- Has he been involved in a household accident?

449
00:37:12.523 --> 00:37:14.733
I don't know. I don't--
I hope not.

450
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:17.319
Has the child ingested any poison...

451
00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:20.114

lodged in his throat?

452
00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:23.826
No. he's just home alone! I would like

just to check on him?

455
00:37:30.624 --> 00:37:31.308
Yes!

456
00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:34.069

- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

458

<i>- Yeah?
- Hyper on two. Hold on. please.</i>

459
00:37:39.299 --> 00:37:43.220
No. please don't hang up.
Please. don't--Any luck?

460
00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:46.932
No. We couldn't get anybody.

461
00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:47.816
<i>Leslie?</i>

462
00:37:47.842 --> 00:37:50.878
<i>I'm sorry. Kate. Nothing but a
bunch of answering machines.</i>

463
00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:56.734
Somebody pick up.
Pick up!

464
00:37:56.817 --> 00:37:59.361
- Hi. ma'am. It's you again.
- Yeah. hi. Look.

465
00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:02.322
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone. and I--

466
00:38:02.448 --> 00:38:06.410
Okay. okay. We'll send a policeman
over to your house to check on your son.

467
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:39.318
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

468
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:42.488
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
- 10-4.

469
00:38:42.613 --> 00:38:45.157
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody--

470
00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:47.951
I'm sorry. but there's
no way I can do that.

471
00:38:48.035 --> 00:38:49.953
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

472
00:38:50.037 --> 00:38:52.581
- If you explained this is an emergency.
- I wish I could--

473
00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:55.167
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

474
00:38:55.292 --> 00:38:59.588
- That's a relief. Everything here is booked.
- There's nothing to Chicago?

475
00:38:59.713 --> 00:39:03.008
There's nothing to Chicago. New York.
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

476
00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:07.554
- What about a private plane?
- No. I'm sorry. We don't do that.

477
00:39:07.638 --> 00:39:10.641
The only thing they have is a booking
for all of us on Friday morning.

478
00:39:10.724 --> 00:39:12.976
Friday morning?
That's two days away.

479
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.562
Look. honey. the kids are exhausted.
You are exhausted.

480
00:39:15.646 --> 00:39:18.273
There's absolutely nothing more
we can do in this airport.

481
00:39:18.399 --> 00:39:22.486
I say we go to Rob's. we can call the
police. and they can get back to us.

482
00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:26.407
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

483
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.409
<i>Madame. we are doing
everything we can.</i>

484
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:32.413
If you want to stay at the airport.
maybe we can get you on a standby.

485
00:39:32.538 --> 00:39:35.958
<i>It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.</i>

486
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:39.169
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

487
00:39:44.258 --> 00:39:47.886
- Bye. I'll miss you.
- Bye.

488
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:50.931
<i>Find Kevin.</i>

489
00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:53.017
Don't you get lost.

490
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.227
Good-bye.

491
00:39:55.352 --> 00:39:57.271
<i>Good-bye. Kate.</i>

492
00:40:11.118 --> 00:40:14.621
I took a shower. washing
every body part with actual soap...

493
00:40:14.747 --> 00:40:19.251
including all my major crevices. including
in between my toes and in my belly button...

494
00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:21.795
which I never did before.
but sort of enjoyed.

495
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.548
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

496
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:27.801
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

497
00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:31.930
I can't seem to find my toothbrush.
so I'll pick one up when I go out today.

498
00:40:32.014 --> 00:40:34.058
Other than that.
I'm in good shape.

499
00:41:08.425 --> 00:41:10.344
Whoa!

500
00:41:24.274 --> 00:41:27.486
All right!
Buzz's life savings.

501
00:41:54.638 --> 00:41:57.516
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

502
00:42:13.407 --> 00:42:16.952
You know. you're one of the great
cat burglars of the world. Marv.

503
00:42:17.077 --> 00:42:19.259
You think you could keep
it down a little in there?

504
00:42:19.747 --> 00:42:24.543
<i>Hi. you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.</i>

505
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:29.423
<i>Chuck. this is Peter McCallister again. and
we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.</i>

506
00:42:29.548 --> 00:42:32.634
<i>Let me give you the number here. okay?
The country code is 3-3.</i>

507
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.636
<i>The area code is 1-4.</i>

508
00:42:34.762 --> 00:42:38.974
<i>- And the number is 694-8764.</i>
- Hey. Harry?

509
00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:39.892
Yeah?

510
00:42:39.918 --> 00:42:43.087
House we were at last night.
was that the McCallisters?

511
00:42:43.187 --> 00:42:45.606
<i>- Yeah.
- Call me in Paris.</i>

512
00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:48.275
You're right. They're gone.

513
00:42:51.695 --> 00:42:54.531
- I knew they were.
<i>- Silver tuna tonight.</i>

514
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.660
<i>Wow.</i>

515
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.292
How may I help you?

516
00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:10.254
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

517
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:13.132
Well. I don't know.

518
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:17.011
- It doesn't say. hon.
- Can you please find out?

519
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:22.016
<i>- Herb!
- Yeah?</i>

520
00:43:22.141 --> 00:43:25.937
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

521
00:43:31.484 --> 00:43:35.780
Do you know. is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

522
00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:37.782
I don't know.

523
00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:03.057
- Just tell him that--
- Oh. hon. you pay for that here.

524
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.059
<i>Why don't you just
tell him it's approved?</i>

525
00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.479
<i>Wait. son. you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?</i>

526
00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.565
<i>Son! Hey!</i>

527
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:14.360
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

528
00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:21.117
Hey! Hey!

529
00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:24.829
Shoplifter!

530
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.917
Hey! Hey. kid!

531
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:32.628
Come back here!

532
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:35.464
Watch it!

533
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:38.634
<i>Come back here!</i>

534
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:42.638
<i>Stop it. will ya!
Come here!</i>

535
00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.435
Whoa! Whoa!

536
00:44:49.103 --> 00:44:52.440
Whoa! Whoa!

537
00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:57.403
Yeehaw!

538
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.221
I'm a criminal.

539
00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:53.125
What's so funny?

540
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:55.878
<i>What's so funny?
What are you laughin' at?</i>

541
00:45:58.506 --> 00:46:00.508
You did it again. didn't you?

542
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:03.261
<i>You left the water runnin'. didn't you?</i>

543
00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:06.556
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to do it.

544
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:08.558
Harry. it's our calling card.

545
00:46:08.683 --> 00:46:11.394
<i>- Calling card.
- All the great ones leave their mark.</i>

546
00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:13.396
We're the "Wet Bandits."

547
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:16.357
You're sick. you know that?
You're really sick.

548
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.359
- I'm not sick.
- Yes. you are.

549
00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:20.403
- I'm not sick!
- That's a sick thing to do!

550
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:29.845
- We don't need that heat.
- Don't tell me what to do.

551
00:46:29.871 --> 00:46:31.188
I can do it if I want to.

552
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:34.041
<i>- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.</i>

553
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:37.253
<i>Hey. watch out!</i>

554
00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:47.346
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out
for traffic. son. you know?

555
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.891
- Sorry.
- Damn.

556
00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:52.226
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes. little buddy.

557
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.520
<i>Okay. okay.</i>

558
00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.940
Merry Christmas.

559
00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:10.745
- What's the matter?
- I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

560
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.747
<i>- Did you see that?
- You ever seen him before?</i>

561
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.541
I saw a hundred kids this week.

562
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.127
Let's see what house
he goes into.

563
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:52.036
<i>Why is he goin' faster?</i>

564
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:56.540
I told you something's wrong. I knew
he looked at me weird. Why would he run?

565
00:48:31.951 --> 00:48:35.997
<i>- Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not goin' in there.</i>

566
00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:39.174
<i>- Me neither.
- Ah. let's get out of here.</i>

567
00:48:42.498 --> 00:48:44.598
C'mon. we shouldn't be
followin' a kid anyway.

568
00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:46.622
It's like sending an invitation
to the cops.

569
00:48:46.646 --> 00:48:48.446
I don't like the way he looked at me.

570
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.670
C'mon Harry.
You're just gettin' an edge on ya.

571
00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:52.694
<i>Look. we're doin' good.</i>

572
00:48:52.718 --> 00:48:54.718
<i>C'mon now.</i>

573
00:48:54.742 --> 00:48:57.542
<i>Look. it's gettin' dark. right?
Here's what we'll do.</i>

574
00:48:57.566 --> 00:48:59.366
<i>We drop this stuff off.</i>

575
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.890
We get some to eat.
And then we'll come back.

576
00:49:01.914 --> 00:49:04.414
For some more Holiday surprises.

577
00:49:07.638 --> 00:49:09.638
Oh...

578
00:49:09.662 --> 00:49:13.662
You better watch out.
You better not hide.

579
00:49:14.086 --> 00:49:18.086
If your door's are open.
we're comin' inside.

580
00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:22.810
Harry and Marv are comin' to town!

581
00:49:25.034 --> 00:49:28.034
We know when you're out dancin'.

582
00:49:28.258 --> 00:49:31.058
We know just what to take.

583
00:49:31.782 --> 00:49:36.782
We know where all the money is hid.
So come on give us a break.

584
00:49:39.806 --> 00:49:43.806
You better watch out.
You better not hide.

585
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.330
If your door's are open.
we're comin' inside.

586
00:49:48.054 --> 00:49:52.254
Harry and Marv are comin' to town!

587
00:49:55.678 --> 00:49:59.678
What did you mean about...
that I have and edge. before?

588
00:50:00.102 --> 00:50:02.102
- Huh?
- What did you mean?

589
00:50:03.526 --> 00:50:05.526
I didn't say that.

590
00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:24.146
When those guys come back.
I'll be ready.

591
00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:52.383
<i>- Did they come back?
- From Paris?</i>

592
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:31.005
<i>We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone by then.</i>

593
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:35.176
We'd better get out of here
before somebody sees us.

594
00:52:06.113 --> 00:52:08.282
What are they saying?

595
00:52:08.306 --> 00:52:10.306
- I don't know. do you understand french?
- No.

596
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.552
Uuh.. Do you speak English?

597
00:52:17.677 --> 00:52:20.471
<i>Parlez anglais?</i>

598
00:52:20.638 --> 00:52:23.902
<i>Est ce qui un person
qui parle anglais?</i>

599
00:52:24.526 --> 00:52:26.554
No. no no... I don't speak french.

600
00:52:26.677 --> 00:52:29.922
- Did you get anybody?
- I can't get anybody.

601
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:34.244
Nobody's home for the holidays.
They've all gone shopping.

602
00:52:34.868 --> 00:52:36.345
Attention! Attention!

603
00:52:36.369 --> 00:52:40.369
- Look what I have found in "ze" kitchen!
- Frank. those are for later.

604
00:52:41.893 --> 00:52:43.893
Frank?

605
00:52:43.917 --> 00:52:47.917
Mes petites enfants.
do you want a little shrimp. eh?

606
00:52:51.341 --> 00:52:53.341
I didn't get one.

607
00:52:53.365 --> 00:52:56.765
Hey you. punk.
Sur le floor.

608
00:53:03.089 --> 00:53:05.089
- Megan.
- What?

609
00:53:07.113 --> 00:53:09.113
Megan...

610
00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.565
This is so pointless.

611
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:17.403
- What?
- We're here rotting in this apartment.

612
00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:19.697
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

613
00:53:19.922 --> 00:53:22.916
- So?
- You don't think it's weird?

614
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.440
No.

615
00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.495
You're not at all worried about Kevin?

616
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:29.498
Why should I be?

617
00:53:29.522 --> 00:53:31.522
He's home alone. you idiot.

618
00:53:31.546 --> 00:53:33.384
So. he deserves it.

619
00:53:33.408 --> 00:53:37.453
He's acted like a jerk once too many times.
and this time he caught it in the butt.

620
00:53:37.506 --> 00:53:42.011
But he's so little and...
Don't you think he's flipped out?

621
00:53:42.035 --> 00:53:46.035
Sure. He's probably going through a
stage ten brain fry-down right now.

622
00:53:46.059 --> 00:53:47.859
But he asked for it.

623
00:53:47.883 --> 00:53:49.883
You're really cruel.

624
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.230
<i>The little trout can use
a couple of days in the real world.</i>

625
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:55.891
<i>You're not worried that something
might happen to him?</i>

626
00:53:55.974 --> 00:53:58.277
No. For 3 reasons.

627
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.388
A: I'm not that lucky.

628
00:54:00.413 --> 00:54:02.007
2: We have smoke detectors.

629
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:05.992
And "D": We live in the most boring street
in the United States of America. where...

630
00:54:06.118 --> 00:54:11.197
nothing even remotely dangerous is ever.
did ever or will ever happen. period.

631
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:42.488
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Little Nero's. sir. I have your pizza.</i>

632
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.782
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell outta here.

633
00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:48.660
Okay.

634
00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.954
Um. well. what about the money?

635
00:54:52.164 --> 00:54:53.790
What money?

636
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:57.336
Well. you have to pay
for your pizza. sir.

637
00:54:57.419 --> 00:54:59.630
<i>Is that a fact?</i>

638
00:54:59.755 --> 00:55:01.924
How much do I owe you?

639
00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:05.302
<i>Uh. that'll be 11.80. sir.</i>

640
00:55:11.683 --> 00:55:15.020
Keep the change.
ya filthy animal.

641
00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:18.816
<i>- Cheapskate.
- Hey.</i>

642
00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:22.694
<i>I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get your ugly...</i>

643
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.114
<i>yellow. no-good keister
off my property...</i>

644
00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:28.408
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

645
00:55:28.534 --> 00:55:30.410
<i>1. 2. 10!</i>

646
00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:02.401
A lovely cheese pizza
just for me.

647
00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:08.073
<i>To Dallas-Fort Worth.</i>

648
00:56:11.493 --> 00:56:13.871
We have the $500.
the pocket translator...

649
00:56:13.954 --> 00:56:16.665
the two first-class seats--
that's an upgrade from your coach--

650
00:56:16.748 --> 00:56:20.544
- Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?

651
00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:23.338
- No.
- But who can tell?

652
00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:27.384
<i>- I also have a ring.
- That is beautiful!</i>

653
00:56:27.509 --> 00:56:29.512
Come on. They're boarding.

654
00:56:29.595 --> 00:56:32.899
This gal has offered us
two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

655
00:56:32.924 --> 00:56:36.427
Plus a ring. a watch.
a pocket translator. $500 and--

656
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:40.063
- The earrings. You love the earrings.
- She's got her own earrings.

657
00:56:40.189 --> 00:56:42.816
A whole shoe box full of' em.
Dangley ones.

658
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:44.902
- Come on. come on.
- No. but--

659
00:56:45.027 --> 00:56:47.029
I'm desperate.

660
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:48.989
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

661
00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:52.534
From a mother to a mother. please.

662
00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:56.622
<i>- Oh. Ed.
- Please.</i>

663
00:56:56.747 --> 00:56:59.416
<i>Oh. all right.</i>

664
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:13.040
Oh no! I just brushed my
teeth with stolen goods.

665
00:57:13.364 --> 00:57:15.364
Better wipe off the finger prints.

666
00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:18.101
"Dear Santa Claus.
I got a little sister last year.

667
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.395
This year I'd rather
have some clay dough."

668
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:09.619
I didn't mean it.

669
00:58:09.703 --> 00:58:12.573
If you come back.
I'll never be a pain in the butt again.

670
00:58:12.598 --> 00:58:15.059
I promise. Good night.

671
00:58:29.715 --> 00:58:32.885
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

672
00:58:33.135 --> 00:58:34.345
<i>Of a white</i>

673
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:37.097
<i>Christmas</i>

674
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:41.852
<i>Just like the ones I used to know</i>

675
00:58:44.063 --> 00:58:47.858
<i>Where those treetops glisten</i>

676
00:58:48.067 --> 00:58:51.695
<i>And children listen</i>

677
00:58:51.904 --> 00:58:56.951
<i>To hear sleigh bells
In the snow</i>

678
00:58:57.701 --> 00:58:59.370
<i>The snow</i>

679
00:59:35.194 --> 00:59:38.694
- Pushin' the cart for mommy?
- Yes. ma'am.

680
00:59:38.718 --> 00:59:40.718
What a good little helper you are.

681
00:59:40.742 --> 00:59:44.742
I'll bet you'll get lots of swell things
from Santa tomorrow morning.

682
00:59:44.766 --> 00:59:46.766
You never know.

683
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:50.290
Excuse me. what's the stuff you put
in the washing machine-

684
00:59:50.314 --> 00:59:55.314
to make your clothes feel as fluffy soft as a
kitten and smell fresh as a springtime breeze?

685
00:59:56.238 --> 00:59:58.038
Fabric softener?

686
00:59:58.062 --> 01:00:01.062
- It's for mommy.
- It's on isle two.

687
01:00:02.086 --> 01:00:05.086
Thank you. have a most Merry Christmas.

688
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:07.410
You too.

689
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.054
Are those microwave dinners
any good?

690
01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:44.474
- I don't know.
- I'll give 'em a whirl.

691
01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:51.523
For the kids.

692
01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:56.444
Hold on.
I got a coupon for that.

693
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:59.239
It was in the paper this morning.

694
01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.912
- 19.83.
- Okay.

695
01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.542
Are you here all by yourself?

696
01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:16.173
Ma'am. I'm 8 years old.
You think I would be here alone?

697
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.592
I don't think so.

698
01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:20.969
- Where's your mom?
- My mom's in the car.

699
01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.472
<i>- And where is your father?
- He's at work.</i>

700
01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:26.350
- What about your brothers and your sisters?
- I'm an only child.

701
01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.936
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you that.

702
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:32.064
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a stranger.

703
01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:14.439
Hello. Kevin!

704
01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.653
<i>Shut up.</i>

705
01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:34.209
I don't get it.

706
01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.004
I mean. right now it looks
like there's nobody home.

707
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:40.674
Last night the place is jumpin'.

708
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:44.511
Somethin' ain't right.
Go check it out.

709
01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:55.022
Now?

710
01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:57.024
No. tomorrow. egghead. Now!

711
01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:59.776
<i>Go ahead!</i>

712
01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.070
"Now?"

713
01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:21.457
<i>Shit.</i>

714
01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:26.512
- Get the hell outta here.
- All right. Johnny.

715
01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:29.723
<i>- But what about my money?
- What money?</i>

716
01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:32.518
<i>Acey said you had
some dough for me.</i>

717
01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:37.523
<i>- Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?
- Acey said 10%.</i>

718
01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:42.611
<i>- Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.
- What do you mean?</i>

719
01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:46.114
<i>He's upstairs taking a bath.</i>

720
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.909
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

721
01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.911
<i>Hey.</i>

722
01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:54.039
<i>I tell you what
I'm gonna give you. Snakes.</i>

723
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:57.960
<i>- Snakes?
- I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...</i>

724
01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:00.379
<i>to get your ugly. yellow...</i>

725
01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:04.925
no-good keister off my property
before I pump your guts full of lead.

726
01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.719
<i>All right. Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.</i>

727
01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:10.764
<i>1. 2. 10!</i>

728
01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:33.162
<i>Keep the change.
ya filthy animal.</i>

729
01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:38.242
What happened?

730
01:04:38.268 --> 01:04:41.770
I don't know who's in there. but
somebody just got blown away!

731
01:04:41.855 --> 01:04:43.856
Somebody beat us to the job.
They're in there!

732
01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:48.260
Two of' em. They was arguing.
One of' em blew the other one away.

733
01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.053
- Who?
- I don't know.

734
01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:52.598
<i>I thought I recognized
one of their voices.</i>

735
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:55.893
And I know I heard that name
Snakes before.

736
01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:58.479
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.

737
01:04:58.604 --> 01:05:00.689
- I don't know no Snakes.
<i>- Snakes.</i>

738
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.358
Let's get out of here.

739
01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.447
Hold it. hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

740
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.449
We work this neighborhood too.

741
01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:13.327
<i>- Yeah.
- Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...</i>

742
01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:16.455
and they start asking us questions
about a murder in the area.

743
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:19.666
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with their questions?

744
01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:23.504
That's a good idea.

745
01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:27.049
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

746
01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:30.052
He sounded like a snake.

747
01:05:40.176 --> 01:05:42.176
Dad?

748
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.200
Linnie what are you doing up. sweet heart?

749
01:05:46.024 --> 01:05:48.024
Have you heard from Kevin?

750
01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:50.348
No.

751
01:05:50.372 --> 01:05:52.372
You wanna sit down?

752
01:05:58.896 --> 01:06:00.896
Where's mom?

753
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.520
I think she ran off with
some Parisian Playboy.

754
01:06:06.244 --> 01:06:08.244
Dad.

755
01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:12.268
She just got on to a plane to
Scranton. to go back and get Kevin.

756
01:06:14.192 --> 01:06:18.192
She won't be here from Christmas.
Kevin won't be here for Christmas.

757
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.516
It won't even be like Christmas.

758
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.540
Well let's postpone Christmas a day.

759
01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:25.564
I think that's a bad idea.

760
01:06:25.588 --> 01:06:27.588
We don't have much choice. sweetheart.

761
01:06:29.112 --> 01:06:31.312
Family shouldn't be apart on Christmas.

762
01:06:31.836 --> 01:06:35.836
No matter how mean they are to
each other the rest of the year.

763
01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.260
Us here. them there.
It's stupid dad.

764
01:06:39.584 --> 01:06:41.584
Christmas isn't about Paris.

765
01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:44.808
What is Christmas about?

766
01:06:46.232 --> 01:06:48.232
Christmas is about...

767
01:06:48.556 --> 01:06:50.556
Families. Being together.

768
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080
Atta girl...

769
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.798
Everything's full.

770
01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.731
Everything's full?

771
01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.066
I'm very sorry.
but it is Christmas Eve.

772
01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.319
What about another airline?

773
01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.702
Nothing available.
May I help you get a hotel room in the city?

774
01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.121
<i>Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.</i>

775
01:07:22.147 --> 01:07:23.356
I can't wait that long.

776
01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:27.835
I'm terribly sorry. ma'am. but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

777
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:35.134
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go. people to see.

778
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.554
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

779
01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:42.683
<i>I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.</i>

780
01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:47.229
I have been from Chicago to Paris
to Dallas to--Where the hell am I?

781
01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.357
Scranton.

782
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.109
I am trying to get home
to my 8-year-old son!

783
01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:55.613
And now that I'm this close.
you're telling me it's hopeless?

784
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:59.367
- I'm sorry.
- No. No. no. no. no way. This is Christmas!

785
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:01.369
The season of perpetual hope!

786
01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.243
<i>Ma'am. if I--</i>

787
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:05.272
<i>If I have to get out on
your runway and hitchhike...</i>

788
01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:07.291
if it costs me everything I own...

789
01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:10.252
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself...

790
01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:13.547
I am going to get home
to my son.

791
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:16.934
<i>Ma'am. if there was anything at
all I could do for you today--</i>

792
01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.785
Do it.

793
01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:20.471
<i>- Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.</i>

794
01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:23.015
- What?
- Excuse me.

795
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:28.813
<i>Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see you
for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.</i>

796
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.108
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

797
01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.819
We got a crisis ourselves.

798
01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:38.364
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

799
01:08:38.489 --> 01:08:41.909
Polka king of the Midwest?

800
01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.540
The Kenosha Kickers?

801
01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:49.291
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

802
01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:52.253
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized--

803
01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:55.297
Anyways. uh. I had
a few hits a few years ago.

804
01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:58.676
Uh. that's why. you know--
"Polka. Polka. Polka"?

805
01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:03.264
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

806
01:09:03.347 --> 01:09:06.809
"Yamahoozie Polka. "
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

807
01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.562
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

808
01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.065
Yeah. Yeah. We--
Some fairly big hits for us.

809
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.776
- You know. in the early '70s. you know?
- Oh.

810
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.487
Yeah. we sold
about 623 copies of that.

811
01:09:18.612 --> 01:09:21.240
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

812
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:23.492
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

813
01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:25.745
Anyway. I'm rambling on here.

814
01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.914
<i>Our flight was canceled.
so we gotta drive.</i>

815
01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:32.585
So. uh. see the guy in the yellow jacket
over there by the Budget sign?

816
01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:36.422
<i>He's gonna rent us a nice big. uh. van.
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.</i>

817
01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:40.801
I heard you had some problems here. uh. gettin'
to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

818
01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:45.014
Uh. my son. He--
We left and he's there.

819
01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:49.226
<i>Aw. geez. If you have to get
to Chicago. we'll gladly drive you.</i>

820
01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:51.604
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

821
01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:54.315
<i>- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not. you know?</i>

822
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.984
<i>- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?</i>

823
01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:58.944
Sure. You know.
it's Christmas time.

824
01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.572
Thank you.
Oh. thank you.

825
01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.991
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

826
01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:05.993
No. I'd love to.

827
01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.601
- Hey. Marv. Marv. Marv.
- What?

828
01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:33.187
Look at this.

829
01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:42.113
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

830
01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:14.770
Dad. can you come here
and help me?

831
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:23.529
Remember that kid we saw
the other day? He lives here.

832
01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:26.532
Well. if the kid's there.
the parents gotta be.

833
01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.201
He's home alone.

834
01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:39.420
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

835
01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:41.422
- Uh-huh.
- Even with the kid here?

836
01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:43.632
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

837
01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:47.219
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

838
01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.014
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house. I wanted it.

839
01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:52.475
<i>So let's take it
one step at a time. okay?</i>

840
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.062
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

841
01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:59.106
<i>- 9:00.
- This way it's dark then.</i>

842
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:02.318
Yeah. Kids are scared
of the dark.

843
01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.279
You're afraid of the dark too. Marv.
You know you are.

844
01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:08.074
No. I'm not!

845
01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.660
- Yes. you are.
- I'm not. not. not.

846
01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:14.997
<i>- You are so.
- Mom. where are you?</i>

847
01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:30.304
Do you play?

848
01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:32.473
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

849
01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:34.809
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

850
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.978
Okay.

851
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.630
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

852
01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:08.718
<i>- Hey. nice shoes.
- Oh. thanks.</i>

853
01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:12.471
Is he still here? It's really important
that I see him.

854
01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:17.852
He's getting in his car. I guess
if you hurry. you can catch him.

855
01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:22.398
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris Kringle
a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

856
01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:25.609
What's next?
Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

857
01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.321
Santa. hold on!

858
01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.531
Can I talk to you for a minute?

859
01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:33.617
If you make it quick. Santa's got
a little get-together he's late for.

860
01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.619
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

861
01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:39.623
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

862
01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:42.376
I'm old enough
to know how it works.

863
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.546
<i>- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.</i>

864
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:48.674
<i>- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.</i>

865
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:52.887
I'm Kevin McCallister.
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

866
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.640
- Do you need the phone number?
- No. that's all right.

867
01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.933
Okay.
This is extremely important.

868
01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:02.855
Would you please tell him that. instead of
presents this year. I just want my family back.

869
01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:07.860
<i>No toys. Nothing but Peter.
Kate. Buzz. Megan. Linnie and Jeff.</i>

870
01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.154
And my aunt and my cousins.

871
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.449
And. if he has time.
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

872
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.329
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

873
01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:21.374
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

874
01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.585
My elf took the last of the candy canes
home to her boyfriend.

875
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.754
- That's okay.
- No. no. no. Don't be silly.

876
01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:29.840
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

877
01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.134
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

878
01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:35.346
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

879
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:38.057
I won't. Thanks.

880
01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.529
Son of a--

881
01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.957
Merry Christmas.

882
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.500
Huh?

883
01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.669
May I sit down?

884
01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:08.643
That's my granddaughter up there.
The little red-haired girl.

885
01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.521
She's about your age.

886
01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:14.857
- Do you know her?
- No.

887
01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:18.027
- You live next to me. don't you?
- Yeah.

888
01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:22.615
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

889
01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.619
There's a lot of things going around
about me. but none of it's true.

890
01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.621
Okay?

891
01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.915
- You been a good boy this year?
- I think so.

892
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.125
<i>Swear to it?</i>

893
01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.920
- No.
- Yeah. I had a feeling.

894
01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.173
Well. this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

895
01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:42.176
<i>- It is?
- I think so.</i>

896
01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.971
<i>- Are you feeling bad about yourself?.
- No.</i>

897
01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:51.477
I've been kind of a pain lately.

898
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.980
<i>I said some things
I shouldn't have.</i>

899
01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.358
I really haven't been
too good this year.

900
01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.277
<i>- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it...</i>

901
01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.530
because I really like my family.

902
01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:05.157
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

903
01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:08.703
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

904
01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:13.290
I think so. How you feel about
your family is a complicated thing.

905
01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:16.877
Especially with an older brother.

906
01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:21.257
<i>Deep down you always love 'em.
but you can forget that you love 'em.</i>

907
01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:24.051
And you can hurt them.
and they can hurt you.

908
01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:27.888
And that's not just
because you're young.

909
01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:31.225
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

910
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.269
Sure.

911
01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:36.981
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

912
01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:42.737
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

913
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.657
- At church?
- Oh. you're always welcome at church.

914
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.160
I'm not welcome with my son.

915
01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:53.956
<i>Years back. before you and
your family moved on the block...</i>

916
01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.542
I had an argument with my son.

917
01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.921
- How old is he?
- Oh. he's grown up.

918
01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.632
We lost our tempers...

919
01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:06.719
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

920
01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:11.724
He said the same. and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

921
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.644
If you miss him.
why don't you call him?

922
01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:17.438
I'm afraid if I call him.
he won't talk to me.

923
01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.774
<i>How do you know?</i>

924
01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:22.860
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

925
01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.656
No offense. but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

926
01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:30.284
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

927
01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.620
You're never too old
to be afraid.

928
01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:35.498
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

929
01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:39.043
It's dark. there's weird stuff
down there. and it smells funny.

930
01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:42.546
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

931
01:20:42.672 --> 01:20:45.091
Basements are like that.

932
01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:48.094
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry...

933
01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.179
and I found out
it's not so bad.

934
01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.556
All this time
I've been worrying about it...

935
01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.934
but if you turn on the lights.
it's no big deal.

936
01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:59.480
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

937
01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.649
What if he won't talk to me?

938
01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:05.069
At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it...

939
01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:07.780
<i>and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.</i>

940
01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:11.450
I don't care how mad I was.
I'd talk to my dad...

941
01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:13.452
especially around the holidays.

942
01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:16.664
I don't know.

943
01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.959
<i>Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.</i>

944
01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:23.421
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

945
01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:25.381
I send her a check.

946
01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:29.802
I wish my grandparents sent that.
They always send me clothes.

947
01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.805
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

948
01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:36.183
- Oh. that's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

949
01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:39.228
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

950
01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:41.480
- Oh?
- Yeah.

951
01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:45.693
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there
was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

952
01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:49.071
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

953
01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:51.073
You think about what I said.

954
01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:52.950
<i>- All right?
- Okay.</i>

955
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:56.954
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

956
01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:06.172
- What about you?
- Me?

957
01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.257
Yeah. You and your son.

958
01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:11.677
We'll see what happens.

959
01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:14.722
Merry Christmas.

960
01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:16.724
Merry Christmas.

961
01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:13.489
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

962
01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:44.955
Okay. we'll check it out first.
We can always come back for the truck.

963
01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.839
How do you wanna go in?

964
01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:57.385
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in. You never know.

965
01:24:57.468 --> 01:25:00.930
Yeah. He's a kid.
Kids are stupid.

966
01:25:02.974 --> 01:25:06.894
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

967
01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:09.021
and the people
who sold it on sale.

968
01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:11.023
Amen.

969
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.758
This is it.
Don't get scared now.

970
01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:53.524
<i>Merry Christmas. little fella.</i>

971
01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.193
We know that you're in there...

972
01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:59.196
and that you're all alone.

973
01:25:59.322 --> 01:26:01.949
Yeah. come on. kid. Open up.

974
01:26:02.033 --> 01:26:05.578
It's Santa Claus and his elf.

975
01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:09.248
We're not gonna hurt you.

976
01:26:09.332 --> 01:26:13.294
No. no. We got
some nice presents for you.

977
01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:16.839
<i>Be a good little fella now
and open the door.</i>

978
01:26:19.759 --> 01:26:22.511
Shoot!

979
01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:26.390
What? What? What?

980
01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:29.518
What? What happened?

981
01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:33.189
Get that little--

982
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:44.700
Hello.

983
01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.500
Yes! Yes!

984
01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:54.669
The little jerk is armed!

You're dead. kid.

<i>Oh. no. I'm really scared!</i>

999
01:32:13.946 --> 01:32:16.574
It's too late for you. kid.
We're already in the house.

1000
01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:20.745
<i>- We're gonna get you!
- Okay. Come and get me.</i>

1001
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:23.414
Why. you--

- Marv!
- Harry?

1005
01:33:14.757 --> 01:33:16.759
Why the hell did
you take your shoes off?

1006
01:33:16.884 --> 01:33:20.012
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

I'm up here. you morons!
Come and get me!

<i>- Heads up!

01:33:43.327 --> 01:33:46.497
Don't worry. Marv. I'll get him for you.

1011
01:33:46.622 --> 01:33:50.126
Ow!

1012
01:33:50.251 --> 01:33:53.629
Yes!

1013
01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:00.511
He's only a kid. Harry.
We can take him.

1014
01:34:00.636 --> 01:34:02.596
- Aw. shut up. will ya!

1016
01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:10.021

<i>911 Emergency.</i>

1021
01:34:25.369 --> 01:34:28.122
Help. My house is being robbed.

1022
01:34:28.205 --> 01:34:32.793
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

1023
01:34:35.504 --> 01:34:38.049
Watch it. You never know
what's up there.

1024
01:34:38.174 --> 01:34:41.052
There he is!

1025
01:34:42.178 --> 01:34:45.306
Ah! I got ya!

Harry. I got him!

1027
01:34:48.851 --> 01:34:51.937
<i>Harry. get up! Give me a hand!</i>

1028
01:34:52.021 --> 01:34:56.192
<i>Ow! I got him!</i>

1029
01:34:56.317 --> 01:34:59.779
Harry. help me! Get up!

1030
01:34:59.904 --> 01:35:02.657
<i>I got him!</i>

1031
01:35:41.195 --> 01:35:46.033
- What are you doing. Marv?
- Harry. don't move.

1032
01:35:46.117 --> 01:35:50.079
- Marv?
- Don't... move!

1033
01:35:50.204 --> 01:35:53.499
<i>Marv. what are you doing?
Marv--</i>

1034
01:35:56.585 --> 01:36:00.172
Did I get him?
Did I get him?

1035
01:36:00.256 --> 01:36:02.591
Where is it?
Where is it?

1036
01:36:02.717 --> 01:36:05.886
Never mind did you get it!
How do you like it? Huh?

1037
01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:09.765
You jerk! Get that kid!
Go on! Get the kid!

1038
01:36:13.144 --> 01:36:16.564
Whoa! Whoa!

1039
01:36:16.647 --> 01:36:20.109
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

1040
01:36:20.234 --> 01:36:23.362
Whoa! Whoa!

1041
01:36:35.916 --> 01:36:38.044
Where'd he go?

1042
01:36:38.127 --> 01:36:40.171
Maybe he committed suicide.

1043
01:36:40.296 --> 01:36:42.423
<i>Down here.
you big horse's ass!</i>

1044
01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:45.468
Come and get me
before I call the police!

1045
01:36:45.593 --> 01:36:47.762
- Let's get him!
- Wait. Wait.

1046
01:36:47.845 --> 01:36:49.805
That's just what
he wants us to do--

1047
01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:53.392
us to go back downstairs through
his fun house so we get all tore up.

1048
01:36:53.517 --> 01:36:56.729
- He's gonna call the cops!
- He's not callin' the-- From a tree house?

1049
01:36:56.812 --> 01:36:58.731
Come on.

1050
01:36:58.814 --> 01:37:01.108
- Out the window?
- Yeah.

1051
01:37:01.192 --> 01:37:03.861
- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared. Marv?

1052
01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:06.572
Are you afraid?
Come on. Get out here.

1053
01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.079
Come on.

1054
01:37:16.666 --> 01:37:21.253
<i>Come on!</i>

1055
01:37:25.007 --> 01:37:27.551
Come on.
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

1056
01:37:27.677 --> 01:37:30.638
- Let's go back. Harry.
- Shut up!

1057
01:37:30.721 --> 01:37:33.975
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1058
01:37:34.058 --> 01:37:36.894
<i>Shut it. Marv!</i>

1059
01:37:39.355 --> 01:37:42.274
Hey. guys. check this out.

1060
01:37:42.358 --> 01:37:45.152
Go back! Go back!

1061
01:37:45.236 --> 01:37:46.737
- Go back.
- Okay.

1062
01:38:11.012 --> 01:38:15.975
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way. you dope!

1063
01:38:33.576 --> 01:38:38.331
- There he is!
- Hey. I'm calling the cops.

1064
01:38:38.414 --> 01:38:41.334
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
He wants us to follow him.

1065
01:38:41.417 --> 01:38:43.544
I got a better idea.
Come on.

1066
01:39:00.478 --> 01:39:04.815
Hiya. pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

1067
01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:07.902
Get over here!

1068
01:39:11.447 --> 01:39:13.449
What are we
gonna do to him. Harry?

1069
01:39:13.574 --> 01:39:17.953
We'll do exactly what he did to us.
I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

1070
01:39:18.079 --> 01:39:20.206
Then we can smash his face
with an iron!

1071
01:39:20.289 --> 01:39:24.210
<i>I'd like to slap him right in the face
with a paint can maybe.</i>

1072
01:39:24.293 --> 01:39:26.796
<i>Or shove a nail through his foot.</i>

1073
01:39:26.921 --> 01:39:30.174
I'm gonna bite off every one
of these little fingers one at a time.

1074
01:39:38.766 --> 01:39:42.103
Come on.
Let's get you home.

1075
01:40:03.833 --> 01:40:08.004
Wow. This is great.

1076
01:40:10.673 --> 01:40:13.509
Nice move-- always leaving
the water running.

1077
01:40:13.634 --> 01:40:16.846
Now we know each and
every house that you've hit.

1078
01:40:19.807 --> 01:40:23.477
Hey. you know. we've been looking
for you two guys for a long time.

1079
01:40:23.561 --> 01:40:26.522
- Yeah.
- Well. remember. we're the Wet Bandits.

1080
01:40:26.647 --> 01:40:30.776
- Wet Bandits. W-E-T--
- Shut up! Get in the car!

1081
01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:33.696
<i>Hey. come on. Come on.</i>

1082
01:40:33.821 --> 01:40:36.157
- Hands off the head. pal!
- Come on!

1083
01:41:31.879 --> 01:41:34.423
<i>I'm a bad parent.
I'm a bad parent.</i>

1084
01:41:34.548 --> 01:41:37.510
You're not. You know. you're beating
yourself up there. you know.

1085
01:41:37.593 --> 01:41:40.137
Come on. This happens.
These things happen. You know. you--

1086
01:41:40.262 --> 01:41:43.641
Gee. you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at-- Look at us.

1087
01:41:43.766 --> 01:41:48.187
I mean. we're on the road 48. 49 weeks
out of the year. We hardly see our families.

1088
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:51.649
Uh. Joe over there-- Gosh. you know. he--

1089
01:41:51.774 --> 01:41:54.485
<i>He forgets his kids' names
half the time.</i>

1090
01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:58.322
<i>Ziggy over there-- He doesn't even--
He's never even met his kid.</i>

1091
01:41:58.447 --> 01:42:02.118
<i>Eddie-- Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.</i>

1092
01:42:02.243 --> 01:42:07.081
Tell me. have you ever gone on vacation
and left your child home?

1093
01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:12.003
No.

1094
01:42:12.128 --> 01:42:15.548
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

1095
01:42:15.673 --> 01:42:17.883
Yeah. it was--
it was terrible too.

1096
01:42:17.967 --> 01:42:21.262
You know. I was all distraught and
everything. You know. the wife and I...

1097
01:42:21.387 --> 01:42:25.391
we left the little tyke
there in the funeral parlor all day.

1098
01:42:25.474 --> 01:42:29.395
All day. You know. and we went back
at night when we came to our senses.

1099
01:42:29.478 --> 01:42:32.982
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all day with a corpse.

1100
01:42:33.107 --> 01:42:35.735
- Oh!
- Whew. yeah. He was okay. you know.

1101
01:42:35.818 --> 01:42:40.740
After 6. 7 weeks. you know. he
came around and started talking again.

1102
01:42:40.823 --> 01:42:45.286
But he's okay. You know. they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

1103
01:42:45.369 --> 01:42:48.122
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well. you brought it up.

1104
01:42:48.205 --> 01:42:51.250
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Well. I'm sorry I did.

1105
01:43:17.151 --> 01:43:19.028
Mom?

1106
01:43:23.616 --> 01:43:25.493
Mom?

1107
01:43:28.913 --> 01:43:31.666
Mom?

1108
01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:21.465
Kevin? Kevin!

1109
01:44:52.455 --> 01:44:54.749
Merry Christmas. sweetheart.

1110
01:45:03.966 --> 01:45:06.677
Oh. Kevin. I'm so sorry.

1111
01:45:26.238 --> 01:45:28.366
Where is everybody else?

1112
01:45:28.491 --> 01:45:32.578
Oh. baby. they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much. but--

1113
01:45:32.662 --> 01:45:37.249
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the cab
and drool all over you. did I?

1114
01:45:37.333 --> 01:45:39.627
- I don't drool.
- You guys. would you shut up!

1115
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:43.047
Come on. you guys. it's Christmas.
Kevin! Kevin. Kevin. my boy!

1116
01:45:43.172 --> 01:45:45.049

Good to see you. Ah. you're all right.
I love you. You okay?

1119
01:45:50.012 --> 01:45:52.640
- Yeah.
- Hey. Kev.

1120
01:45:54.725 --> 01:45:58.312
It's pretty cool that
you didn't burn the place down.

1121
01:45:58.396 --> 01:46:02.191
<i>Thanks. Buzz.</i>

1122
01:46:02.316 --> 01:46:05.194
<i>Wait a minute.
How did you guys get home?</i>

1123
01:46:05.319 --> 01:46:08.656
Oh. we took the morning flight. Remember?
The one you didn't want to wait for.

1124
01:46:08.739 --> 01:46:11.409
Oh. no.
Oh. thank you.

1125
01:46:11.534 --> 01:46:13.452
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

1126
01:46:13.536 --> 01:46:16.093
Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

1127
01:46:16.119 --> 01:46:17.606
I went shopping yesterday.

1128
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:21.794
You? Shopping?

1129
01:46:21.877 --> 01:46:24.797
I got some milk. eggs
and fabric softener.

1130
01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:28.676
- What?
- No kiddin'?

1131
01:46:28.801 --> 01:46:32.888
What a funny guy. What else did
you do while we were away?

1132
01:46:33.014 --> 01:46:35.891
Just hung around.

1133
01:46:38.728 --> 01:46:40.855
<i>You guys.

1134
01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:44.817
You went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe. and he's going shopping?

1135
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.653
<i>- Buzz. forget it.

1136
01:47:11.093 --> 01:47:13.429
