2
00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:23.667
You should ask Jeffrey
for make-up tips.

3
00:01:23.793 --> 00:01:25.169
He's very talented.

4
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.744
Welcome.

5
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.329
Please have a seat.

6
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.998
I'm so sorry I'm late.

7
00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:10.170
This quarter's paperwork?

8
00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.881
Your shareholder proxy forms
and trust receipts.

9
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.926
The wire transfer will be
processed this evening.

10
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.719
Thank you.

11
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.099
So...

12
00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:24.184
The chairwoman is waiting.

13
00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:26.937
My grandmother?

14
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:33.402
- Grandmother.
- You haven't answered my texts.

15
00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.238
I've been busy with school.

16
00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.115
Aren't you done with school?

17
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.618
Lawyer Sun. give us a moment.

18
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.203
Of course.

19
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.755
Your student visa is expiring.
is it not?

20
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.965
It is.

21
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.718
But Lawyer Sun is arranging
an extension.

22
00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:01.012
There is no need
for an extension.

23
00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:04.141
We are acquiring KPMH.

24
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:08.061
a multinational corporation in
control of 15 fashion brands.

25
00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:11.648
They are looking
for a creative director.

26
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.859
- Grandmother.
- The board has already approved

27
00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:15.694
my recommendation.

28
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.280
You can now continue
the family tradition.

29
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.490
make use of your talents.

30
00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.659
and protect your grandfather's
legacy.

31
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.120
I have told you several times.

32
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.457
I don't want to work
for the company.

33
00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.208
You are not working
for the company.

34
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.793
You are the company.

35
00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:36.923
I've been too lenient after
your parents died.

36
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.887
I've given you seven years
to do whatever you want.

37
00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:45.640
Your grandfather has grown
impatient.

38
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.601
If you do not accept
this offer.

39
00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:51.188
he will force you to come back
to Korea.

40
00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.440
Do you understand?

41
00:28:38.592 --> 00:28:40.052
Tell me.

42
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:43.597
What am I supposed to say
at my PFLAG meeting tonight?

43
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.196
How are you. Grandmother?

44
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.407
You asked to see me.

45
00:29:01.532 --> 00:29:03.284
Are you in some kind
of trouble?

46
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:05.327
No. not at all!

47
00:29:07.288 --> 00:29:08.873
I just wanted to share
some news.

48
00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:11.959
I'm getting married.

49
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:13.294
Married?

50
00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:14.670
Yes.

51
00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:18.382
Her name is Angela Chen.

52
00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.385
Yes.

53
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.013
Who is her family?

54
00:29:24.138 --> 00:29:25.514
Her family?

55
00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.766
It's just her mother.

56
00:29:27.892 --> 00:29:31.061
They're not a famous family
or anything like that.

57
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:33.022
What does she do?

58
00:29:33.147 --> 00:29:34.648
She's a scientist.

59
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.567
She researches plastic eating
worms.

60
00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:38.736
Plastic eating worms?

61
00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:40.362
Yes. it's eco-friendly.

62
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.453
Are you sure she's not marrying
you for our money?

63
00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:49.163
Our money?

64
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:51.081
Well. in a sense...

65
00:29:51.207 --> 00:29:52.458
No. no.

66
00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:53.501
That's not it.

67
00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:55.127
- In what sense?
- It's nothing!

68
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:56.754
This is not about our money.

69
00:29:56.879 --> 00:29:58.631
We'll see about that.

70
00:29:58.756 --> 00:29:59.965
No!

71
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.592
What do you mean?

72
00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:04.762
I mean you can if you want.
of course.

73
00:30:04.887 --> 00:30:07.640
I'm just saying you don't need
to.

74
00:30:07.765 --> 00:30:09.266
She's not the kind of person.

75
00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.603
Gotta go.

76
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:15.184
What's come over you?

77
00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:16.810
It was a joke.

78
00:32:21.148 --> 00:32:24.026
Everything I do.
I do for you.

79
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.528
You know that.

80
00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:34.172
You must be very tired.

81
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:36.299
Wouldn't the company penthouse
be better?

82
00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:37.884
You'll be more comfortable
there.

83
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:39.135
No.

84
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.097
I will stay with you and Angela.

85
00:45:30.854 --> 00:45:33.690
Those are our tenants.

86
00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:36.734
They live in the guesthouse.

87
00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:14.397
The marriage license.

88
00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:15.565
I know.

89
00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:43.176
We'll get married this Friday...

90
00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:11.120
I am not an idiot.

91
00:47:12.622 --> 00:47:14.791
You want me to believe
you're sleeping with that woman?

92
00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:15.875
Ew. Grandmother!

93
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.211
What are you talking about?

94
00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:20.588
You know what I mean.

95
00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:23.550
We never had to talk about
this before.

96
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.010
What did you do?

97
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.929
What trouble have you caused?

98
00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:30.390
Or is she blackmailing you

99
00:47:30.515 --> 00:47:33.184
because she's discovered you're
gay and from a wealthy family?

100
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:34.477
What?

101
00:47:34.602 --> 00:47:36.646
No. Angela is gay. too!

102
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:39.566
Even worse.

103
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:41.359
A lesbian snake!

104
00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:26.154
What is this preposterous plan?

105
00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:27.905
Are you all stupid?

106
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.366
Or is life so boring

107
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:32.785
that you're determined to ruin
each other's lives?

108
00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:41.544
Your grandfather is expecting
a wedding.

109
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:45.256
Our relatives and our
acquaintances. as well.

110
00:48:47.008 --> 00:48:49.177
If only you had been honest
with me earlier--

111
00:48:49.302 --> 00:48:51.346
I can't be honest!

112
00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:55.975
You never gave me the chance.

113
00:49:00.355 --> 00:49:02.357
I am also to blame.

114
00:49:02.482 --> 00:49:03.816
I'll admit that.

115
00:49:05.777 --> 00:49:08.488
But I thought you...

116
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.907
would grow out of it.

117
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.412
I'll correct my mistake.

118
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:20.041
We must have a wedding.

119
00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:57.620
I will have Lawyer Sun invite
our employees here.

120
00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:00.498
We will take photos and publish
them in the newspapers.

121
00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:03.793
Your grandfather will believe it
if it's in the newspapers.

122
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:07.588
Your grandfather doesn't have
long to live.

123
00:50:08.464 --> 00:50:11.342
Neither do I.

124
00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:15.138
It will buy us all time.

125
00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:18.266
Do this for me

126
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:23.646
and I won't force you to join
the family business.

127
00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:32.071
Is that a promise?

128
00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:04.353
Why do they live in the house

129
00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:06.606
and you stay in a barn?

130
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.234
This is Lee's house.

131
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:29.796
I didn't mean for you to
find out like this.

132
00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:34.383
I wish I could have told you
some other way.

133
00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:38.095
This is not the future

134
00:51:38.221 --> 00:51:40.139
I wanted for you.

135
00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:45.478
But I can't make you
the grandson I wanted you to be.

136
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:55.905
Do you need anything?

137
00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:58.366
Can I get you some water?

138
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:45.866
This room could work for
the pyebaek ceremony.

139
00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:48.619
I agree.

140
00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:02.568
Do you not like the outfit?

141
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:05.154
Did you tell her?

142
00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:33.450
Angela's mother kept talking
about some meeting.

143
00:57:34.285 --> 00:57:36.245
Some club for parents?

144
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:39.206
Americans have a lot of clubs.

145
00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:43.377
She wants me to come with her.

146
00:57:43.502 --> 00:57:47.464
She says there's lots of talking
and laughing and crying.

147
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:53.137
Americans like to sit in circles
and laugh and cry.

148
00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:57.516
So.

149
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:59.643
she's not insane.

150
00:57:59.768 --> 00:58:02.104
Just American.

151
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:05.191
Yes. Just American.

152
00:58:09.695 --> 00:58:14.491
Angela's mother is very pleased
that her daughter is a lesbian.

153
00:58:16.202 --> 00:58:17.870
Yes.

154
00:58:24.877 --> 00:58:27.129
Your friend...

155
00:58:28.464 --> 00:58:31.592
Chris... Are his parents
pleased. also?

156
00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:38.599
Yes. I think so.

157
00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:42.186
Not as much as Angela's mother.

158
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:45.397
A normal amount of pleased.

159
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.070
Have you met them?

160
00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:54.281
Yes.

161
01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:41.743
Grandmother.
which ones are the sons

162
01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.161
and which ones are
the daughters?

163
01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:46.498
I forgot.

164
01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:48.542
Lawyer Sun.
which ones are the sons

165
01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:50.001
and which ones
are the daughters?

166
01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:52.629
I...

167
01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:55.215
don't remember either.

168
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.717
Does anybody else know?

169
01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.961
We're all done here today

170
01:10:56.086 --> 01:11:00.674
and arrangements are set
for city hall.

171
01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:26.843
Honey...

172
01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.595
It's okay.

173
01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:31.765
Everything's okay.

174
01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.559
It's okay.

175
01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.353
Tell Mama.

176
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:40.523
What happened?

177
01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.650
What happened?

178
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:14.849
Maybe you'll be worse than me.

179
01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:22.235
HYUN'S GRANDSON
MARRIES PRIVATELY IN SEATTLE

180
01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.696
Why did they take photos
of that?

181
01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:31.410
I remember everyone looked
so happy

182
01:20:31.536 --> 01:20:33.955
in cousin Woobin's wedding
photos.

183
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.832
They looked happy because
it was real.

184
01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:44.465
Grandmother.
how was your wedding?

185
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.842
Did you enjoy it?

186
01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:50.304
How could I have enjoyed it?

187
01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:53.516
I married someone
I didn't love...

188
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:56.852
like you.

189
01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:03.442
This is almost over.

190
01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:05.778
Get your marriage license.

191
01:21:05.903 --> 01:21:07.989
Lawyer Sun will take it
from there.

192
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:12.660
My stupid idea.

193
01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.122
This is all my fault.

194
01:21:20.126 --> 01:21:21.961
I'm sorry.

195
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:46.027
I have spent much time here
looking at your art.

196
01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:48.237
You...

197
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.658
bring these small individual
pieces together

198
01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:55.494
to create something meaningful

199
01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:57.997
and beautiful.

200
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.628
I see that you have done this
with your own life.

201
01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:08.215
I don't understand.

202
01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:15.056
You were different from
a very early age.

203
01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:18.017
I sensed it.

204
01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:21.354
After your parents died.

205
01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:25.107
I tried my best to protect you
from your grandfather.

206
01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:30.821
I sent you away.

207
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:40.998
I was only trying to protect you
with money.

208
01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:46.879
I never realized what you truly
needed was a family.

209
01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.965
But here.

210
01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.926
by yourself

211
01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.303
you created your own family.

212
01:22:55.096 --> 01:22:57.556
Just like your art.

213
01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:02.061
A family that you care
for deeply

214
01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:05.481
and that cares for you.

215
01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:21.247
I hope someday you can do what
you want. because I couldn't.

216
01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:28.087
I hope you can love who
you want. because I couldn't.

217
01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:32.341
This is my wedding gift to you.

218
01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:44.270
No matter what anyone says.
you are my grandson.

219
01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.278
Thank you.
