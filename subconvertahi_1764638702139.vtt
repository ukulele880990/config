-Years of notes in here.
-What's that?

4
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.137
[Lester] It's nothing. But if a man
comes in with a white gardenia.

Accidental death?

-You're the cuckoo chick!
-Cuckoo what?

10

Lester likened all the tenants to birds.

Why does the shrimp you're holding

13
00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:28.489
It looks like there's some sort
of green fungus on the nail.

14
00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:32.243
You've heard about my family's ties
to criminal activity.

15
00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:34.579
Can you explain what you meant
when you said

16
00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:38.416
<i>that your missing husband</i>

How many guests are we expecting?

19
00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:47.175
Just Althea. Tim.
and a few friends from Bayport.

20
00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:49.969
Nicky used to carry these decks
around everywhere he went.

<i>"In gambling. the many must lose</i>

28

29

<i>He also said some pro-Stalin things.</i>

30
00:01:14.243 --> 00:01:17.371

<i>which isn't relevant here.</i>

<i>-Mabel. can we cut that?</i>
-[Mabel] <i>No.</i>

32

[Charles]
<i>Okay. great.</i>

33
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:23.836
<i>At the onset of the 1910s.</i>
<i>the rise of the automobile</i>

34
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.924
<i>rendered the horse stables</i>
<i>under the Arconia obsolete.</i>

35
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.886
<i>It wasn't long before some</i>
<i>of New York's most infamous mobsters</i>

36
00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.807
<i>found a new. more lucrative use</i>
<i>for the space.</i>

37
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.060
<i>By the 1920s. the mob</i>
<i>had secret gaming rooms</i>

38

<i>all over the city.</i>

39
00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:43.022
<i>and none played host</i>
<i>to more power players</i>

40
00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:44.524
<i>than the Velvet Room.</i>

41
00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:45.733
<i>For over a century.</i>

42
00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:50.071
<i>some of the most consequential decisions</i>
<i>in the city were made here.</i>

43

<i>Rumor has it.</i>

44
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.325
<i>this is where the Empire State Building</i>
<i>contract was awarded.</i>

45
00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:58.162
<i>where it was decided that bars</i>
<i>could stay open until 4:00 a.m..</i>

46
00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.289
<i>and where. at the last second.</i>

47
00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:02.875
<i>it was changed</i>
<i>from "Zachary Taylor Island."</i>

48
00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.877
<i>to "Roosevelt Island."</i>

49
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:08.965
<i>Even as the fashion. decor.</i>
<i>and clientele changed over the years.</i>

50
00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:12.635
<i>one constant remained: the mob.</i>

51
00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:16.931
<i>Everyone from Lucky Luciano</i>
<i>to John Gotti wielded power</i>

52

55
00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:28.109
I always assumed
the Velvet Room was a myth.

56
00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:29.652
but it was right here all along.

57
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:31.612
How did I miss it?

58
00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:34.282
Well. to be fair.
it was down a secret staircase

59
00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:36.659
that only opened
with a magic deck of cards.

60
00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:39.370
I wouldn't beat yourself up too much.

61
00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:43.416
You know. this does make for a good
opening twist of our podcast.

62

Can you keep him there?

70

Shouldn't be too hard.

comparing people to birds.

might be back.

677
00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:42.885
And it-- it-- it just went horribly wrong.
People rioted.

678
00:30:42.969 --> 00:30:45.388
And it definitely didn't have anything
to do with the script.

679
00:30:45.471 --> 00:30:48.516
-Hmm.
-So. I sat her down.

680
00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:53.354
and I told her. "Sheena-baneena.
stop trying to be Chuck

681
00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:58.276
and start trying to be filet mignon."
[snort-chuckling]

682
00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:00.736
And from then on.
the rest is history.

683
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.030
So. the musical was a success?

684
00:31:03.114 --> 00:31:04.115
I said it was history.

685
00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:06.659
Point is. it's hard to follow a legend.

686
00:31:06.742 --> 00:31:09.036
so stop trying to be Lester.

687
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.330
You can't be somebody you're not.

688
00:31:11.414 --> 00:31:13.749
I still have a lot of follow-up questions
about this musical.

689
00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:15.877
but I think I get
what you're trying to say.

690
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.795
Thank you. Mr. Putnam.

691
00:31:17.879 --> 00:31:20.131
And I don't care what you say.
you're a good guy.

692
00:31:20.214 --> 00:31:23.342
Ah. well. thank you.

693
00:31:23.426 --> 00:31:27.889
And. um. I know
this might be hard to believe.

694
00:31:27.972 --> 00:31:30.808
given my boyish good looks.
but. uh.

695
00:31:30.892 --> 00:31:33.686
I've actually lived
in this building quite a while.

696
00:31:34.729 --> 00:31:37.231
So. if you wanted. I could try
and help you

697
00:31:37.315 --> 00:31:38.816
finish some of that training.

698
00:31:40.234 --> 00:31:41.527
-Really?
-Yes.

699
00:31:41.611 --> 00:31:44.196
A-Any question you have.
please come to me.

700
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.658
Uh. I actually have a bunch of questions.
Can we start right now?

701
00:31:47.742 --> 00:31:50.870
No. Right now. I have to take
a very important nap.

702
00:31:50.953 --> 00:31:54.916
But. I would say any other time.

703
00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:56.918
I promise. I'm there for ya.

704
00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:00.963

Heir of the Pflug pharma family.

760
00:34:46.128 --> 00:34:47.588
Oh. they make highly addictive drugs

761
00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:49.215
that ruined a lot of people's lives.

762
00:34:49.298 --> 00:34:52.301
They also make my blood pressure
medication. so I'm conflicted.

763
00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:54.261
This is Camila White.

764
00:34:54.345 --> 00:34:57.056
She owns half of New York's hotels.

765
00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.934
And God. can she rock
a neutral cashmere.
