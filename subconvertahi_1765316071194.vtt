00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.694
Murphy. join the party. huh?

3
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.574
What's wrong?

4
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.768
All you guys having a good time?

5
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:46.437
You gotta let it go. man.
There's good that came out of this.

6
00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.406
Yeah. we used him.
then we got him killed.

7
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.247
No. we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

8
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.719
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

9
00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.023
Look on the bright side. huh?

10
00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.926
<i>Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.</i>

11
00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.430
<i>One of the</i> sicarios <i>caught</i>
<i>after Lara Bonilla's assassination</i>

12
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.867
<i>confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.</i>

13
00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.235
<i>An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.</i>

14
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.913
<i>Finally. the Colombian government
had to react.</i>

15
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.042
<i>Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.</i>

16
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:25.949
PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100.000 REWARD

17
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:31.218
<i>Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.</i>

18
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.959
<i>Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America</i>

19
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.462
<i>could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US.</i>

20
00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.067
<i>even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.</i>

21
00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.399
<i>This made all the difference in the world.</i>

22
00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.405
<i>If you were a narco in Colombia.</i>

23
00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.305
<i>jail time meant banging girls.
watching movies.</i>

24
00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.102
<i>hanging with the fellas...</i>

25
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.171
<i>Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.</i>

26
00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.113
<i>It was a fucking joke.</i>

27
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.684
<i>Back home.
it was a whole different deal.</i>

28
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.587
<i>The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.</i>

29
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.957
<i>You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day.
just like every other loser.</i>

30
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.586
<i>a fucking nightmare.</i>

31
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.494
<i>Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.</i>

32
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:48.227
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

33
00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.854
- With our help. you will.
- Oh. that's right.

34
00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.432
Gringos to the rescue.

35
00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.262
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

36
00:03:56.503 --> 00:04:00.804
One man with helicopters. airplanes.
vehicles. planned escape routes.

37
00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.714
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money.

38
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.141
- men. weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

39
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.280
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

40
00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.777
Help us catch him.

41
00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:16.890
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

42
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.549
Let me take care of that.

43
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.494
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

44
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.097
Escobar will not go lightly.

45
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.568
He will make Colombia bleed.

46
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.175
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

47
00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.844
You make the mistakes.
and then you preach solidarity?

48
00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:51.288
- Shut up. fag.
- What the fuck. Carlos?

49
00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.452
Why are you always defending him?

50
00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.496
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

51
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.360
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

52
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.337
Gentlemen...

53
00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.476
I suggest we form another organization

54
00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:14.980
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

55
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.277
Like John Lennon said.

56
00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:20.817
- "Come together. brothers and sisters..."
- Stop that fag shit right now.

57
00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.017
So Jorge...

58
00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.152
what will we call it?

59
00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:30.489
<i>First. "Death to Kidnappers."
then "the Extraditables."</i>

60
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.896
<i>Once again. the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.</i>

61
00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:39.632
<i>But it was not quite like
"one for all. and all for one."</i>

62
00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.373
<i>It was more like each man for himself.</i>

63
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.877
Next!

64
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:50.074
<i>Gacha. being Gacha. decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition</i>

65
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.219
<i>- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.</i>
- Fire!

66
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.552
<i>So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.</i>

67
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.691
Next!

68
00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:02.423
<i>Lehder. being Lehder. got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.</i>

69
00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.894
The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

70
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.361
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

71
00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.573
<i>I'm not sure how helpful that was.</i>

72
00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.505
I mean. all of our problems...

73
00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:19.873
are because of those imperialist gringos!

74
00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.514
No. stay there... stay there.

75
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:26.553
<i>As for the Ochoa brothers.
they went with a fancy PR firm</i>

76
00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:30.181
<i>and got ripped off because. well...
that's what PR agencies do.</i>

77
00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.392
"Better a grave in Colombia

78
00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.926
than a grave in the United States."

79
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.963
No. I've got it. Fabio. I've got it.
Let's see...

80
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:42.601
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

81
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.136
- What do you think?
- I love it.

82
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.570
Very good.

83
00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:50.075
And for $50.000 more.
we'll make your logo.

84
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.142
Done.

85
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.245
<i>By the way.
here's the logo $50.000 got you.</i>

86
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:01.981
<i>In the upcoming presidential election.
extradition became the defining issue</i>

87
00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:03.420
<i>amongst the candidates.</i>

88
00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:06.083
<i>Those the narcos could buy.
they bought.</i>

89
00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:08.386
<i>The ones they could scare.
they scared.</i>

90
00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:11.325
<i>But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.</i>

91
00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:15.433
<i>And so. unable to buy him
and unable to scare him.</i>

92
00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:18.733
<i>Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery.</i>

93
00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.739
<i>and he wrote Galán a letter.</i>

94
00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:26.511
"And to conclude. I want
to express my most energetic protest

95
00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:29.309
over the improper interference
of North America

96
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.283
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

97
00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.411
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

98
00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.119
He's got some balls.

99
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:38.916
Escobar is shameless.

100
00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:43.588
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency. Mr. Galán.

101
00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:46.690
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States.

102
00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.667
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

103
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.637
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

104
00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:55.603
My campaign manager.
Dr. Gaviria.

105
00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:58.144
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

106
00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:02.209
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle.

107
00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:05.012
when clearly.
they're losing a war.

108
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.046
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

109
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.449
If you speak in favor
of extradition. you will be their puppet.

110
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.859
and that will be your death sentence.

111
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:20.195
I don't care about the Americans. but I am
still going to support extradition.

112
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.573
Besides. if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country.

113
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.968
then let them take them.

114
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.591
<i>Since he couldn't get to Galán.</i>

115
00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:29.368
<i>Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.</i>

116
00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:32.306
<i>He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm</i>

117
00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.506
<i>if no judge was willing to apply it.</i>

118
00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:39.178
<i>"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons</i>

119
00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:42.517
<i>and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States.</i>

120
00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:45.990
<i>know we. the Extraditables.
will pass judgment on you</i>

121
00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:48.652
<i>and bring a sentence far harsher."</i>

122
00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:51.027
<i>The judges were so scared and intimidated</i>

123
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.862
<i>that special court procedures
had to be created.</i>

124
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.402
<i>For the first time
in the history of Colombia.</i>

125
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.370
<i>it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.</i>

126
00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:01.199
Defendants. please rise.

127
00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:06.743
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

128
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:13.750
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

129
00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:17.187
<i>Despite his threats.
many brave men defied him.</i>

130
00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:22.792
<i>And true to form.
when the pen failed...</i>

131
00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.898
<i>Pablo was always ready with the sword.</i>

132
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.904
<i>In light of this terrorism.
you'd think that everyone in Colombia</i>

133
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:37.808
<i>would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority. right?</i>

134
00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.310
<i>Well. guess again.</i>

135
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:43.277
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

136
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.978
All due respect. but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

137
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.781
We got FARC. we got M-19.
we got EPL. we got ELN.

138
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.416
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

139
00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:57.258
Sorry. Agent Peña. but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems.

140
00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.628
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

141
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.636
<i>Communists. Remember them?</i>

142
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:08.135
<i>With Reagan in the White House.
it was hard to forget.</i>

143
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.274
<i>In his words:</i>

144
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:12.479
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

145
00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.843
<i>The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing. always had been.</i>

146
00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:20.485
<i>In Hollywood. he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.</i>

147
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.590
<i>In Washington.
he created the Reagan Doctrine.</i>

148
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.319
<i>which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.</i>

149
00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.861
<i>Drug traffickers just didn't rate.</i>

150
00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:33.524
<i>You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world.</i>

151
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:34.826
<i>you'd better be chasing reds.</i>

152
00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:38.368
Ambassador. if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets.

153
00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:40.440
the Colombians will get Escobar.

154
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.533
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

155
00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:46.271
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

156
00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:51.443
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

157
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.783
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker. and as such.

158
00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:59.826
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

159
00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:05.055
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

160
00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:06.791
Let the Colombians get him.

161
00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:10.969
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100.000

162
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.199
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah. it's a fucking joke.

163
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.152
That's about what he spends on shoes.
isn't it?

164
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.203
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

165
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.711
So what do we do now?

166
00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.316
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

167
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.976
<i>It's true.
the hundred grand wasn't that much.</i>

168
00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:30.818
<i>But delivered into the right hands.
it could make a difference.</i>

169
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.653
<i>There were a lot of good cops in Colombia.
honorable men.</i>

170
00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:40.598
<i>But the head of counternarcotics.
General Jaramillo. wasn't one of 'em.</i>

171
00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:45.829
<i>And as such.
he was exactly what we needed.</i>

172
00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.574
Thank you for seeing me. General.

173
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.267
You're welcome.

174
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.938
Listen. I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

175
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.415
With all due respect. General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

176
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.680
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

177
00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:03.586
Well. I don't want him to follow.

178
00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:06.085
I want him to lead.

179
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.232
Go ahead.

180
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.399
Yes. General.

181
00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.596
As you wish.

182
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.865
Understood.

183
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.068
What happened. honey?

184
00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:26.942
Things with work.

185
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.242
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

186
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:33.218
I'm making the chicken he likes.
but he's out with the girlfriend.

187
00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:38.291
Tell me what's wrong.

188
00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:41.221
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

189
00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:47.624
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

190
00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.631
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man.

191
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.400
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

192
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.499
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

193
00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:58.604
Hm.

194
00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:03.105
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back. well. then...

195
00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:05.117
I didn't hear them complaining. did I?

196
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:07.847
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

197
00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.786
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

198
00:13:11.024 --> 00:13:14.688
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police. you know?

199
00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:16.187
And most of all. to the top brass.

200
00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:19.026
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

201
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.189
Mm.

202
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.171
Oh. shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

203
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:28.966
Egrets from the Himalayas.

204
00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.544
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

205
00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.712
They cost me a million dollars.

206
00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.984
Bastards.

207
00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.690
Stay in the fucking tree!

208
00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.302
Seems like you lost that dough.
eh. cousin?

209
00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.467
That's your problem. Pablo.

210
00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:07.046
You think that everything
can be controlled.

211
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.649
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

212
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:15.552
OK. OK. OK. Gustavo... OK.

213
00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:19.916
Your English is really good.

214
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:23.154
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

215
00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:24.864
How long you been at the <i>comuna?</i>

216
00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:27.033
Just a few weeks.

217
00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:29.659
Is your husband
gonna help us here. too?

218
00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:33.069
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

219
00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:37.903
Oh. he's. uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

220
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.117
- I fucked up.
- How?

221
00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.892
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

222
00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.956
No. Jaramillo's sending a message.

223
00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.723
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

224
00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:57.353
He's setting Carrillo up for failure.
and when he does fail.

225
00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.761
he'll fire him for incompetence.

226
00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.629
and me and you.
we lose the only cop we can trust.

227
00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:05.532
- Hey!
- Hey!

228
00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.300
- Sorry I'm late. honey.
- Mm...

229
00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:10.875
Javier. this is my friend. Elisa.

230
00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:12.777
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

231
00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:13.869
Nice to meet you.

232
00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.384
Are you another... janitor at the embassy.
like Steve?

233
00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:20.544
No. actually. I'm CIA.

234
00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:24.053
But that's classified.
so don't tell anybody.

235
00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:27.650
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

236
00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:30.457
- The janitor thing. what. that was you?
- Mm.

237
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.724
No. it's just a cover.

238
00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:35.233
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

239
00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:38.270
Just so you know.
I'm a communist <i>guerrillera.</i>

240
00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:41.565
Perfect.

241
00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:44.328
<i>If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...</i>

242
00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.842
<i>we probably wouldn't have cared.</i>

243
00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.244
<i>We cared about Pablo Escobar.</i>

244
00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:52.409
<i>And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.</i>

245
00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.511
<i>He had better resources
and better information.</i>

246
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.087
<i>And at the time.</i>
<i>he owned over 800 homes and</i> fincas.

247
00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:01.158
<i>surrounded by dozens of</i> sicarios
<i>willing to die for him.</i>

248
00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:04.831
<i>And cops...
he owned a lot of them. too.</i>

249
00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:06.088
<i>But not all of them.</i>

250
00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:10.633
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his <i>finca</i> called <i>El Bizcocho</i> tomorrow.

251
00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.262
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

252
00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.603
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

253
00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:19.312
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

254
00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:23.944
Trapped a little bird.

255
00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.643
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

256
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.920
Jesus.

257
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.688
Just remember that you wanted all in.

258
00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.795
Hand me that coffee.

259
00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:53.035
He already gave up
the name of three <i>fincas.</i>

260
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.375
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

261
00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.509
But you do know
where he is hiding. don't you?

262
00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:22.601
Look. little brother.

263
00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.940
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

264
00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.878
But I will also kill you.

265
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.048
And very slowly.

266
00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:36.245
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

267
00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:40.950
Well. then. you should pray we find him.
and quickly.

268
00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:46.862
<i>We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out.</i>

269
00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.467
<i>but there was a small part of me
that thought. in his arrogance.</i>

270
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.705
<i>he would stand and fight.</i>

271
00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:55.240
<i>Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.</i>

272
00:17:55.341 --> 00:17:57.207
Boss!

273
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.310
Poison...

274
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.640
Boss!

275
00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:03.917
They were headed for El Bizcocho.
but they got off the main highway.

276
00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:06.747
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

277
00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:08.079
Two hours. boss.

278
00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.621
Round up the guys.
and tell them to get ready.

279
00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.623
- We're leaving.
- All right.

280
00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.731
We have to go.

281
00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:20.997
Go where?

282
00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.795
The police are coming.

283
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.247
- But Pablo. I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry. my love.

284
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:29.106
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

285
00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.074
We'll buy new ones later.
won't we?

286
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.173
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:39.011
Do you hear me complaining?

288
00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:47.090
As long as you're with us. Pablo.
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

289
00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.101
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- Yes. sir.

290
00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:00.503
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

291
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.769
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

292
00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:05.139
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

293
00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:07.679
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

294
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.311
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

295
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.048
Yes. sir!

296
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.970
What's wrong. Gustavo?

297
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.401
You fucked us. Pablo.

298
00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:42.048
Not only you and me.

299
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.740
You fucked the whole family.

300
00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:51.485
But of course. since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

301
00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:56.222
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country.

302
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.661
the rest of us get screwed.
isn't that right?

303
00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.330
But what the fuck...

304
00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:10.172
a man only dies once. right?

305
00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.543
Come here.

306
00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:22.719
My brother.

307
00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:26.376
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on. come on.

308
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.525
There we go.

309
00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:43.640
<i>I like to think
that as Pablo looked down</i>

310
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.208
<i>on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time.</i>

311
00:20:46.312 --> 00:20:50.647
<i>he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.</i>

312
00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:54.811
<i>You may have 800 houses. my friend.
but none of them is home.</i>

313
00:20:54.954 --> 00:20:57.981
<i>We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life.</i>

314
00:20:58.124 --> 00:21:01.060
<i>or until we catch you...
or kill you.</i>

315
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.629
<i>From now on. nowhere is safe.</i>

316
00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.160
<i>The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners</i>

317
00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:27.483
<i>while we searched the</i> finca
<i>from top to bottom.</i>

318
00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:32.785
<i>The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.</i>

319
00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:37.588
<i>Hey. if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out. too.</i>

320
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.600
<i>There's an old saying in law enforcement:</i>

321
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.465
<i>"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.</i>

322
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.039
<i>The good guys
just need to get lucky once."</i>

323
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:53.204
<i>And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit.
I got very lucky.</i>

324
00:21:53.913 --> 00:21:58.009
<i>The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.</i>

325
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.847
<i>We raided it.
and guess who we found?</i>

326
00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.114
<i>Blackbeard.</i>

327
00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:06.556
<i>Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.</i>

328
00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:10.155
<i>In custody.
he would describe a cocaine empire</i>

329
00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:14.063
<i>that was bringing in $60 million a day.</i>

330
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.965
<i>Pablo was bigger than General Motors.</i>

331
00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:21.370
<i>The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice.</i>

332
00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:23.669
<i>home of Colombia's supreme court.</i>

333
00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:26.302
<i>the only place
thought safe enough to store it.</i>

334
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.079
<i>We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.</i>

335
00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:33.550
Fuck.

336
00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:37.350
Fuck.

337
00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.482
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

338
00:22:39.592 --> 00:22:41.720
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

339
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:44.160
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

340
00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:46.441
Javi. there's some good stuff in here.
stuff we can use.

341
00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:48.593
None of it can leave the room.

342
00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:51.497
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

343
00:22:51.604 --> 00:22:54.403
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

344
00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:57.176
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

345
00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:04.376
Take 'em.

346
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.548
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

347
00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:10.589
What are you talking about?

348
00:23:10.723 --> 00:23:13.124
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

349
00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:18.960
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

350
00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:21.533
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

351
00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:23.296
They're not gonna
search a white boy. OK?

352
00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:25.635
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

353
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:26.795
Just do it.

354
00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:31.436
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

355
00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.618
<i>- And sometimes. bad people...
- Señor.</i>

356
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.909
<i>Help you do good things.</i>

357
00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:39.544
These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

358
00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:43.646
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

359
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.291
Yes.

360
00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:51.321
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

361
00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:52.931
Obviously. it's an alias.

362
00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:56.935
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

363
00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:59.267
Because he's not Colombian.

364
00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:04.842
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

365
00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:06.673
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

366
00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:10.845
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

367
00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:15.478
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

368
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.615
Suarez. do you ever worry
what will happen to you

369
00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:23.992
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

370
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.693
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

371
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:31.426
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

372
00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:37.299
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

373
00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:41.278
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

374
00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:49.712
Wha... What the fuck is this?

375
00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.448
This is me giving you homework.

376
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.886
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

377
00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.718
And I need you to find out who it is.

378
00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:58.692
First off. I don't fucking work for you.
Murphy. you hear me?

379
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:01.665
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

380
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.204
What's he up to these days?

381
00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.567
Barry Seal.

382
00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:17.980
<i>Barry Seal. a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football.</i>

383
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.712
<i>mind-altering chemicals.
and pussy...</i>

384
00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:23.354
<i>which made him perfect CIA material.</i>

385
00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:27.654
<i>But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.</i>

386
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.426
<i>Finding Barry was easy.</i>

387
00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:33.589
<i>We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.</i>

388
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.165
<i>It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite. too.</i>

389
00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:39.068
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

390
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.233
No. I'm serious.

391
00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.607
Look.

392
00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:47.907
Oh. my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

393
00:25:48.147 --> 00:25:49.445
Until next time.

394
00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:55.946
- Goddamn. is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

395
00:25:57.256 --> 00:25:59.452
Come on. we got you a ride
waiting over here.

396
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:01.219
Hi. Vanessa.

397
00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:04.924
It's fun to say. though.
ain't it? "McPickle"?

398
00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:11.363
Have a seat. Barry.

399
00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:20.070
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

400
00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:22.876
Well. you guys ain't got shit.

401
00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:27.715
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

402
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.789
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

403
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:34.587
Yeah? Well. let's see
if that holds up in court. huh?

404
00:26:34.827 --> 00:26:38.389
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

405
00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:40.159
without making a refueling stop.

406
00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:43.596
Yeah. according to the records.
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

407
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.233
The manifests don't lie.

408
00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:50.434
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine.

409
00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:54.172
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department. wouldn't it?

410
00:26:54.313 --> 00:26:58.148
Well. damn...
you guys are good.

411
00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.581
Communist sympathizer.

412
00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:01.654
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big. red bow

413
00:27:01.887 --> 00:27:03.607
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

414
00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:06.135
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments.

415
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.751
that's treason and trafficking.

416
00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:11.190
What's that.
two life sentences for the price of one?

417
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:13.424
That's right.

418
00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:20.529
Well... see.
I figured this day might come.

419
00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:23.674
Why don't you uncuff me. boys.
I got something to show you.

420
00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:24.868
Yeah? What's that?

421
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.673
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

422
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:31.147
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on. uncuff me.

423
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.719
<i>What Barry had was a picture of Escobar</i>

424
00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:37.789
<i>loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?</i>

425
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.884
<i>'Cause at the time. Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas.</i>

426
00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.792
<i>who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip</i>

427
00:27:44.897 --> 00:27:47.560
<i>for cocaine shipments to the US.</i>

428
00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.693
<i>Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?</i>

429
00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:53.135
<i>I couldn't have made that up.</i>

430
00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.118
- Holy shit.
<i>- It was too good.</i>

431
00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:57.972
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait. wait. wait. No.

432
00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:00.807
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

433
00:28:00.913 --> 00:28:04.350
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

434
00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.577
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

435
00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:10.155
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

436
00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:12.486
- You know. I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

437
00:28:12.591 --> 00:28:16.050
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

438
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.702
<i>I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants.</i>

439
00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:31.868
<i>but frankly.
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.</i>

440
00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:33.843
<i>He was just another busted trafficker</i>

441
00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:37.508
<i>who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.</i>

442
00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:41.215
<i>If I could use
the narco-communist connection</i>

443
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.449
<i>to get the resources we needed.
then fuck him.</i>

444
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.885
Strange bedfellows. indeed.

445
00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:50.724
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

446
00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:52.898
Washington is gonna go crazy.

447
00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.393
Thank you. Ambassador.

448
00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:59.804
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

449
00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.031
Of course.

450
00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.408
Thank you.

451
00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:11.307
<i>In Washington. "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.</i>

452
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:15.418
<i>Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.</i>

453
00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:18.419
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

454
00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:22.927
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

455
00:29:23.028 --> 00:29:26.157
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

456
00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:29.496
This picture shows Federico Vaughan.

457
00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:33.436
a top aide to one of the nine <i>comandantes</i>
who rule Nicaragua.

458
00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:38.476
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

459
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:43.776
No. there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

460
00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:47.111
<i>Being a rat is a dangerous business.</i>

461
00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:49.313
<i>and Escobar's reach was long.</i>

462
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.014
<i>Barry Seal refused federal protection...</i>

463
00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:57.253
<i>and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.</i>

464
00:29:57.496 --> 00:29:58.759
<i>Whoops.</i>

465
00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:08.263
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

466
00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:11.468
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña. if he wanted a long life.

467
00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:14.307
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

468
00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.141
I didn't kill him. Escobar did.

469
00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:20.450
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

470
00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.680
Look on the bright side. man.

471
00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.649
<i>From then on. according to Reagan.</i>

472
00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:30.195
<i>fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.</i>

473
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:33.891
<i>We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.</i>

474
00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.968
<i>The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:</i>

475
00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:41.469
<i>planes. helicopters.
you fucking name it. Everything.</i>

476
00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:50.679
<i>Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country</i>

477
00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:55.311
<i>and burn 'em straight to the ground.
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.</i>

478
00:30:55.554 --> 00:30:58.422
<i>We were kicking ass.
and the narcos were feeling it.</i>

479
00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.989
<i>The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.</i>

480
00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:06.358
<i>Despite all this. we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...</i>

481
00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:10.163
<i>till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether.</i>

482
00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:12.213
<i>the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.</i>

483
00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:13.237
Got it!

484
00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:17.370
<i>The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia.</i>

485
00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.909
<i>Medellín's biggest processing lab.
and we hit it hard.</i>

486
00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:24.344
<i>The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...</i>

487
00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.180
<i>but in the end.
it got us our biggest victory to date.</i>

488
00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:31.552
<i>the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.</i>

489
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.726
In my tent is a bag with $50.000...

490
00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.795
ten times this if you give me one hour.

491
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:41.295
There's no way out.
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

492
00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.433
<i>Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States.</i>

493
00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:52.977
<i>where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.</i>

494
00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:58.216
<i>Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.</i>

495
00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.313
<i>And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.</i>

496
00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:06.755
<i>For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán.</i>

497
00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:11.091
<i>it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.</i>

498
00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:13.495
<i>Extradition would become his battle cry.</i>

499
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.495
Gentlemen?

500
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:18.567
Thank you.

501
00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:23.639
<i>And for the narcos.
this was a declaration of war.</i>

502
00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:27.836
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

503
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:32.141
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

504
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:35.914
against the legality of extradition.

505
00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:40.925
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

506
00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:43.586
Can we buy someone in that court?

507
00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.756
Unfortunately. no.

508
00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:50.302
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

509
00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:54.373
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

510
00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:57.271
Brother... even after he's dead.

511
00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:00.707
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

512
00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:02.712
He's totally fucked.

513
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.449
This is gringo bullshit.

514
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:08.316
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

515
00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.647
We're next. aren't we?

516
00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:12.721
You're right.

517
00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:14.724
Pablito?

518
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.328
Do you have an answer or what?

519
00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:25.962
Well... in my opinion. a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

520
00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:30.197
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

521
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.868
Carlos was one of us.

522
00:33:34.613 --> 00:33:39.745
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

523
00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.178
But remember.
there's something they want more than us.

524
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.315
So. brothers...

525
00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:48.505
it's time to give them what they want.
isn't it?

526
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:53.254
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

527
00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:56.664
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

528
00:33:56.768 --> 00:34:01.103
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

529
00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:06.507
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

530
00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:10.280
Two million US dollars.

531
00:34:11.316 --> 00:34:13.012
It's very dangerous.

532
00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:17.950
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

533
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.893
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous. right?

534
00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.637
But for us. brother...

535
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:40.242
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

536
00:34:41.613 --> 00:34:44.947
We have a historical obligation.

537
00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:48.919
We can't forget that.

538
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.613
I'm his girlfriend.

539
00:34:58.263 --> 00:34:59.788
Meet Pablo Escobar.

540
00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:03.897
Miss.

541
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.632
- OK.
- We have a deal.

542
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.137
All right. then.

543
00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:11.408
We were just leaving.

544
00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:12.807
Good night.

545
00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:22.450
What the hell is this?

546
00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:24.648
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

547
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:28.453
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

548
00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:31.257
In exchange for what?

549
00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:35.866
Unless you are willing to be part of it.
I cannot say.

550
00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:42.964
It's a partnership.
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

551
00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:47.444
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

552
00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:04.360
Connie?

553
00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.294
Elisa? What's going on?

554
00:36:07.232 --> 00:36:08.709
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

555
00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.702
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

556
00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:11.996
Yeah.

557
00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:13.877
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

558
00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:15.133
About what?

559
00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:19.310
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

560
00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:21.522
I don't know what it is.
but I know it's gonna be bad.

561
00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:24.516
Wait. Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

562
00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:28.151
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

563
00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:29.687
and you need to hide me.

564
00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:32.581
OK. Come on.

565
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:39.096
Steve's already at work.
but Javi lives downstairs.

566
00:36:47.806 --> 00:36:49.434
I just hope he's here.

567
00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:50.940
I am.

568
00:36:52.277 --> 00:36:54.508
- Well. what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

569
00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.080
I'll be right back. Go.

570
00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.863
- <i>She told me that Escobar...</i>
- Slow down.

571
00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.887
<i>Hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.</i>

572
00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:08.223
- Slow down.
<i>- Escobar is using members of M-19.</i>

573
00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.727
- Say that again?
<i>- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.</i>

574
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:11.956
Escobar and M-19?

575
00:37:12.097 --> 00:37:14.378
<i>She didn't tell me any details.
just that it would be bad.</i>

576
00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:16.367
No... that doesn't make any sense.

577
00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:19.233
<i>She asked me to hide her.
so I took her to Javi's apartment.</i>

578
00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:20.361
OK. All right.

579
00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:34.865
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

580
00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:38.081
Ambassador. I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

581
00:37:38.323 --> 00:37:40.792
- <i>supreme court building.</i>
- Oh. my God.

582
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.789
<i>"Oh. my God" is right.</i>

583
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:48.332
<i>Financed by Escobar. the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice</i>

584
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.933
<i>and occupied the supreme court.</i>

585
00:37:51.169 --> 00:37:54.230
<i>They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands</i>

586
00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:57.969
<i>about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...</i>

587
00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.734
<i>but it was all bullshit.</i>

588
00:38:00.779 --> 00:38:02.077
<i>The military attacked.</i>

589
00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:04.009
<i>Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage.</i>

590
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:07.582
<i>including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.</i>

591
00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:10.187
<i>Most of the M-19 were killed.</i>

592
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:14.449
<i>Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:</i>

593
00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:21.833
<i>setting fire to the room that contained
600.000 pages of evidence against Escobar.</i>

594
00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:25.593
<i>The entire case against him
turned to ash.</i>

595
00:38:29.741 --> 00:38:33.178
<i>In the United States.
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear</i>

596
00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:35.280
<i>so they can't testify in court.</i>

597
00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:40.708
<i>In Colombia. Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.</i>

598
00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:47.052
<i>The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger</i>

599
00:38:47.192 --> 00:38:49.684
<i>as cannon shells exploded inside.</i>

600
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:59.035
- Where is she?
- Well. come on in.

601
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.468
You. up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

602
00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:03.837
Put the gun away.

603
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.004
Put it away.

604
00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:09.214
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

605
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.475
- Can I say something?
- No. you may not.

606
00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:15.076
Murphy... calm down.

607
00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:18.822
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

608
00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:21.051
Your wife brought her to me.

609
00:39:22.794 --> 00:39:25.491
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife. I truly do.

610
00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:27.708
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

611
00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:30.600
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

612
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:36.864
If she can tie Escobar to the siege.
I say we bring her in.

613
00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:38.534
Well. she's M-19.

614
00:39:38.643 --> 00:39:41.010
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

615
00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:42.341
and then she gets disappeared.

616
00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:44.678
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

617
00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.876
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

618
00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:49.284
Look. all she did was warn us.

619
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.855
She's not on anybody's radar.

620
00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.016
She's not involved in anything.

621
00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:02.029
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

622
00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:04.534
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

623
00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.638
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

624
00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:11.368
Folks. this is more complicated
than what it seems.

625
00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:14.935
This was Escobar. classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

626
00:40:16.281 --> 00:40:18.773
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the <i>Titanic.</i>

627
00:40:19.017 --> 00:40:21.987
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

628
00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.415
He doesn't hold grudges.
not if it suits his purposes.

629
00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:28.425
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

630
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.061
You willing to identify this informant.
Agent Peña?

631
00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:34.826
- No. I am not.
- Needless to say...

632
00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:38.494
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

633
00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.730
in light of this communist aggression.

634
00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.670
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

635
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:45.740
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

636
00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:09.031
They're looking for us everywhere.

637
00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.102
What did you expect?

638
00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.137
That it would be any different?

639
00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:19.667
You did a very good job.

640
00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:36.953
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

641
00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:40.188
No. brother.
The truth is. you helped mine.

642
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:44.892
You. Ivan...

643
00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:49.235
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

644
00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:53.806
The same one that freed this country.

645
00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:01.380
Now it belongs to you.

646
00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:11.328
With it. you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

647
00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:17.501
I promise you.
I will continue the fight.

648
00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.670
You earned it. brother.

649
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.935
As for me...

650
00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:26.277
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

651
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.846
We are also...

652
00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:35.345
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

653
00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:38.714
And the fucking sword.
