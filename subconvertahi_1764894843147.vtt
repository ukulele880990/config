﻿1
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:10.552
Lester likened all the tenants
to birds. his favorite hobby.

2
00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.514
And you were the cuckoo chick!

3
00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:15.682
The neediest bird
of all. a taker.

4
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.850
The taker?

5
00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.561
Mabel. what's the first
word that comes to mind

6
00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:19.728
when you think of me?

7
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.481
-Oh. narcissist.
-What the hell?

8
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.649
Oh. my God.

9
00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.109
Mabel Mora?

10
00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.444
Althea?

11
00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.197
Actually. it's THĒ now.
I shortened it. T-H-Ē.

12
00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:33.158
Something's not adding up.

13
00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.494
Well. I guess it wouldn't
hurt to take a little peek.

14
00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.745
We're doing an autopsy?

15
00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.248
A meat cleaver to the
chest. Maybe cocaine?

16
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.083
I got it! Money amounts.

17
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.751
"Brown-headed cowbird."

18
00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.545
Maybe these are code names.

19
00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:47.673
There might be a game
tonight. We have to go.

20
00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.384
Lester and Nicky
have both been here.

21
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.557
You're gonna get us killed by
a bunch of murderous mobsters.

22
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.475
They're all billionaires.

23
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.812
This isn't the mob. This
is the new mob of New York.

24
00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:11.280
How does it feel to be
worth a billion dollars?

25
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:14.157
If I'm honest. not
as good as it felt

26
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.787
to win my first hundred
dollars on a perfect bluff.

27
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.083
That was the day I fell
in love with parlor games.

28
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.459
and with winning.

29
00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.590
I was five years old when I
first beat my father at chess.

30
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.885
Before that. I thought he was
the smartest person in the world.

31
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.348
Broke my heart to
learn that I was.

32
00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.143
that no one would beat me
for the rest of my life.

33
00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.395
What fun is that?

34
00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.024
The problem for most rich people
is that there's no amount of money

35
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.650
that can make 'em
stop wanting more.

36
00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.486
Money's a game. and
they love to win.

37
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.531
I know people see me as a rich guy.
but I barely even think about money.

38
00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.033
which is why I'm so normal.

39
00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.910
Alright. good.

40
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.204
Take that. Throw the ball.

41
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.664
Go get it.

42
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.876
It's great getting
out with the pup.

43
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.961
He can't find it. Go get it.

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.074
Do you want subtitles for any video?
-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-

45
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.309
Not a typical Saturday night.

46
00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.395
I think our days of typical
nights here are behind us.

47
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.563
Let's be fast about this.

48
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.527
Are we going to talk about...

49
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.110
-What was that?
-Maybe a rat?

50
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.161
Who's in here?

51
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.089
Why are the richest people
in the world in our basement?

52
00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.049
And did they kill our doorman?

53
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.467
Find out next season on...

54
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.552
Oh. I'm taking a panorama.

55
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.614
Jay Pflug has a bandaged
nub. and we have a finger.

56
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:03.493
I don't think it's a huge leap to
assume that our finger goes on his nub.

57
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.788
Oh. he's definitely a suspect.
At the least. he was involved.

58
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:09.040
Maybe the cleaver that
was in Nicky's chest

59
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.542
also chopped off Jay's finger.

60
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.294
And Lester was down there.
Maybe he saw something

61
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.837
-he shouldn't have.
-Hello.

62
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.840
What the hell?

63
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.341
I'm LESTR.

64
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.470
Aw. look how moved everyone is.

65
00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.221
Meet our new
doorman. We named him

66
00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.098
after the dead one. in tribute.

67
00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.434
L-E-S-T-R.

68
00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.146
Logic Engineered
Secure Tenant Robot.

69
00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.981
Those words don't even
make sense together.

70
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.233
They're trying to trick us
into thinking it's a tribute

71
00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:38.028
-instead of the rise of the machine.
-That's true.

72
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.323
My greatest challenge is my
unsettling effect on humans.

73
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:44.576
Well. I've seen The Terminator.
so I'm on Team Machine.

74
00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.163
As the keeper of the building's secrets.
the board hired me to train LESTR.

75
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.249
This is so sad. A robot doorman.

76
00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.668
The beginning of the
end of old New York.

77
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.295
No!

78
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:59.925
See. the machine will just handle
things like deliveries or reminders.

79
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.010
Thanks to the
union... my union...

80
00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.387
there will always be a
human face at the door.

81
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.432
Just. hopefully this human.

82
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:10.143
He's right. We couldn't
get rid of him.

83
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.855
I just need to scan everyone's
iris and fingerprint.

84
00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.775
That thing's not getting
anywhere near my irises.

85
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:19.444
Alright. I'm gonna
get my hair done.

86
00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:22.113
God knows why. since
nobody ever notices.

87
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.994
What's happening to our
sweet little murder building?

88
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.581
Yeah. Things are changing fast.

89
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.545
-Are you doing toe raises?
-Yeah. I do toe raises.

90
00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.213
I've never seen
you do a toe raise.

91
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.674
Have you ever seen me brush
my teeth? I do that too.

92
00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.976
I took Winnie's doggy
Ritalin. stayed up all night.

93
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.145
-and basically solved this.
-You two are a lot for me today.

94
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.647
-Vince.
-What are you doing here?

95
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.607
And look at you with two eyes.

96
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.777
Hiya. guys. Lester and
I were birding buddies.

97
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.405
So. Oliver invited me up
here to decode the ledger.

98
00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.574
figure out which one of
the birds was playing cards

99
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.909
-on the night that he died.
-You birded with Lester?

100
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:09.452
Well. he was the expert.

101
00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.413
I just followed along
to keep him honest.

102
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:15.166
He had a knack for turning
a robin into a bushtit...

103
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.835
...if you know what I mean.

104
00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.461
No one has any
idea what you mean.

105
00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.046
Well. he was an optimist.

106
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.049
Very good at life.
but not so at birding.

107
00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:26.261
But I miss him. I miss
our days in the park.

108
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:27.554
Sit. sit.

109
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:29.931
Okay.

110
00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:32.893
Oh-ho. wow!

111
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:36.479
An Oliver Putnam murder
board. Love the sari.

112
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:39.316
Yeah. from my '70s
Rajneesh days.

113
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.067
Please let that be a hash stain.

114
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.112
That's a lot of work.
Oliver. what happened to you?

115
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.406
Well. I thought about what
you said to me the other day

116
00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.700
when you complimented
me. What'd you call me?

117
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.536
-Self-centered narcissist.
-Yes. that... that was it.

118
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.538
Anyway. I heard it.

119
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:57.125
So. last night. as I lay
there thinking about myself...

120
00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.878
the strangest thing happened.

121
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.588
I suddenly thought about you

122
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.174
and how you always
make the murder boards.

123
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.594
So. I thought to myself.
I'll do it. for you.

124
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.220
Bravo. Oliver. Bravo.

125
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.139
-What growth.
-Okay.

126
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.724
We did solve one mystery:

127
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.352
why Lester wrote down
the player's names

128
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.479
using a secret bird code.

129
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.189
They're the most powerful
people in the world.

130
00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.107
He was scared of them.

131
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:24.736
Somebody be recordin'. because I
am about to get birdie with it.

132
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.655
Per Lester's notes.

133
00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:30.700
the gaming parlor usually
hosted a whole flock of birds.

134
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.494
But last Saturday.

135
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.620
there were only five.

136
00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.247
Now. first. Nicky.

137
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.375
He is the Brown-headed cowbird.

138
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.671
known for their mafia-like
retaliatory behavior.

139
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.424
Oof! Okay. 'kay. 'kay.

140
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.759
you don't have to do the calls.

141
00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.552
Well. it sounds like
a mobster. doesn't it?

142
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:53.223
Next. Jay Pflug. heir
to the Pflug fortune.

143
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.977
maker of Pflug faucets. which
gave everybody lead poisoning.

144
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.270
So. they founded Pflug Pharma.

145
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:02.649
which invented a medicine
to cure lead poisoning.

146
00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.234
Made billions.

147
00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.946
He branded himself as. uh. this
black sheep philanthropist.

148
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.990
but the guy is a monster.

149
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.284
His last nonprofit funneled
money to guerrilla groups.

150
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.203
The terrorists.
not the primates.

151
00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.622
L-Let's... let's
keep it on birds.

152
00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.040
He's the Eurasian Jay.

153
00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.170
I. too. get my bird on.

154
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.881
Okay. lotta new colors on you.

155
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:31.761
Anyway. since the Jay
bird is missing a claw...

156
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.805
No. I'm sorry. I'm done.

157
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.765
He's missing a finger.
so. it's obviously...

158
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.976
No. no. no. We're not done.

159
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.185
Bash Steed.

160
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.313
AI genius. longevity freak.

161
00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.941
Way older than he looks.
but no one knows how old

162
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.317
because he owns the internet.

163
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.361
Now. I have to find
out how old he is.

164
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.655
He is the kākāpō.

165
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.703
They are known to live up
to 90 years in the wild.

166
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.122
And finally. Camila White.

167
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.500
Lifestyle queen. hotel magnate.

168
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.377
duchess of cashmere.

169
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.589
You can buy a candle that smells
like the inside of her nose.

170
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.966
She is the queen of decor.

171
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.803
The bowerbird. maker
of beautiful nests.

172
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.682
Ah!

173
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:22.520
Okay. anyways. there's a
finger in Charles's freezer

174
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.731
and we have a suspect
missing a finger.

175
00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.942
So. how do we get to Jay?

176
00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.073
-We let him know we're onto him.
-Ahh.

177
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.991
Yes.

178
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.494
And while we here at Only
Murders in the Building

179
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.955
aren't pointing
fingers just yet...

180
00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:44.125
...we're wading into the dangerous
waters of both old mob and new.

181
00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.794
Uber rich powerbrokers

182
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.879
who don't have to break an
arm to get what they want.

183
00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.464
They just write a check.

184
00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.091
No one writes checks anymore.

185
00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:54.594
We already have some ideas
about who has a partial hand

186
00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:57.722
in these two deaths. so
don't miss season five.

187
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.099
This is so good.

188
00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.684
Oh. we're definitely
gonna hear from him.

189
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.143
He'll wanna defend himself.

190
00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:03.853
Post. young one!

191
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.231
I do wish we'd worked
in the word "phalange."

192
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:10.110
Okay. for the last time. Charles.
phalange-thropist is not a good pun.

193
00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.486
That's funny.

194
00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.655
-To you.
-Mm.

195
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.081
Oh. my God. hi!

196
00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.874
Althea... THĒ.

197
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.501
Um. this is Oliver.

198
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.921
-Oh. hello. How are you?
-Hi. Cute pillows.

199
00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:32.674
Yes. I'm bequeathing them to
young Mabel for her new apartment.

200
00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.843
That is so kind of you.

201
00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:39.764
I mean. I could buy myself pillows.
it's just. these are vintage Missoni.

202
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.975
THĒ! Hi!

203
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.102
Howard Morris.

204
00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.437
That's THĒ.

205
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.022
-Uh. hello. Howard.
-Hi.

206
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.775
THĒ is the number one
most downloaded artist...

207
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.527
...for 13 weeks in a row.

208
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.029
Here's her current hit.

209
00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.531
♪ Oh. that's cute ♪

210
00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:59.951
-♪ You're thinking 'bout me all day ♪
-Oh. excuse me. pardon me. Ah!

211
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.412
Glamorous! Okay.

212
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.122
Oh. my God. stop it!

213
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.624
Wait. why did it stop?

214
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.918
Oh. I'm just...
I'm just kidding.

215
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.255
Anyway. Mabel. how are you?
How's your little podcast going?

216
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:16.009
Great. We dropped our season
five teaser a few days ago.

217
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.178
Their listens are 24% lower

218
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:20.055
than their season four teaser.

219
00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:24.267
Oh. did you all hear the new
podcast Drunk Sluts Do Murder?

220
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.394
Oh. my God. yes.
I love the sluts.

221
00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.605
-Do people say "slut" again?
-Sluts do.

222
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.773
Did you hear the one where
they play strip beer pong

223
00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.734
-with the forensics expert?
-Beyond.

224
00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.486
Drunk Sluts Do Murder

225
00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.446
are ranked 19 spots higher
than Only Murders...

226
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.656
No. No. don't feel bad.

227
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.575
Don't feel bad. It's just
'cause Wondify is. like.

228
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.452
shoving the sluts down
our throats. you know?

229
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.538
It's so hard to get noticed
when you're indie. right?

230
00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.083
We actually just signed
a huge deal at Wondify.

231
00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.170
So. be prepared to have
us down your throats. too.

232
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.922
We did?

233
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.965
I mean. I... I still
can't believe it.

234
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.052
That is amazing! Oh my God.
so you know what you need?

235
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.970
You need my publicist.
He's so intuitive.

236
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.389
He's psychic. and
he's a hired assassin.

237
00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.725
But you did not hear
that from me. okay?

238
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.352
Bye. Howard! Bye. robot.

239
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.686
-Bye. girl!
-Bye. girl.

240
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:17.070
So. I lied. but maybe
that's not a bad thing.

241
00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:20.323
because now I'm sending
in this kick-ass pitch.

242
00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.784
and they'll offer us
a podcast deal. right?

243
00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.953
I mean. there's already
a movie about us.

244
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.830
and I... I'm. you
know. just shocked

245
00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:31.000
that they haven't come
to us already. you know?

246
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.253
Mabel. why did you do this?

247
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.089
Okay. fine.

248
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:40.093
Althea and I were each other's
only friend in middle school.

249
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.096
I trusted her with everything.

250
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.223
And we'd make these
stupid little videos

251
00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.142
where we'd play these
characters. Sunny and Cloudy.

252
00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:51.354
Sunny was optimistic.
Cloudy was. well. cloudy.

253
00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.731
-And you were Cloudy.
-No. I was Sunny.

254
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.525
Oh. so that's the joke.

255
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.152
-What do you mean?
-Uh. just continue.

256
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.948
Anyway. then when Zoe died...

257
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:05.034
Zoe... is a familiar name.

258
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.204
Oliver. Mabel's
friend. The roof.

259
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.206
Oh. from season one!

260
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.916
Oh. my God. that was so sad.

261
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.211
Yeah. well. I... I
wasn't doing that great.

262
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:19.173
I stayed here for the
summer and depressed.

263
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.428
And then. when I went home.
Althea had completely changed.

264
00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:27.015
She had made all new friends
and turned everyone against me.

265
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:30.810
I kind of spiraled and spent
the rest of high school

266
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.478
in my room with Tumblr.

267
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.105
That's a pornography site.

268
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.316
Not anymore. They ruined it.

269
00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:41.029
Well. now. the person who has
turned me off having friends...

270
00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.906
...is here at number one

271
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.199
while we are 32. and...

272
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.537
Um. are my old-men friends
texting while I trauma dump?

273
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.081
Jay Pflug just sent us a video.

274
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.710
Hey. podcasters.
heard your teaser.

275
00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:59.547
Sounds like you have some thoughts.
I'll be by at 7:00 to clear things up.

276
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.091
Oh. shit.

277
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.594
Om...

278
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.513
A billionaire is
coming to dinner.

279
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.023
Champagne. caviar. Godiva.

280
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.192
This is what you're serving
a billionaire for dinner?

281
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.943
No. no. no. we
don't serve dinner.

282
00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.321
We serve salty sweets
to make him thirsty.

283
00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.406
then offer him nothing
to drink but bubbly.

284
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.992
He'll get blackout and tell
us everything. This is my way.

285
00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:32.622
Yes. let's get a possible murderer
hangry and drunk. Great plan.

286
00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.125
If you invite someone over at
7:00. you have to serve 'em dinner.

287
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.044
It's a rule of society.
And that's why I brought...

288
00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.255
What is that. the Magna Carta?

289
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:44.008
No. it's my great-gran's
recipe for duck à I'orange.

290
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.802
It's a billionaire's delight.

291
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.638
Charles. no one needs your
17th-century old lady food

292
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.390
and outdated social rules.

293
00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:53.059
Do you know how many billionaires
I've entertained here?

294
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.896
Well. technically none.
but plenty of millionaires.

295
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.731
which were the
billionaires of the '80s.

296
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.734
Alright. we are interrogating.
not entertaining.

297
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.320
Ah. yeah. but you need
one for the other.

298
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.279
This is one of the
richest people on Earth.

299
00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.865
He wants courses.
Many. many courses.

300
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.451
-Etiquette is not dead.
-I think etiquette died

301
00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.662
four months after the
internet was invented.

302
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.915
and that guy's head went
into an elephant's ass.

303
00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:17.792
Ah. well.

304
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.502
He's early. He's
an early bird.

305
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.920
Okay. okay.

306
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.466
Oh. Jay. welcome. Come in.

307
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.009
I come bearing gifts.

308
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.386
-Ah.
-Never show up empty-handed.

309
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.764
Though. I'm a little handicapped.
if you don't mind grabbing that.

310
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.766
Oh-ho. Beer. how generous.

311
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:38.896
Ah. stoked to meet you all.

312
00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.984
One of the reasons why I play cards here
is because it's the murder building.

313
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:45.695
and that is all because of you.

314
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.239
Well. we give a lot of
credit to the murderers.

315
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:52.243
Say. so. uh. what has you playing
cards in our famous Velvet Room?

316
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.163
You know. I started
a few months ago...

317
00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:03.212
Man. I knew I was
being followed.

318
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.634
Good evening. Camila White.

319
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:15.266
Oh. isn't this an assaulting
amount of everything?

320
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.352
Better.

321
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.233
Oh. my goodness.

322
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.861
Jay. is that you?

323
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.614
-I had no idea you'd be here.
-Mm-hmm.

324
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.866
Well. I heard the podcast. and
it seemed like these people

325
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.035
thought you were involved
in the mob killing.

326
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:37.497
Camila White.
charmed. Camila White.

327
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.833
Oh. dear God. A plum plaid.

328
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.087
So. I'm here to
clear Jay's name.

329
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.381
Fuck off. Camila. I'm
here to clear my name.

330
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.259
You were worried about
what I'd say about you.

331
00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.636
That is certainly not true.

332
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:55.431
and I don't like the ugly use
of words that end in hard Ks.

333
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.058
Shall we begin again?

334
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.976
Softer consonants?

335
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.979
Our host brought
four chocolates.

336
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.859
Hello. Sebastian Steed.

337
00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.113
No... I'd invite you in
if I had more chocolates.

338
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.827
Oh. my God. You're spying on us.

339
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.431
Of course he is. he
owns the internet.

340
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.957
Just stopping by
for a drink. Bash?

341
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.460
No. I'm here because
they're investigating you.

342
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.337
Naturally. I've been
having you followed.

343
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.422
I knew you'd try
to pin it on me.

344
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.175
Thanks for your
robot-like honesty.

345
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.385
You're welcome.

346
00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.933
Well. we're really
having a party here.

347
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.268
Please. have a seat.

348
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.352
Whoo!

349
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.774
Who needs champagne?

350
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.403
Oh. I'll have a '97 Bordeaux.

351
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.281
-I don't think I have that.
-Oh. truly.

352
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.242
any '97 Bordeaux will do.

353
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.786
I don't have any'97 Bordeaux.

354
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:05.293
So. I'm noticing three of the
richest people in the world

355
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:07.295
are here in our little building.

356
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:09.046
I'm top three. they're top 20.

357
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.132
Sebastian. on many
lists I'm four.

358
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:14.302
Uh. the point is that you
all seem a little nervous

359
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.221
about what our little
investigation has uncovered.

360
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.889
No one's nervous.

361
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.809
We're all here for
one reason. Yeah?

362
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:24.145
Yes. To give you the opportunity

363
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:27.398
to keep us out of your podcast
before we sue you for libel.

364
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.402
Libel. wow.

365
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:34.530
Let's... let's just turn
down the temp a tad.

366
00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.741
and. uh. let's
nibble some caviar...

367
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.619
Oh.

368
00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.120
Oops. I'm so sorry.

369
00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:43.497
There really wasn't very much.

370
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.251
It's not libel to say we found you
sniffing around a murder scene.

371
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.671
What do you mean?

372
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.423
The news said that
the body was found

373
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:54.884
hanging from a rack in
his own dry cleaners?

374
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.970
Yes. I... I don't know why
you're even looking into this.

375
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:01.223
I mean. my people say you
do murders in the building.

376
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.893
It's an odd business model.
this "in the building" rule.

377
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.687
Your metrics would
improve with a wider net.

378
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.315
Bash. always be talking metrics.

379
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:11.442
Well. the dry cleaners
is on the street level.

380
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.778
so technically. it
is "of" the building.

381
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:17.073
Listen. nobody
wants to sue anyone.

382
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.742
We just can't have our names
tied to secret card games

383
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.535
-and dead mobsters. you know?
-Mm.

384
00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.413
My stock crashes.
and tens of thousands

385
00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.540
of indigenous weavers go hungry.

386
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:27.833
Because she fires 'em.

387
00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.336
Yes. why else would
they go hungry?

388
00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.965
So. the three of you knew the
"Dry Cleaning King of Brooklyn"?

389
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.551
The dead mobster? Not at all.

390
00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.595
I know he owned
the gaming parlor.

391
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.808
The mobby shit's always been part
of what makes the place so cool.

392
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.685
What's there to investigate?

393
00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:49.188
A mob hit is very open and
shut. Won't be your best season.

394
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.274
Well. we're also investigating
the death of our doorman.

395
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.359
Did you know him?

396
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:58.781
I mean. there was a guy
who always covered the door

397
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.117
for the Saturday games.
Uh. gray mustache?

398
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.619
That was Lester. It was
ruled natural causes

399
00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:04.912
because of a fall.

400
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.999
Yes. falls are the leading cause
of injury deaths in the elderly.

401
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.585
-You two. be careful.
-Our Pilates instructor says we have

402
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.629
-the gait stability of 46-year-olds.
-It's true.

403
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.131
If you're serious
about age-reversal.

404
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.800
you have to consider
plasma replacement therapy.

405
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.678
I own a stable of
teen plasma donors.

406
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:26.016
We have reason to believe that Nicky
died last week when Lester died.

407
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.310
There were signs that
Nicky was frozen.

408
00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:32.231
Someone hid his body to make it
look like they were unrelated.

409
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.900
Oh. you got your
hands on the body.

410
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:35.985
Wow.

411
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.278
I mean. can you admit that

412
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.822
on a podcast? That's
a felony. right?

413
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.241
I'm sure they went to the
authorities immediately.

414
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:43.325
Mm.

415
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.290
Mm-hmm. Um. you know what.
let's get you some more caviar.

416
00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:51.250
-Mm. Absolutely.
-Let's get it. I think there's more caviar

417
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.335
-in the kitchen.
-I'm good.

418
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.170
-We definitely have bologna.
-And. uh.

419
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.255
I think there's
a fresher bottle.

420
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.884
Okay. okay. okay. I was
not prepared for all three.

421
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.803
Are they making veiled
threats or being charming?

422
00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:02.970
I can't tell.

423
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.765
Let's split them up and see what
they say about Jay's finger.

424
00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.558
I'll take Jay because
we're not old.

425
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.811
And Charles should take Bash
because they're both. well.

426
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.771
what we used to call
"the weird kid."

427
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.148
Aw.

428
00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.196
Camila! I... I just have
a few more questions.

429
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.989
Can I give you a tour?

430
00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.073
Fine.

431
00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:27.995
If you can stop yelling.
a tour before dinner.

432
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.748
Dinner! I said we need dinner.

433
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:33.250
Of course. a party
at 7:00 means dinner.

434
00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:36.128
Thank you. Bash! Gimme a hand?

435
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.215
If the servants don't mind.

436
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.176
Oh. the servants
aren't gonna mind.

437
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.222
Beer?

438
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.687
So. Jay...

439
00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.817
How'd you lose the finger?

440
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.070
How'd those two old guys
become your best friends?

441
00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:03.864
Nice.

442
00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:11.664
So. how well do you know Jay?

443
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:14.416
Have you... have you two been
playing together for long?

444
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.710
All I know about Jay

445
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:20.005
is he has a tantrum like
a toddler when he loses...

446
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:22.716
-Ooh.
-...which is tragic and amusing.

447
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.845
I'm sorry. but every room

448
00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:28.722
-in this house needs me.
-Oh.

449
00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:32.184
Are those the Statler and
Waldorf balconies on your wall?

450
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:35.980
Ha! Well. I'm... I'm
a theater director.

451
00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:39.400
So. you thought. "I should put
theater directing on my walls"?

452
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:44.864
Well. but. the... the beauty of
this place is really its stories.

453
00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:46.991
Uh. like my ex-wife.
uh. loved these drapes.

454
00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:50.244
so I fought to keep
them out of spite.

455
00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:52.496
Not necessarily
my finest moment.

456
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.750
but. uh. not all the
stories in here are great.

457
00:22:58.252 --> 00:23:01.797
Well. this looks great.

458
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.010
This is great. It's my new wife.

459
00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:09.805
And she moved in... to all this?

460
00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:13.976
Uh. well. n... Uh. not yet.

461
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:17.062
but. uh. you know. I mean...

462
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.232
I love duck à I'orange.

463
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:22.693
During the war we only
had duck at Christmas.

464
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:24.653
Oh. and... and
which war was that?

465
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:28.198
"Three sprigs of
parsley." Uh. I'll chop.

466
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.875
Haven't cooked in decades.

467
00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.836
So. you haven't used a...
a cleaver in a while.

468
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.797
You know anybody else who
might have used a cleaver?

469
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.381
-Anybody?
-Isn't it interesting?

470
00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:47.635
None of us will leave
behind written recipes.

471
00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:50.930
Future generations will just
have bookmarks on chef robots.

472
00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:53.641
Yeah. it's. uh...
it's true. it's sad.

473
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:55.476
You know. the... the
times are changing.

474
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:58.562
especially for us old guys in
our... How old did you say you were?

475
00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.022
That depends on the organ.

476
00:24:01.023 --> 00:24:05.986
Charles. wallowing takes
six years off your life.

477
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.323
Dorothy Parker told me
that. She took my virginity.

478
00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:12.993
Point is. you're only old if
you don't change with the times.

479
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:15.913
You know. technology's
helped me stay young.

480
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:18.165
But reinvention is the real key.

481
00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:22.252
Yeah. that... it... it takes
a lot of energy keeping up.

482
00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:24.421
Yeah. it does.

483
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:27.508
Every time I've put a wife in
assisted living and had to start over.

484
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:29.593
I've had moments of
doubt that I could do it.

485
00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:30.970
But I did.

486
00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:32.054
And you can.

487
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.640
Well. thank you.

488
00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:37.977
Now. how much orange zest
goes in great-gran's...

489
00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:41.939
Oh! No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

490
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:45.985
My great-gran is gone!

491
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.611
It's gone.

492
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:49.530
No!

493
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:50.614
How much orange zest

494
00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:53.659
is in Charles-Haden Savage's
great-gran's duck à I'orange recipe?

495
00:24:54.952 --> 00:24:56.829
There are
one-and-a-half teaspoons

496
00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:59.456
of orange zest in that recipe.

497
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.250
How did it know that?

498
00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.961
Show me Charles-Haden Savage

499
00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:05.629
making duck à I'orange.

500
00:25:05.713 --> 00:25:07.924
That sounds like a
lot of zest. Brazzos.

501
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:09.425
I'm zesty. Regis.

502
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:11.051
Yes. you're a
multi-talented guy.

503
00:25:11.135 --> 00:25:13.346
I admire guys like that. that
could do more than one thing.

504
00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:15.014
I just revel in it.

505
00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:17.350
Probably in ten minutes. something
unbelievable is gonna happen.

506
00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:20.519
Why do I think it's gonna be
me making your duck à I'orange?

507
00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.688
Well. Regis. because
you're psychic.

508
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:23.981
We're gonna take
a commercial break

509
00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:26.233
and make it happen
in the next segment.

510
00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:29.528
I forgot I did that.

511
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.572
My great-gran lives on.

512
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:32.656
Thank you.

513
00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:35.576
This is why I do what I do.

514
00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:39.747
In the right hands. technology should
keep the past alive. preserved.

515
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.333
like I'm preserved every night
floating in my tank of collagen.

516
00:25:45.836 --> 00:25:48.839
-I also had a sad home.
-Ah.

517
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:50.674
My first one.

518
00:25:50.758 --> 00:25:53.677
A young girl with a
deep love of beauty.

519
00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:57.514
born to a casino magnate and
his former showgirl wife.

520
00:25:57.598 --> 00:26:00.350
raised amidst a sea of hot pink

521
00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:02.269
in Reno.

522
00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:03.812
Eww. so sorry.

523
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:06.482
The moment I turned 18.

524
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.610
I moved... to Connecticut.

525
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:11.779
-Oh.
-Leaving that home

526
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:14.114
jump-started my mission
to beautify the world.

527
00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:16.784
and it turned me
into a billionaire.

528
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:20.204
And I started with nothing.

529
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:24.833
So. are... are you
saying that Loretta and I

530
00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.127
should start fresh?
Get a new place?

531
00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:30.506
-These bones are remarkable.
-Ah.

532
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.842
You just need to
change everything.

533
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.183
So. uh. come on. the finger?

534
00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.476
I gotta know.

535
00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:46.230
The only crime I'm guilty of is
being an embarrassing nepo baby

536
00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:50.400
who's trying to do some good
with his ancestors' blood money.

537
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:51.860
Yeah. and how's that going?

538
00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:55.280
I started my own
nonprofit. hired a CEO.

539
00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:59.284
a friend of mine I trusted.
who then took all the money.

540
00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:01.036
Everyone thinks I'm a swindler.

541
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.622
but really. I'm just shit
at knowing who to trust.

542
00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:06.959
I'm sure it'll happen again.

543
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.585
Then. why keep trying?

544
00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:15.134
Because I wanna prove to everyone
that I'm not a... fuck up.

545
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:24.852
Are you aware of the
pop sensation THĒ?

546
00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:28.522
Uh. the "The" girl? Yeah. why?

547
00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:32.442
She is someone I
incorrectly trusted.

548
00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:36.738
She couldn't be
more frustrating.

549
00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:40.826
and I... I can't stop
wanting to impress her.

550
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:45.372
So. I lied and said we were
getting a deal at Wondify.

551
00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:46.832
and we aren't.

552
00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:49.251
So. now I have to try
to make that happen.

553
00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:50.961
I'm sure it won't.

554
00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:53.714
And I hate myself for that.

555
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:57.342
♪ Wish that you were me. bet
you wish that you were me ♪

556
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:59.136
I will literally kill you.

557
00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:01.096
She wrote that. I
feel like. about me.

558
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.931
It's really good. It's catchy.

559
00:28:05.893 --> 00:28:08.353
I was playing with these
bozos the night Nicky died.

560
00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:10.230
but I did not kill anyone.

561
00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:13.358
So. what happened
with your finger?

562
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:19.740
Just another bad decision in
a long line of bad decisions.

563
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.747
While we have a quiet moment.

564
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.209
I wanna help you make sure you
stay out of our little story.

565
00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:33.378
But what happened
to Jay's finger?

566
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:36.882
Fine.

567
00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:40.219
The night Lester died.

568
00:28:40.302 --> 00:28:42.888
Nicky showed up
with this cleaver.

569
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:46.099
Wa... Was he mad at
someone? Maybe Jay?

570
00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:50.354
He was livid and raving
about the film "Goodfellows"?

571
00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:53.857
He had an inordinate
amount of white powder

572
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:55.484
under his nose.

573
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:58.237
I'd call it a Snow White white.

574
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.281
or perhaps a
Santa's beard white.

575
00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:02.699
He was nuts.

576
00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.952
He was gonna hit someone.
I tried to stop him.

577
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:07.037
I mean. Bash is
covered in baby skin.

578
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.580
but he's pretty old.

579
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:11.792
Well. I tried to calm him down.
but Jay had to be the hero.

580
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.294
and so Nicky... "chh!"...
chopped off his finger.

581
00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:18.465
I obviously left
because of the mess.

582
00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:22.219
And also. it's rude to be the
last to leave a party. so...

583
00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:26.223
I told Jay not to escalate. but
chop-chop. Then we all ran out.

584
00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:29.351
There wasn't time to look for
it. which is why I went back.

585
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.730
It'd be nice not to have a
finger floating around. ya know?

586
00:29:32.813 --> 00:29:34.315
You didn't happen to see
it in there. did you?

587
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:37.943
Okay. Duck à I'orange

588
00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.945
is ready in two
hours and 45 minutes.

589
00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:42.489
-Who's hungry?
-I don't eat after 11 a.m..

590
00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:44.533
but have we answered
all your questions?

591
00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.869
Well. yes. I learned that
Nicky chopped off Jay's finger.

592
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:51.373
and then Bash. Camila.
and Jay ran out.

593
00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.667
-Yeah. that's what Jay said.
-And Lester and Nicky

594
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.043
were still alive. so...

595
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.796
Huh. look at you two not
lying to pin it on me.

596
00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:00.340
-You do care.
-Case closed.

597
00:30:00.424 --> 00:30:02.050
And now that we've
cleared this up.

598
00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:05.178
I trust I won't hear my
name on future episodes.

599
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:08.890
Okay. duck à I'orange in
two hours and 44 minutes.

600
00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:11.351
Ah. Next time.

601
00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:14.646
Forgot I have some friends coming
over to do some rock climbing.

602
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.273
Mabel...

603
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:17.357
thanks.

604
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.943
It was a really nice talk.

605
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:26.491
Touching food
again was pleasant.

606
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:30.078
Enjoy the remodel.

607
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.748
Wait. what remodel?

608
00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:40.839
Wow. this really is much better.

609
00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:42.507
How did we not hear anything?

610
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.885
She's a home decor witch!

611
00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:54.728
This is better.
The hot glue fumes

612
00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:57.397
from my apartment
jump-started my hangover.

613
00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.149
Does champagne expire?

614
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:01.735
Oh. you should really
lay off the alcohol.

615
00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:04.279
Uh. Bash says it
inflames your enzymes.

616
00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:06.406
Now. which war would
you think was going on

617
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.159
when Dorothy Parker was
in her sexual prime?

618
00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:11.286
First sexual prime. or second?

619
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.165
How crazy is it that we have Jay
Pflug's finger in your freezer?

620
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:17.084
At least we figured that out.

621
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:20.045
So. we're gonna
believe these three?

622
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.255
Oh. please. Camila is no killer.

623
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:25.300
Although. I felt like I was
spending a couple of hours

624
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:28.970
with a cross between Ann-Margret and
Nanette Fabray. so I almost died.

625
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.892
Jay didn't do it.

626
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.977
He was just trying
to protect everyone.

627
00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:39.731
He's. um... sweeter
than I expected.

628
00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:41.066
Mabel...

629
00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:44.069
did your eyelashes just flutter?

630
00:31:44.152 --> 00:31:47.489
Oliver. Jay makes Mabel's
eyelashes flutter.

631
00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:50.367
No. I'm n... Shut up.
I'm not fluttering.

632
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.620
It's just maybe we should
give him his finger back.

633
00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:55.664
Crushing on a suspect. Mabel?

634
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.541
This is really a
Charles storyline.

635
00:31:57.624 --> 00:31:58.834
-isn't it?
-Ugh.

636
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:00.753
If both of you couple up.

637
00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:04.548
that leaves me birding with Vince.
or getting a drink with a robot.

638
00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.676
Oh. my God. you guys.
Wondify wants to sign us.

639
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.761
They said that they
would love to have us

640
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:13.056
come see the studio and become
part of the Wondify family.

641
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.391
-Your email worked!
-You're kidding.

642
00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:16.059
Oh. take that. THĒ.

643
00:32:16.143 --> 00:32:18.562
Whoa. wish that
you were us. bitch!

644
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:20.356
Whoa. I didn't mean
for that to come out.

645
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.691
Wish that you were us. ma'am.

646
00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:25.569
-I'm very excited.
-Me too.

647
00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:34.536
Welcome. OMITB!

648
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.788
Congratulations. you have
a beautiful baby podcast.

649
00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:38.248
Oh. we're so excited.

650
00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:40.750
Let me give you a tour.
okay? I love the stripes.

651
00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:42.252
-Oh. thanks.
-It's fab.

652
00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:45.088
Some of our smaller
studios are that way.

653
00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:48.383
Oh. you're gonna love this.
Those are the Drunk Sluts.

654
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:51.094
Such champs. recorded
seven episodes today.

655
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:52.554
Oh my God...

656
00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.264
You're killin' it. ladies!

657
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.682
-Hi!
-Ah!

658
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:56.766
Okay.

659
00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:00.687
-This is your studio.
-Whoa. What?

660
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.314
Oh. really?

661
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:03.440
-Okay.
-Yeah.

662
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.066
Oh. my God.

663
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.985
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Thank you. Oh. water.

664
00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:08.653
Hello. how are you?

665
00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:10.239
-Oh. your camera operator.
-Hi.

666
00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:11.823
-Your engineer.
-Hi.

667
00:33:11.907 --> 00:33:13.200
-Hi.
-Look at the awards.

668
00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:15.911
-It's insane.
-Okay. uh. this'll do.

669
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:16.995
Okay.

670
00:33:17.954 --> 00:33:20.248
So. per the contract.
we'll relaunch you

671
00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:22.834
with a month-long stint
on our welcome page.

672
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:25.045
-Uh-huh.
-I told your lawyer between makeup lines

673
00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.589
and elder safety devices. you're
an advertising juggernaut.

674
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.259
Well. the timing
couldn't be better.

675
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.260
I mean. considering who
we're investigating.

676
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:35.096
we could use a little
extra firepower.

677
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.098
And it's a cast of
characters you dream of.

678
00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:39.392
You know. an... an
adulterous mob wife.

679
00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:41.853
Sebastian Steed and Camila
White running for their lives

680
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:44.105
after a mobster chops
off Jay Pflug's finger.

681
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:47.734
Incredible. Just one thing...

682
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:49.361
Sorry. Guys?

683
00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:53.323
Which way do your
pointers curve?

684
00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:56.660
They point away from each other.

685
00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:58.343
-Huh. never noticed that.
-Yeah.

686
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.164
Jay lost his right finger.

687
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.668
The finger we have curves left.

688
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:07.546
That lying piece of shit.

689
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:10.131
-This isn't his finger.
-So. who... Whose finger is it?

690
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:12.134
You mean. they were lying when
they told us what happened?

691
00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:13.760
They had gotten their
stories straight.

692
00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:16.263
Someone else was in
the room that night.

693
00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:19.224
someone that Lester didn't
put in his little bird ledger.

694
00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:21.101
Well. I'm ready to
start recording.

695
00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:23.478
I'm gonna take that
little nepo baby down.

696
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:25.188
Wow. what a twist.

697
00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:28.316
Just keep in mind the restrictions of
the corporate machine we have here.

698
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.026
Sorry? What restrictions?

699
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.028
Well. per the contract
you just signed.

700
00:34:32.112 --> 00:34:34.447
you're unable to podcast about
management of the company.

701
00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:36.199
Conflict of interest.

702
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:39.536
And we have new majority
stakeholders as of very recently.

703
00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.497
Um. who?

704
00:34:54.384 --> 00:34:56.595
The easiest way to win a game

705
00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:58.555
is to make your opponent
think they're playing

706
00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:00.640
a different game entirely.

707
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.186
-I confided in Jay.
-They joined forces.

708
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.022
They're all dirty.

709
00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:09.065
While focused on that game.

710
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:11.735
your opponent may give
you just what you need

711
00:35:11.818 --> 00:35:13.695
to win the real prize.

712
00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:16.990
Oh God. don't worry.

713
00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:20.243
If eliminating those three takes
the teeth out of this story.

714
00:35:20.327 --> 00:35:23.580
your deal can be rolled to
any other podcast ideas.

715
00:35:23.663 --> 00:35:25.999
You know. you're family now.

716
00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:29.252
and will remain exclusively
so for three years.

717
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:39.596
By the time they realize
what you've done...

718
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.016
game's over.
