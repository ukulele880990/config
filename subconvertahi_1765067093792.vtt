-That's what I would do.
-I know. Nora.

No one stood up against the narrow-minded
humans to protect the trolls.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.333
A cover-up…
for what the mission was really about.

[door buzzing]

185
00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:18.041
The operation. Professor Tidemann.
was never about the heavy water.

[lofty music rises]

187
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.583

Those who found him a century ago

192
00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.625
named him Jotun.

193
00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.958
after the primeval trolls from mythology.

194
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:27.125
But I…

195
00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:29.500
I call him

196
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:31.083
Mega-troll.

197
00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.166
Of course. we have safeguards in place.

198
00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.666
-For security.
-UV lights are pointed at the troll.

your creative solution in Oslo.

Mm-hm.

202
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.791
Have you all lost your minds?

203
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.750
-Do we have a visitor?
-[Nora] What is this?

204
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.208
[Andreas] Oh. Uh…

205
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:58.458
-Yes. Let me introduce Professor...
-Marion Auryn Rhadani.

206
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.583
I'm the project leader.

207
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:03.250
This is the legendary
Professor Nora Tidemann.

208
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:04.958
Of course I know who you are.

209
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:08.541
[in Farsi] I thought we agreed
not to involve her.

210
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.833
-[chuckles]
-[Marion] Hmm?

211
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.708
[in Farsi] If we don't show
any progress soon.

212
00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:17.208
they'll shut down the whole project.

213
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.208
[in English] Sorry. what did you say?

214
00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:22.041
My apologies. Farsi.

215
00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:23.875
I learned when I was in college.

216
00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.625
But Professor Rhadani
is an evolutionary biologist.

217
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.583
so she's been leading
this research for almost...

218
00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:29.583
-Two years.
-Two years.

219
00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:30.886
The past two years. yeah.

220
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.708
And Andreas has told us
all about your work

221
00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:36.750
and your heroics in Oslo.

222
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.041
Of course. it's not the outcome
that I would have liked.

223
00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:44.583
A conscious troll would have provided
many more useful answers.

224
00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:48.083
Okay. so… he's not dead?

225
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.541
No. Hibernating.

226
00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:52.291
Ever since it was discovered here.

227
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.375
the only sign of life is a pulse.

228
00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:58.291
Some kind of heart is hidden inside there.

229
00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:01.458
But it's unique.
It's unlike any animal on the planet.

230
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.625
The closest thing that I could ascribe
to it would be the forest floor.

231
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:09.791
Yeah. the DNA's a mystery.
It's more spruce tree than human.

Hm. Okay.

239
00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.666
Right. Are we finished here?

240
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.041
What? No!

241
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.458
You… you haven't seen it all.

242
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:38.041
Don't go yet. Come. come.

245
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.833
Siggy!

246
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.625
It's mine. [laughs]

-Really?
-Well. we weren't romantic at the start.

00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:07.500
No. but it became that way.
obviously. right?

00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:09.208
-Yeah. obviously.
-[Andreas laughs]

251

254
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.833
And if it's a girl. we'll name her Uhura.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.166
Hm. [chuckles]

256
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.125

Thank you.

258
00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.208
But… but that's not what
I wanted you to see.

259
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.791
Look around.

260
00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:35.125
In this area. we have texts written
in Latin. Old Norse. Sanskrit. and runes.

261
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:36.625
Some of them predate Christ.

262

All about trolls.

264
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:44.125

Its carbon date is around 1030.

268
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:03.583
Before he fell in the Battle
of Stiklestad. Just before or after.

269
00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.875
Well. um… not after. right?

270
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.250
[chuckles] He wouldn't be signing
anything from the grave. Yeah?

That's… that's the real deal.

what his intention was.

We know there was a troll from Dovre.

281
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.666
We have our troll here.

282
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.041
It's safe to assume that there may be more
trolls out there. We don't know how many.

-There's a very real chance…
-That another troll goes berserk.

We have to be prepared.

00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:48.750
If we're going to be ready.
first we need to…

Understand more.

287
00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.250
We have so many resources here to utilize.

288
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:57.666
but despite that.
the progress of our research has stopped.

Hey there.

This research could lead to breakthroughs
in medical science. Climate change...

399
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.292
You treat him like he's a being
with no inherent value.

400
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:08.958
You haven't looked at the implications.

401
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:13.333
Problem with your stupid implications is
placing humans over other sentient beings.

402
00:25:13.416 --> 00:25:14.833
-It's a recipe...
-You are both right.

403
00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:16.167
Andreas. stay out of this!

[Nora] Every living being has
inherent value and deserves respect.

It's eerily similar to

[Nora] You can't be so narrow-minded.

407
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.458
You're ignoring what's self-evident.
That this is a living being with feelings.

Ever since government officials and I
got the details surrounding Project Jotun.

424
00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:06.000
I believed the risks involved
were too high.

425
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:09.125
And the incident today.
it proves that I was right.

426
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:11.125
Martin. I have another idea.

427
00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:14.375
There's potentially
a great opportunity here.

428
00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:17.042
It's my view. if there's a chance
that we can capture it

429
00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:19.750
and get it under our control.
we can continue...

430
00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:21.791
There's no controlling natural forces.

431
00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:24.750
You can't go forward with that plan.

432
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:27.167
-That's my...
-Okay. well… what's your plan. then?

433
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.000
-Allow it to go free? Free to roam around?
-I didn't say that.

434
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.042
-Explain it. Tell us.
-I'm pointing to a problem...

435
00:26:32.125 --> 00:26:35.583
I know this research could be of value.
but I have to put Norwegian lives first.

436
00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:38.416
Therefore. I'm doing
what I should have done initially.

gonna repeat the same mistakes?

to stone because of us.

nothing from Dovre?

in a helicopter accident.

of the last prime minister.

Hey. is… is that a… a piece of…

00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:45.458
It's a piece of guilty conscience.

454
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.083
I screwed up. and it's a reminder.

455
00:27:57.166 --> 00:27:59.291
I have a talent for screwing up.

Where are you going?

-Yeah?
-Last time. you were a scientific advisor.

Technically. Ish.

485
00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:52.500
It would be irresponsible for a major
to take civilians on a mission.

Come on. Major. schmajor. stop with that.

-Sorry. it's time to go.

I wasn't insinuating that you…

494
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.625
No. that came out wrong. I meant to say...

495
00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:22.000
Lives were lost.
and I have to live with that.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.041

I kinda feel like it's my troll.

Oh. thanks.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.208
I never heard of a major going on

721
00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:00.583
Our families were…

722
00:45:00.666 --> 00:45:01.500
Tough.

723
00:45:01.583 --> 00:45:02.666
Oh.

724
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.625
[chuckles lightly]

725
00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.125
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

726
00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:09.625
No. it's refreshing.

727
00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:11.083
It seems to me like

728
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:13.625
there's a really big heart
hiding underneath

729
00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:16.541

[Andreas] Eww…

732
00:45:27.875 --> 00:45:29.625
Oh. God. What happened in here?

733
00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:32.083
It's a hunting pit.

734
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.041
According to the legend.
they wanted to get rid of the Troll King.

735
00:45:39.458 --> 00:45:42.125
so they kidnapped a troll child.

736
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:44.291
so the father would follow it here.

There are symbols carved in.

741
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:58.250
[Nora] They're Christian symbols.

742
00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:01.750
They're carved into each spike.
to inflict more damage on the trolls.

743
00:46:03.666 --> 00:46:07.500
But the Troll King survived the trap.
He escaped three years ago.

744
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.500
But if the story's true.
the question remains.

745
00:46:12.208 --> 00:46:15.458
Why weren't the remains
of the captured troll child ever found?

746
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:20.375
Hold still.

747
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:22.583

00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:50.166
We're here to find the tomb of Saint Olaf.

906
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.125
That's all we got.

907
00:59:53.208 --> 00:59:56.625
Well. the crazy nuts
didn't fall too far from the tree.

908
00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:57.791
Disserway!

909
01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:04.875
[Nora] We think the troll is coming here
to get revenge on Saint Olaf.

910
01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:06.541
-Huh.
-I read your book.

911
01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:11.242
You have a theory that Olaf's remains are
still somewhere in the cathedral. right?

912
01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.500
Folks always say. "Think outside the box."

913
01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:16.583
But sometimes the answer
lies within the box.

914
01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:19.500
Sometimes.
it's staring you smack in the kisser.

915
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.041
Take us to this box of yours.

916
01:00:22.125 --> 01:00:23.958
[laughing]

917
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.208
Like all beautiful things in this world.

918
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:29.542
Nidaros Cathedral's underbelly
is less flattering than its exterior.

919
01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:32.416
-Disserway!
-What the heck does "Disserway" mean?

920
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.375
It means "This way." Isaksen.

921
01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:35.916
Ah. should've known.

922
01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.666
I've often asked myself.

923
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.125
"If Olaf was so important to the Church.

924
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.750
why hide him down here?"

925
01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:46.958
Yeah. That is.
unless they had a disagreement.

926
01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:48.083
Olaf and the Church.

927
01:00:49.666 --> 01:00:52.875
Yeah. Why would you hide
something you're proud of?

928
01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:55.375
Right.

929
01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:59.500
People have poked and prodded down here
until they go wonky in the noggin

930
01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:01.083
and came up with diddly squat.

931
01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:04.000
but by all means. knock yourselves out.

932
01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.333
Where should we start?

933
01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.250
The same symbol from the cave. right?

934
01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:44.208
[Esther] Oh. yeah.

935
01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:47.125
When I found this room.
there was a real hullabaloo.

936
01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:50.125
Everyone thought we'd found the tomb.

937
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:54.083
Maybe he was here for a while
and then they moved his body?

938
01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.750
God only knows by whom or why.

939
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.375
Maybe it's time to get going?

940
01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:13.708
[Esther] Not much more to see.

941
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.250
That's the story.

942
01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:17.458
At least that's what we know so far.

943
01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:19.166

-[gasps]

944

-[clattering]

945
01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:29.208
Ah…

946
01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:38.708
-Step aside.
-Uh. sorry.

947
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:41.708
I swear I barely touched it.
I think it was already broken.

948
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.291
It's an easy fix.

949
01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.541
Step aside.

950
01:02:46.666 --> 01:02:47.833
Sorry.

951
01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:48.958
Huh?

952
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.958
A spear in the belly.

953
01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:58.083
This is…

954
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.291
[sighing] Oh…

955
01:03:01.541 --> 01:03:03.541
[cracking]

956
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:10.958
-They're his wounds.
-What do you mean. wounds?

957
01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:14.042
That's the spot where Olaf got stabbed
by Tore Hund and his gang

958
01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:15.708
during the Battle of Stiklestad.

959
01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:20.291
-First a chop in the thigh.
-[sword clangs]

960
01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.166
Then a spear in the belly.

961
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.166
[stabbing sound]

962
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.583
The final one…

963
01:03:28.458 --> 01:03:31.541
A sword… in the neck.

964
01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:32.583
[stabbing sound]

965
01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:33.916
[gasps]

966
01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.375
[sighs deeply]

967
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.833
There has to be something we can…

968
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.750
Here… let's try this.

969
01:04:02.916 --> 01:04:04.750
-[grunts]
-[clanking]

970
01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:08.833
[tense music plays]

971
01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:11.041
[Marion] Nora. Here.

972
01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:15.041
Yeah. first… first in the thigh.

973
01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:18.083
Then. a spear in the belly.

974
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
[clanking. ratcheting]

975
01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:23.166
Catch.

976
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.750
And then. a sword to the neck.

977
01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:30.916
[ratcheting. clanking]

978
01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:42.583
[cracking]

979
01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:44.041
[Andreas] Hey. hey. hey!

980
01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:47.625
I'll help you.

981
01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:48.750
[Nora] Okay.

982
01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.583
[cracking]

983
01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.125
[straining]

984
01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.458

-[gasping]
-[thudding]

988
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.916
The answer lies within the box.

989
01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.208
Staring you smack in the kisser.

990
01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:48.041
[soaring music rises]

991
01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.458
[Andreas] Look at all this water.

992
01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:58.791
[Nora] Maybe this is the Olaf Spring.

993
01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:17.291
[gasps softly]

994
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.708
-Okay.
-Wait!

995
01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:28.708
You can't just barge in and open it.

996
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.416
This is Olaf the Holy!

997
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.875
I mean. it… it might be.

998
01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:37.291
-We have to open it first.
-This is Olaf.

999
01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:39.208
Oh. I feel it.

1000
01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:42.458
Esther. I get it.

1001
01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:46.416
I respect… your respect here. I understand
the historic nature of this moment.

1002
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.833
For all we know.
this grave might give us the answers.

1003
01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.721
and already our time is running thin.

1004
01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:53.166
[Esther] Mm.

1005
01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:56.625
Yeah. alright. let's do it.

1006
01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:57.708
But…

1007
01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:01.541
Please respect the dead. for the Church.

1008
01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.666
Naturally. Of course we will.

1009
01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:08.666
[grunts]

1010
01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:11.666
[Esther] Oh.

1011
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:13.041
[inhales sharply]

1012
01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:19.166
[exclaims]

1013
01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:21.708
Look at my king.

1014
01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.833
Hey. good-lookin'.

1015
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.625
So. this is where you've been hiding?

1016
01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:37.833
You old rascal. you.

1017
01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:39.708
[Esther chuckles]

1018
01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:43.916
Huh? Well. that's strange…

1019
01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:47.375
-What's wrong?
-It's Bæsing.

1020
01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:49.541
Olaf's sword.

1021
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.541
Still intact. after so many years.

1022
01:07:54.583 --> 01:07:56.041
[Kris] It's silver.

1023
01:07:56.125 --> 01:07:58.916
Which we all know is
a useless material for weapons.

1024
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.875
It's too soft.

1025
01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:03.708
But still. all that aside. it won't rust.

1026
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:10.541
[Nora] What's this?

1027
01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:14.291
-Oh. careful. Take it easy.
-[Nora] Right.

1028
01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:23.333
No way. that can't be.

1029
01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:41.833
Time to call home.

1030
01:08:42.583 --> 01:08:44.875
Can you please hold it still
for just a second?

1031
01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:47.125
That's good. And down.

1032
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.333
Almost…

1033
01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:50.916
Got it.

1034
01:08:51.583 --> 01:08:52.791
[Sigrid chuckles]

1035
01:08:54.333 --> 01:08:57.650
Congrats. you just finished a quest
and leveled up to the final boss.

1036
01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:01.625
Look.

1037
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.208
"Trolls shall not
from this land be expelled."

1038
01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.833
-This changes everything.
-[Andreas] Hmm?

1039
01:09:15.583 --> 01:09:17.958
"For all injustices
inflicted upon the Jotun.

1040
01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.916
we hereby grant them their…

1041
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:21.458
"Home."

1042
01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:24.583
Jotunheimen.

1043
01:09:24.666 --> 01:09:26.458
So he wanted to give them a home.

1044
01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:27.958
Not eradicate them.

1045
01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:31.375
That's the reason.
They murdered him for it.

1046
01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:34.043
The Church wanted to continue
to eradicate the trolls.

1047
01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.208
That means Olaf isn't the target anymore.

1048
01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:44.708
He's going after
the backbone of our nation.

1049
01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:47.083
It's all of us.

1050
01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:49.500
[dramatic music plays]

1051
01:09:49.583 --> 01:09:53.458
Tragedy strikes again
as another troll attack shocks Norway.

1052
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:56.166
After unconfirmed reports.
it became clear yesterday

1053
01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.667
that a new giant monster is
on the loose in the country

1054
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.583
where Hemsedal was attacked.

1055
01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:04.333
Videos of the creature have circulated
widely on social media.

1056
01:10:04.416 --> 01:10:06.291
[woman recording] Aw. how cute!

1057
01:10:06.375 --> 01:10:08.500
-Viewer discretion is advised.
-[screaming]

1058
01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:11.375
How can the same shit happen
to the same country twice?

1059
01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.250
How many trolls do they have over there?

1060
01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:16.500
If they can fake a moon landing.
you bet they can fake that troll.

1061
01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:20.791
[in French] Images from Norway show
the destruction caused by the monster.

1062
01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:23.750
[in English] An unlucky couple in Lesja
had their house destroyed

1063
01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:25.416
by a troll for the second time.

1064
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.625
[in Filipino] There are reports
of loss of life…

1065
01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.583
[in Spanish] …both military and civilian.
Simply terrible.

1066
01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:32.750
[in English] The latest
observations place the…

1067
01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:36.333
…monster on the path towards
one of Norway's largest cities.

1068
01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:38.625
Trondheim was our capital
a thousand years ago.

1069
01:10:38.708 --> 01:10:42.166
Hm. Are we witnessing a troll king
attempting to reclaim his throne?

1070
01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.000
The Norwegian Army has so far failed
in their attempts to stop the creature.

1071
01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:48.792
[in Korean] The incident has sparked
an international outcry.

1072
01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.375
[in Russian] If this is
a threat to the motherland.

1073
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.416
we will take control of the situation.

1074
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.333
[in English] Is the country of Norway
about to be plunged back

1075
01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:58.416
into the Dark Ages?

1076
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.375
[cameras clicking]

1077
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:07.625
The surreal events over the last
24 hours have shocked us all.

1078
01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:11.500
We must also face the reality…

1079
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.708
That Trondheim is lost.

1080
01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:17.208
-[clamoring]
-Prime Minister!

1081
01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:19.500
What is the current strategy?

1082
01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:23.083
Currently. we're doing everything we can
to evacuate the people of Trondheim.

1083
01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.922
What's the strategy after Trondheim?

1084
01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:31.666
That… uh…

1085
01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:35.375
I will address that at a later time.
Thank you.

1086
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.083
-[clamoring fades]
-[general] We've exhausted our options.

1087
01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:42.125
The target broke our ranks and is set to
arrive in Trondheim in two hours. Major.

1088
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:45.583
We have deployed forces to evacuate
as many people as possible.

1089
01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:47.541
-Get out of there.
-[Kris] Copy that.

1090
01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:50.875
We can't leave now.

1091
01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:53.291
No way. Can't leave yet.

1092
01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.083
Okay. but Kris. if you…

1093
01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:56.958
Huh?

1094
01:11:57.041 --> 01:12:00.500
If we bail now. I couldn't sleep at night.
We can't let this happen.

1095
01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.625
Not a chance.

1096
01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.375
People…

1097
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:07.958
Good people. sacrificed their lives.

1098
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.375
We resist in their memory.

1099
01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.291
-Okay.
-Count me in.

1100
01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.333
Andreas…

1101
01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:23.833
You… maybe you should…

1102
01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:26.416
Yeah. you have a family to think about.

1103
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.125
That's why I can't go.

1104
01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.583
If Trondheim falls…

1105
01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:39.250
It won't stop here.

1106
01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.416
I'm staying.

1107
01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:48.625
Well. I live here.

1108
01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:51.916
Okay. but do we have a plan?

1109
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.750
Bullets and missiles have no effect.

1110
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:56.750
Church bells are effective to an extent.

1111
01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:59.000
-Uh. that…
-Do we know what Olaf did back then?

1112
01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.717
What weapons were used?
Other than sunshine. of course.

1113
01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:04.166
Bæsing.

1114
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:05.916
The silver sword?

1115
01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:07.541
Would silver work?

1116
01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.375
I guess.
I assume magic is infused in the silver.

1117
01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:13.291
The only thing magical about silver
is it won't corrode.

1118
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.403
-It can withstand water.
-[Kris] That's right.

1119
01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.625
Are we sure it's the silver?

1120
01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:24.166
Don't look at me.
I'm not following any of this.

1121
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:27.250
[pensive orchestral music playing]

1122
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.291
[sizzling]

1123
01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:44.750
[Nora gasping softly]

1124
01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:45.875
[cracking]

1125
01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:47.375
[gasps sharply]

1126
01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:49.333
-Holy water.
-Yeah.

1127
01:13:49.416 --> 01:13:53.125
That's what Olaf used on the sword.
Like the nursery rhyme.

1128
01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:54.791
Mm-hmm.

1129
01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:57.250
Okay. I gotta say.
first of all. that's crazy.

1130
01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:01.416
And second. there's not enough water
in that bird bath for this operation.

1131
01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:03.083
What do we do?

1132
01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:05.541
Well…

1133
01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:07.916
-Hm?
-[Esther scoffs]

1134
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.458
Are you guys joking right now?

1135
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.750
[Esther chuckles]

1136
01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:15.166
Inside that tomb. we've uncovered
one of the world's most mythical springs.

1137
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.208
-That's for sure.
-The Olaf Spring.

1138
01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:20.708
-We have ammo.
-We need people.

1139
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.291
Game on.

1140
01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.250
[siren whoops]

1141
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:26.625
[man on megaphone]
Trondheim is being evacuated!

1142
01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:28.666
Everyone on the buses!

1143
01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:37.541
Up here!

1144
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:44.333
People of Trondheim!

1145
01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:46.750
A storm is raging at the edge of the city.

1146
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.625
I understand how easy it is to run.

1147
01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:51.875
I promise you.
the sun that set over us all tonight...

1148
01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:54.167
Okay. there's a psycho-troll
right around the corner.

1149
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.542
We have no time to waste.
and our plan is insane!

1150
01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.416
Who will fight with us?

1151
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.416
Right here! I'm down!

1152
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.041
For Trondheim!

1153
01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:04.958
[shouts rising]

1154

1156
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.500
Great. thank you so much.

1157
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:28.416
Perfect!

1158
01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:33.333
Great work. guys!

1159
01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:50.625
[indistinct radio chatter]

1160
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.166
[man] Hurry up! Go!

1161
01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.333
Alright. everyone! The enemy's moving!

1162
01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:03.666
Keep up the pace! Faster. faster!

1163
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:06.000
[indistinct shouting]

1164

[music fades]

1165
01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:22.583
Yes. Siggy.

1166
01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:26.250
I promise. they put me on… bell duty.

1167
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:28.541
-Let me call you back. okay?
-[Sigrid] Okay.

1168
01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:41.541
So. what's your take… on faith?

1169
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:48.250
When my mother died.
I thought that if I could

1170
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:52.791
believe in all of it hard enough.
she would watch over me from up there.

1171
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:58.458
But… you can't force it.

1172
01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:00.541
You have to let faith happen. So…

1173
01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:04.041
I have faith she's watching.

1174
01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:08.416
I also have faith in you and your plan.

1175
01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.541
Although you are a little bonkers.

1176
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:15.708
We're standing together
because you're our captain.

1177
01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.125
It's because of you. really.

1178
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:31.666
What if we fail?

1179
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:37.666
It's always better to follow your heart
and fail than to go against your beliefs.

1180
01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:43.541
[exhales deeply]

1181
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.625
Yeah.

1182
01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.208
You're gonna be a great papa.

1183

1185
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.000

[overlapping shouts]

1188
01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:36.250
It has to work.

1189
01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:38.250
No plan B. right?

1190
01:18:39.875 --> 01:18:40.958
[sighs]

1191
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:53.500
Looks like you could use a fistful of Zen.

1192
01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:55.875
What?

1193
01:18:55.958 --> 01:18:58.291
I ordered your latest book and read it.

1194
01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:01.125
It was a real hoot.
You should write another.

1195
01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:02.541
[chuckles]

1196
01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:06.000
I'm afraid nobody's a fan of sequels.

1197
01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.166
Oh. that's a load of bull.

1198
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.666
Everyone loves a good sequel.

-Nora!
-He's killing him!

Our weapons have no effect.
His skin is bulletproof.

-His insides are vulnerable.
-Huh?

1253
01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:58.083
It has an internal ecosystem. A heart's
pumping everything through the body.

1254
01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:02.068
If we can get water inside the system so
it spreads. we can kill him from within.

1255
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.169
How do we do that?

1256
01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:06.875
[distant groan]

1257
01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:08.083
[rock clattering]

1258
01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:11.208
I have an idea. If we position
the helicopter right on top of him.

1259
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:13.625
we can drop the bomb
straight into his mouth!

1260
01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:16.458
Isaksen. you have seen
way too many movies.

1261
01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:18.541
[suspenseful music plays]

1262
01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:23.416
How… how many bombs are there?

1263
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.208
[groaning]

1264
01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:32.000
This is the last one.

1265
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.791
-Whatever we do. we do it now!
-Yeah.

1266
01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:44.000
Stall him. alright?

1267
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:47.916
Kris! I need a pilot!

1268
01:24:51.916 --> 01:24:53.916
[suspenseful music continues]

1269
01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:15.500
[rasping]

1270
01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:16.458
Ugh.

1271
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:24.125
Just curious.

1272
01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:27.416
what do you have in store to make
him look up and open his mouth?

1273
01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:30.791
Uh… let's get up there.
and I'll improvise a plan.

1274
01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:32.416
Great idea.

1275
01:25:42.083 --> 01:25:43.458
[weapon clicks]

1276
01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:51.333
-You seem lonely down here.
-More the merrier.

1277
01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:04.000
[inhales sharply]

1278
01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:05.833
No!

1279
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.750
-There goes the detonator!
-Huh?

1280
01:26:13.833 --> 01:26:15.500
I said we just lost the detonator!

1281
01:26:24.166 --> 01:26:26.333
-I have to take the chopper down.
-[strains]

1282
01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:29.041
Isaksen! The only way
to detonate it now is manually!

1283
01:26:29.625 --> 01:26:32.875
How do you do that?
Tell me how to do it manually.

1284
01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:36.042
You need an explosive.
Something like this would do the trick.

1285
01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:37.875
A hand grenade.

1286
01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:43.909
The problem is that the pin must be pulled
right before the bomb enters his mouth.

1287
01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.875
So then… someone has to jump with the bomb

1288
01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:49.583
and pull the pin on the way down?

1289
01:26:49.666 --> 01:26:50.666
Yeah!

1290
01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:10.333
[deep roar]

1291
01:27:14.291 --> 01:27:15.291
No.

1292
01:27:18.791 --> 01:27:20.125
No. no!

1293

[roars loudly]

1294
01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:31.333
Get us in position.

1295
01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:32.250
Isaksen.

1296
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:37.625
It's time to go.

1297
01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:40.291
-Nora?
-No!

1298
01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:43.750
Nora! Run!

1299
01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:44.833
Never!

1300
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:51.041
Kris. it's now or never!

1301
01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:53.125
This thing… it won't stop here!

1302
01:27:53.208 --> 01:27:54.375
It's up to us!

-Andreas.
-[Andreas] Hi. honey.

1310
01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:23.125
You went on a side quest?

1311
01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:25.333
No. no. it's like Spock says.

"The needs of the many…"

1313

Tell me you're joking.

1314
01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:33.458
We're in position.

1316
01:28:39.208 --> 01:28:40.958
