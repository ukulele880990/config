00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:52.487
{\an8}STRATEGY MEETING

3
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.612
Just when we thought damage to
the city would be inevitable

4
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.115
a powerful attack pulverized
that giant creature.

5
00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:59.286
So you're saying Centichoro
disappeared without a trace?

6
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.166
It's hard to believe. but this is
a feat only King could pull off.

7
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.127
We are incredibly lucky
to have King as our ally.

8
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.341
As for the Hero Hunter. I hear
Silverfang failed to capture him.

9
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.676
What do you plan to
do about this. Sitch?

10
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.637
If he continues to
hunt heroes like this

11
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.306
the Hero Association
will cease to function.

12
00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:25.103
You must no longer view Garou
as a human. but as a monster.

13
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:27.230
The next time he appears...

14
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.275
He will be categorized
as threat level Dragon

15
00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.652
and an emergency
alert must be issued.

16
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.321
But in reality. he's
still a human. right?

17
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.323
Could any normal person actually

18
00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.992
stand up to our Class-S
heroes barehanded?

19
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.452
Just think about it.

20
00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.621
Maybe the strategy's
the problem?

21
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:44.206
<i>"Our" Class-S heroes?</i>

22
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.291
<i>Even at this stage</i>

23
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.167
<i>he is treating this as
some kind of business.</i>

24
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:52.047
It was unexpected that Silverfang
failed to finish off Garou

25
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.758
but he did manage to leave
him severely injured.

26
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.012
At least this means Garou
likely won't bolster

27
00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.805
the Monster
Association's forces.

28
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.307
If nothing else. we can
count that as a win.

29
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.559
Get Blast over
here! Blast. I say!

30
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.479
He's a top-ranker. but he's not
doing anything at all. is he?

31
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.857
It's impossible to
give Blast orders.

32
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:15.070
He only operates as
a hero voluntarily.

33
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.366
He refuses to be bound by anyone
and dislikes drawing attention

34
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.077
so even in the registry.
his identity is undisclosed.

35
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:27.499
But that's because we believe he's
worthy of this special treatment.

36
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.253
However. if humanity
really needs help

37
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.130
I'm sure he'll take action.

38
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.881
What do you mean?!

39
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:39.386
That time is now! A
monster abducted my son!

40
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.348
It's been 24 hours since then.

41
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.724
Why haven't you attacked?

42
00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.436
I give you my word.
We will save your son.

43
00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.186
And you are...?

44
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.357
I'll be commanding
this rescue operation.

45
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.317
My name is Sekingal.

46
00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.653
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

47
00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.362
Huh?

48
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.991
What operation?

49
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:05.328
I'll just sweep in and take
care of things in no time.

50
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.372
Do we know where the hideout is?

51
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.667
Child Emperor is working at
full speed on it right now.

52
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.298
I have surveillance robots probing
Centichoro's underground route.

53
00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.885
But the area is huge...
we have three days. right?

54
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.052
We only have two days left.

55
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.472
Ugh... No sleep for me!

56
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:27.517
The hideout is somewhere in
City Z's ghost town. right?

57
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.813
Shall I just wipe it out?

58
00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:33.023
{\an8}KABOOM

59
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.023
We must tread carefully
since there is a hostage.

60
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.609
Sounds like a pain in the neck.

61
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.653
If they hadn't done that they'd
have no chance against me.

62
00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.531
The monsters must
be afraid of me.

63
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.534
The opponents are
pretty formidable.

64
00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.035
Yeah. whatever.

65
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.039
Did you call us here just
to give us that warning?

66
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:52.625
Actually yesterday...

67
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.337
Drive Knight forcibly continued
the investigation on his own.

68
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.217
He ignored our warnings and
entered the ghost town ahead of us.

69
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.093
Why would he go alone?!

70
00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:07.224
He's never lost a battle. so
he must've been confident.

71
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:08.851
But since last night

72
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.020
we haven't been able to pick up
a signal from his transmitter.

73
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.650
I think it's safe to assume that
Drive Knight has been defeated.

74
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.778
I don't care either way.

75
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.656
You'd better hurry up
and assemble your team.

76
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.199
Who's left?

77
00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:28.870
The Monster Association gave
us a three-day ultimatum.

78
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.247
We still have time.

79
00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:35.669
As soon as the other heroes are
ready. they will rush over too.

80
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.422
Still on standby?
What's going on?

81
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.217
A child is being held hostage?

82
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.178
You didn't know about
that. Atomic Samurai?

83
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.639
You also reek of blood.

84
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.518
Since yesterday. I've been
scouring mountains and caves

85
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:56.189
looking for hidden monsters and
slashing 'em up. left. and right.

86
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.776
Unfortunately. I
wasn't able to find

87
00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:00.902
the Monster Association's
hideout though.

88
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.487
Yeah. makes sense.

89
00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:06.157
I hear the Monster Association's
hideout is in the ghost town.

90
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.702
What?! We know that much?

91
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:12.706
Well. fighting head-on at the
hideout sounds easy enough.

92
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.667
I suggest we all get
some rest till then.

93
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.128
-Okay.
-I'm going to take a shower.

94
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.046
Oh my!

95
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.051
I heard the assault team would be
made up of an elite few. but...

96
00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.471
For some reason. there are some
here who don't fit the bill.

97
00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.432
This is not a picnic.

98
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:35.270
How about we refrain from bringing
our fun friends. Atomic Samurai?

99
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.940
I'd like the small fry to stick
to fighting other small fry.

100
00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.274
You got that?

101
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.903
It wouldn't be so
bad if they just die

102
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.466
but what if they're taken as
hostages or used as human shields?

103
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.490
That would be a major hassle.

104
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.576
If that ever happens

105
00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.329
can you give them the
orders to commit harakiri?

106
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.248
Hey. take it easy.
Mr. Handsome...

107
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:57.042
Amai Mask. are you on the team?

108
00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:02.714
Of course. Those monsters
interrupted my concert.

109
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.636
I see. My disciples
are tough. you know.

110
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:11.431
I'll tell them to protect
the pretty boy idol

111
00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.725
when he gets in trouble.

112
00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.685
So relax.

113
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.228
In trouble?

114
00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.106
I can't believe there are people

115
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.775
who still doubt my
combat abilities.

116
00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:25.654
I only stay in Class A because
it's easier to oversee everything.

117
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.697
I can move up to
Class S at any time.

118
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.492
Mm. let's see now.

119
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.244
To put it simply. so an
imbecile can understand...

120
00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.246
I'm stronger than you.

121
00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.667
Hm? Oh yeah?

122
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.252
<i>Master! Keep your cool!</i>

123
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:48.009
Warden. you sure I can just
walk right out the front door?

124
00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.929
This is an extra-legal measure.

125
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.389
Let me remind you that

126
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:56.101
every time you've broken out
of prison to do hero work

127
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.894
that's all been
illegal activity.

128
00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.689
I don't like how
the Hero Association

129
00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.233
gives a guy like you
preferential treatment.

130
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.443
But just this once. I
can't afford to say that.

131
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:10.490
There was a single
cat-like monster

132
00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.451
who turned some of the prisoners
into monsters and took them away.

133
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.288
Many officers who fought
back lost their lives.

134
00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.791
You're a hero out
there. aren't you?

135
00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.751
Isn't that right.
boss of the prisoners?

136
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.046
Get revenge for us!

137
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.090
Leave it to me.

138
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:31.011
I'll make them pay dearly

139
00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.096
for wrecking this
place while I was gone.

140
00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.640
Hang on. Boss!

141
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.143
I knitted a sweater for you.

142
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:39.978
Please wear it if you like.

143
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.027
Thank you. This will
give me courage.

144
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.779
Hey.

145
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.907
You mind leaving the room?

146
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.826
I can't focus with
you all staring at me.

147
00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.830
Metal Knight.

148
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.708
I know you're pretending not
to be there. Please answer.

149
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.960
<i>What...?</i>

150
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.255
I feel like I'm wasting
a lot of time and effort.

151
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.010
I'm sure you've figured out where
the hideout is by now. right?

152
00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.680
Please tell me. We're
running out of time.

153
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.681
Are you going to
let the hostage die?

154
00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:21.061
<i>By not telling you.
the hostage might die.</i>

155
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.479
<i>But if I do tell you</i>

156
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:26.149
<i>I bring death to not only the
hostage. but to all of you.</i>

157
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:30.445
<i>I will make a rational
choice based on justice.</i>

158
00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.698
There's another option.

159
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.741
You can join the operation.

160
00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.702
What are you so afraid of?

161
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.663
What is the state of your
machine body right now?

162
00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:44.542
If it has been destroyed. which
monster did that to you and how?

163
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.921
<i>Monster King Orochi.</i>

164
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.215
<i>It was just one strike.</i>

165
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.092
<i>The arm I used to guard
myself was destroyed.</i>

166
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.385
<i>Even the self-destruction
device was disabled.</i>

167
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.640
<i>It's not the Monster
Association I'm afraid of...</i>

168
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.142
<i>Evil powers are</i>

169
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.602
<i>watching for their chance
to take over the world.</i>

170
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.188
<i>When humanity's
defenses become weak</i>

171
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.273
<i>they'll strike all at
once to take everything.</i>

172
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.400
<i>Be careful.</i>

173
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.153
<i>Don't trust anyone around you.</i>

174
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.281
<i>If you want to enforce
justice do it alone.</i>

175
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.784
<i>Build up your strength...</i>

176
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.078
<i>And save it for the right
time. Child Emperor.</i>

177
00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.253
The Hero Association is useless.

178
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.546
Listen up. all of you!

179
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.089
Even as I speak

180
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.550
my son is trembling in
fear as he waits for help.

181
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.261
Head over to the abandoned
area of City Z immediately

182
00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.971
and find the Monsters' hideout!

183
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.722
And rescue my son!

184
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.850
The battle suits you are wearing

185
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:44.102
are secret weapons obtained
from special channels.

186
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.896
The performance of these suits

187
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.857
easily surpass the power
of any professional hero.

188
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:53.194
{\an8}NARINKI PRIVATE FORCE

189
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.109
Make full use of
your battle suits

190
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.236
and exterminate every single
monster you encounter.

191
00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.905
I'll pay whatever you
name for the success fee!

192
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.783
Bring back Waganma alive

193
00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.909
and you will live in luxury
for generations to come!

194
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.034
Go!!

195
00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.712
I'm pretty sure it's
that small building.

196
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.922
I got you cornered!

197
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.052
<i>The Blizzard Bunch
has been wiped out.</i>

198
00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.555
<i>Well. half of it is
my sister's fault.</i>

199
00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.932
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

200
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.352
<i>I need to use this
place as a branch office</i>

201
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.353
<i>of the Blizzard Bunch
to hold a meeting.</i>

202
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.146
Yes?

203
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.773
Saita... Wait. who are you?

204
00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.359
Oh? A friend?

205
00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.321
You have a visitor. Saitama!

206
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.992
Blizzard's here again.

207
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.703
Hey. how come the
monster I raised

208
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:46.122
died right away with just
a single hit of yours?

209
00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.291
What do you want.
Hellish Blizzard?

210
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.501
Master is not taking
any new disciples.

211
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.128
Sorry. it's so cramped.

212
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.839
Would you hand me that poultice?

213
00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.342
Why would wind be
earth's weakness?

214
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.928
But I'm at level 27 and
you're at level 15. you know.

215
00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.513
Even if you're at
the highest level

216
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.224
Old Man Golem can't
beat Meow-Meow types.

217
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.142
It's a weak character
to begin with.

218
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.311
What? You should've
told me that sooner!

219
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.605
-This Armpit character...
-That one's weak too.

220
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.233
Actually. only the cute
characters are strong.

221
00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.526
Oh. forget it. That
just ruined it for me.

222
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.320
<i>What is going on?</i>

223
00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.822
Hm? Why are you here?

224
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.157
It's an emergency.

225
00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.409
The Blizzard Bunch
got wiped out!

226
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.787
The Monster Organization
is extremely dangerous.

227
00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.914
This is no time to
be playing games.

228
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.416
Do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

229
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.669
You don't need to yell.

230
00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.881
I just got home a while ago
and was taking a short break.

231
00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.340
Don't lie down!

232
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:41.386
Just like Master said. we were
also facing some tough opponents.

233
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.429
Don't think you guys
were the only ones.

234
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.933
Yeah. I can tell from
the way you look.

235
00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:49.561
I know King was here before

236
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.647
but what's Silverfang
doing here now?

237
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:58.278
I fought alongside them. so
Saitama is letting me rest here.

238
00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.155
I got a little carried away

239
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.365
threw my back out.
and now I can't move.

240
00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:04.033
My knees gave out.

241
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:07.370
Using Fist of Roaring Qi. Rending
Air after so long took its toll.

242
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.957
I see. it must have
been quite a battle.

243
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.128
<i>Yet why? Why is this
guy the same as usual?</i>

244
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.589
Hey Saitama! You're
acting all cool and calm

245
00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.216
but you're actually
panicking. right?

246
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.217
Not really... it's
just the same as usual.

247
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.302
What?

248
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.762
There's no way this situation
is the same as usual!

249
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.889
Why is she getting mad?

250
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.934
I hate to break it to you

251
00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.019
but this situation is
not the same as usual.

252
00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.312
{\an8}BAM BAM

253
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:32.729
Come sit!

254
00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.481
We're going to have a
strategy meeting right now!

255
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.440
{\an8}BAM BAM

256
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.816
Seriously. why are you here?

257
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.569
Genos! You're Class S.

258
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.905
The Hero Association executives haven't
told you about their next moves?

259
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.743
I was supporting Master
Saitama yesterday

260
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.996
at a martial arts tournament
and also in a battle myself.

261
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.415
Not to mention. the
transmitter for the Association

262
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.125
got melted and was destroyed.

263
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.378
I dropped mine into a
crack in the ground.

264
00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.631
I noticed mine was broken too.

265
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:02.383
It might have been because of the
shock waves from Saitama's punch.

266
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.094
So what's our next move?

267
00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.679
We're on the brink of
war with the monsters.

268
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.931
I need to undergo
some repairs first.

269
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.017
Well. obviously.

270
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.727
We're gonna need time to recover

271
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.146
before we can get back
into action again.

272
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.814
You can't beat age.

273
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.149
What about you. King?

274
00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:21.069
I think there's some other
business I have to tend to...

275
00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:24.447
So Saitama and I are the only
ones who are ready to go.

276
00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:26.532
So what do you say?

277
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.868
Headquarters probably has
its own special task force

278
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.745
that's devising a plan.

279
00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.582
But at times like this. actions
taken by Class-B heroes and below

280
00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.834
can affect their
future evaluation.

281
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.170
So we should try to do
something to contribute.

282
00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:40.755
{\an8}DAZE

283
00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:40.796
Are you listening?

284
00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:42.716
This time. the enemy is

285
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.093
a large group of monsters
that usually act independently

286
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.637
but they have formed an
alliance which is unusual.

287
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.433
However. their
organizational structure

288
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.893
likely is more about
domination than cooperation

289
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.270
with a boss giving orders.

290
00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.065
Right. a monster group.

291
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:03.111
If Garou's joined up with
them. that's gonna be trouble.

292
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.949
Yeah. we may never get another
chance to fight Garou alone.

293
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.617
If they still have any monsters

294
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.370
as strong as that
centipede on their side

295
00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:13.453
it's not looking good.

296
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.832
Might as well quit
being a hero. Bang.

297
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.165
Saitama.

298
00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.586
Looks like the Hero Hunter
you've been wanting to meet

299
00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:20.753
was at that scene.

300
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.672
You just missed him.

301
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.968
On my way home. I heard that
he hunted down more heroes.

302
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.346
That's unforgivable.

303
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.224
Especially since he
hasn't come for me yet.

304
00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:34.767
Is it because I'm
the Caped Baldy?

305
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.770
-Saitama?
-Master?

306
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:38.980
I'm going out for a bit.

307
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.607
Do you know where Garou is?

308
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.109
I'm gonna look for him.

309
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.529
When I find Garou.
I'll punch him.

310
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.866
I'll also buy napa
cabbage on the way back.

311
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.831
<i>Here I was calling the shots. but
I'm left out in the cold again...</i>

312
00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.375
<i>Trying to get
Saitama and his crew</i>

313
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.419
<i>to join the Blizzard
Bunch will not be easy.</i>

314
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.518
<i>Where am I? Did I survive?</i>

315
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.228
<i>My memory is a bit fuzzy.</i>

316
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.481
<i>Welcome to the
Monster Association.</i>

317
00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.819
<i>The fact that you are reading
this means you survived.</i>

318
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:31.240
<i>Be aware that we are the
ones who saved your life.</i>

319
00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:35.244
<i>So wait quietly in this room
without causing any trouble.</i>

320
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:38.789
<i>Going outside right now will only
make you a target for heroes.</i>

321
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.917
<i>What you need is
a place to belong.</i>

322
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:44.212
<i>There's a change of clothes.
Please feel free to use them.</i>

323
00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:50.092
<i>Oww... It hurts like
hell!! My whole body!</i>

324
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.638
<i>I'm thirsty. And I need food...</i>

325
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.681
<i>...to replenish my blood.</i>

326
00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:03.314
<i>I was fighting the old man.
then that bird guy appeared...</i>

327
00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:06.150
<i>The Monster Association...
They get on my nerves.</i>

328
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.319
<i>What happened to the old man?</i>

329
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.279
<i>He was fighting
that centipede...</i>

330
00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.281
<i>Oh well. who cares...</i>

331
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:16.035
<i>The smell of blood
permeates the stagnant air.</i>

332
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.410
<i>Makes me wanna puke.</i>

333
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.373
<i>And it's so quiet.
my ears are ringing.</i>

334
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.417
<i>Am I deep underground?</i>

335
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.584
<i>Who cares...</i>

336
00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.132
Please have mercy!
We were wrong!

337
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.676
We'll never defy you ever again!

338
00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:34.012
Noo. I don't want to die!

339
00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:38.475
But you took out
two of my soldiers.

340
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.227
I can't just let you
walk out of here.

341
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:45.315
Your employer equipped
you with powerful gear

342
00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.191
so you'd better
fight till the end.

343
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:52.321
Everyone here just loves turning
anyone who resists into a plaything.

344
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.449
Grr... It's all his fault.

345
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.536
Dammit. If that freak
robot hadn't shown up

346
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.329
we could've escaped
to the surface.

347
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.498
Looks like the
advertising worked.

348
00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.333
Thanks for the gift.

349
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:07.378
I'm glad a capable new
recruit came to us.

350
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:09.338
You pass with flying colors.

351
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.882
What is your name. newbie?

352
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.094
I am Machine God G5.

353
00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:18.681
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
MACHINE GOD G5

354
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:18.681
I was deployed by the organization
to aid the Monster Association.

355
00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:20.016
"Organization"?

356
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.852
How did you get to this
hideout without getting lost?

357
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.687
Can I talk to your creator?

358
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.690
So be it. In any
case. we welcome you.

359
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.400
Besides. we have
another arrival anyway.

360
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.903
<i>Stay hidden and wait a
little longer. Garou.</i>

361
00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.949
<i>A voice directly in my
head! Is it telepathy?</i>

362
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:40.662
Having fought them
myself. I can say that

363
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:44.040
their battle suits have extremely
high combat capabilities

364
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.666
and are highly valuable.

365
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.253
However. they appear to be
customized for each individual.

366
00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:53.382
So no one else. let alone a
monster. would be able to use them.

367
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.553
In other words. we should let
them live and use them as pawns.

368
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.808
Then. you're mine.
I'll train you well.

369
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.770
Train? What on earth?

370
00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.396
Please just let us go!

371
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.148
Quiet!

372
00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:21.077
Excellent! I'm lucky to
have such promising slaves!

373
00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.923
Hey. Garou. You're up early.

374
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.800
-So that's the Hero Hunter.
-He got rescued...

375
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.677
-I like him.
-...and treated for his injuries.

376
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.680
Why did Gyoro-Gyoro take
interest in a mere human?

377
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:43.015
-Is he human? A monster?
-Silence!

378
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.643
I'm going to have an
important talk with him now.

379
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:48.354
<i>What the heck is that
giant in the back?</i>

380
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.815
What do you want me to do?

381
00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:54.944
After the recent battle. there
are fewer than 30 remaining

382
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.697
threat-level Demon or
higher monsters left.

383
00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.950
Even so. we are still
strong enough to win.

384
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:05.830
But what we lack right now
is unity... and a leader.

385
00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:10.167
I'd like you to become a member
of the leadership and assist me.

386
00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:12.169
A leader already?

387
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.587
That's a pretty sweet deal.

388
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.381
I was looking for someone

389
00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:20.094
with a strong anti-hero
ideology like him.

390
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.598
He's a lone wolf. but
even if he is battered

391
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:26.726
the way he goes for the
jugular against Class-S heroes

392
00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.018
is truly praiseworthy.

393
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:32.773
However. our boss. Lord
Orochi. has one condition.

394
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:36.986
Prove that you are
a true monster.

395
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.613
You want me to grow a horn?

396
00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.322
You have one day.

397
00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:43.826
I don't care who it is.
Bring me the head of a hero.

398
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.828
If it's a hero's
life you want...

399
00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.622
Hate to give you the bad news

400
00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.082
but Silverfang and
his buddies are alive.

401
00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.126
Centichoro was defeated.

402
00:20:56.547 --> 00:21:00.259
Sorry to bother you. I
have a favor to ask you.

403
00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.511
Hmph. what do you want?

404
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.511
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DEMON INSECT GOD

405
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.807
I want so badly to
hear a human scream.

406
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.392
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
KING THE RIPPER

407
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:08.267
I'm about to lose
my mind. Hurry up.

408
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.436
Garou went outside.

409
00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:12.605
Follow him.

410
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.575
Yesterday. it was Goketsu.

411
00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:50.160
And today. Centichoro
was defeated.

412
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:53.414
Yeah. I bet even Gyoro-Gyoro
didn't expect two top monsters

413
00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:55.499
to go down before
the decisive battle.

414
00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:57.919
Is that why he's trying to
recruit the Hero Hunter?

415
00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.628
So he can be one of
the key warriors?

416
00:22:59.837 --> 00:23:01.964
I can't read Gyoro-Gyoro.

417
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.216
Not like I'm
interested or anything.

418
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.636
As long as I can destroy the
Hero Association and Flash

419
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.719
I'm all good.

420
00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.013
We recruited

421
00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:11.348
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic but
what happened to him?

422
00:23:11.682 --> 00:23:12.975
I haven't seen him around.

423
00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:15.394
Maybe he couldn't adapt
to the monster cells.

424
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.444
I suffered all night. but
I think the worst is over.

425
00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:26.072
I hate those bastards from
the Monster Association.

426
00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:28.490
No one told me my stomach
would get this upset.

427
00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:30.075
I'll pay 'em back
for this one day.

428
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.244
Whatever.

429
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.415
I never had any intention of
teaming up with the monsters.

430
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.001
I just wanted to take
advantage of them.

431
00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:41.754
My only target is Saitama.

432
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.256
That being said...

433
00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:45.883
I can feel it... a new power.

434
00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:49.178
My body is definitely changing.

435
00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:51.347
My body feels light.

436
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.058
It may take a while
to get used to it.

437
00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.143
<i>So this is monsterization?</i>

438
00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:58.854
<i>Not that it's anything special.</i>
