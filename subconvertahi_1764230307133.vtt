2
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.674
I believe in America.

3
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.833
America has made my fortune.

4
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.953
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

5
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
I gave her freedom. but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

6
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.958
She found a boyfriend. not an Italian.

7
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.392
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

8
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.955
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.551
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

10
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.154
They made her drink whiskey

11
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.035
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

12
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.677
She resisted. she kept her honour.

13
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.156
So they beat her like an animal.

14
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.110
When I went to the hospital.
her nose was broken.

15
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.916
her jaw was shattered.
held together by wire.

16
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.070
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

17
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.759
But I wept. Why did I weep?

18
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.314
She was the light of my life.

19
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.956
Beautiful girl.

20
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.118
Now she will never be beautiful again.

21
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.196
Sorry.

22
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.314
I went to the police.
like a good American.

23
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.436
These two boys were brought to trial.

24
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.316
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison. but suspended the sentence.

25
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.958
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.751
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.272
Those two bastards. they smiled at me.

28
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.157
Then I said to my wife. "For justice.
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.118
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.599
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything. but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.549
What is that?

32
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.114
I want them dead.

33
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.278
That I cannot do.

34
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.756
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.353
I've known you many years. but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.519
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.989
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.910
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.635
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.912
I didn't want to get into trouble.

41
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.156
I understand.

42
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.598
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.431
You made a good living. had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.473
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.156
But now you come to me and say.

46
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.318
"Don Corleone. give me justice."

47
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.113
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.269
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.913
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.509
I ask you for justice.

51
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.393
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.279
Let them suffer. then. as she suffers.

53
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.513
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.794
Bonasera. Bonasera.

55
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.755
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.349
If you'd come in friendship.

57
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.509
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.477
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies. they'd be my enemies.

59
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.358
And then they would fear you.

60
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.029
Be my friend?

61
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.193
Godfather?

62
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.792
Good.

63
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.519
Some day. and that day may never
come. I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.273
But until that day...

65
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.358
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.233
- Grazie. Godfather.
- Prego.

67
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.669
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.756
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.839
We're not murderers.
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.197
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry. he'll be here.

71
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.233
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.193
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.396
Don Barzini.

74
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.957
Hey. Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.549
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.276
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.236
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.677
Sandra. watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.633
You watch yourself. all right?

80
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.639
20. 30 grand. In small bills. cash.

81
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.591
In that little silk purse.

82
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.236
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

83
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.714
Hey. Paulie!

84
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.674
Stupid jerk!

85
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.156
What's the matter?

86
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.115
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

87
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.871
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

88
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.153
Don Corleone. I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

89
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.913
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

90
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.438
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

91
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.836
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

92
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.913
Come here. come here. come here!

93
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.476
...but towards the end. he was paroled
to help with the American war effort.

94
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.433
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

95
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.710
Nazorine. what can I do for you?

96
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.990
Now that the war is over.

97
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.159
this boy. Enzo. they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

98
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.354
Godfather. I have a daughter.
You see. she and Enzo...

99
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.439
You want Enzo to stay in this country.
and your daughter to be married.

100
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.710
You understand everything.

101
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.074
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

102
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.708
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

103
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.639
The bride. the groom and the angel...

104
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.558
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our pais�.

105
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.880
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

106
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.516
Hey. Michael!

107
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.832
He's not on the list.
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

108
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.155
Is this necessary?

109
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.195
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding. so he wanted to thank you.

110
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.198
Don Corleone. I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

111
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.599
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

112
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.353
Michael...

113
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.791
That man over there
is talking to himself.

114
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.719
See that scary guy over there?

115
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.753
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

116
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.670
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

117
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.198
Michael. he's coming over here!

118
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.992
You look terrific!

119
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.397
My brother Tom Hagen.
Miss Kay Adams.

120
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.109
Your father's been asking for you.

121
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.198
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

122
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.313
Why does your brother
have a different name?

123
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.910
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

124
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.193
He had no home.
so my father took him in.

125
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.393
He's been with us ever since.

126
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.074
He's a good lawyer.

127
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.637
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

128
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.513
- What's that?
- That's a...

129
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.998
...Iike a counsellor. an advisor.
Very important for the family.

130
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.350
You like your lasagne?

131
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.596
Don Corleone.

132
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.075
I'm honoured and grateful

133
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.239
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.831
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

135
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.160
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

136
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.438
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

137
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.634
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you. Luca. Most valued friend.

138
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.039
Don Corleone. I'm going to leave you
now. because I know you're busy.

139
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.192
Thank you.

140
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.596
Signora Corleone!

141
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.472
No!

142
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.316
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming. but said you'd understand.

143
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.718
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

144
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.913
What is that outside?

145
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.558
Johnny! Johnny!

146
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.676
I love you!

147
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.550
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

148
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.912
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

149
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.636
Johnny. Johnny! Sing a song!

150
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.794
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

151
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.834
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

152
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.749
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

153
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.916
How?

154
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.831
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

155
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.910
Please. Michael. Tell me.

156
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.190
When Johnny was starting out. he was
signed to a personal service contract

157
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.868
with a big bandleader.

158
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.029
And as his career got better and better.
he wanted to get out of it.

159
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.708
Johnny is my father's godson.

160
00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.992
My father went to see this bandleader.

161
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.795
He offered him 10.000 dollars
to let Johnny go.

162
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.389
but the bandleader said no.

163
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.913
So the next day my father went to see
him. but this time with Luca Brasi.

164
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.591
Within an hour.

165
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.432
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1.000 dollars.

166
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.639
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

167
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.676
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head.

168
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.948
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

169
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.631
That's a true story.

170
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.472
That's my family. Kay. It's not me.

171
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.836
Beautiful!

172
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.436
I'll take care of it.

173
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.199
Tom...

174
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.399
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

175
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.836
How are you. Fredo?

176
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.396
My brother Fredo.
this is Kay Adams.

177
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.789
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

178
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.677
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

179
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.838
Yeah. This is your friend?

180
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.634
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

181
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.510
Anyway. if I had this part in the picture.
it puts me right back on top again.

182
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.874
But this... man won't give it to me.
the head of the studio.

183
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.072
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

184
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.552
He won't give it to me.
and he says there's no chance.

185
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.036
Sonny?

186
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.234
Sonny?

187
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.191
Sonny?

188
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.073
- Sonny. are you in there?
- What?

189
00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.679
The old man wants you.

190
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.911
One minute.

191
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.270
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book. a best-seller.

192
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.711
The main character
is a guy just like me.

193
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.639
I wouldn't even have to act.

194
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.435
Godfather. I don't know what to do.

195
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.513
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

196
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.919
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio. that cries like a woman?

197
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.113
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

198
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.992
Ridiculous.

199
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.317
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

200
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.953
Good.

201
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.109
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

202
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.156
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

203
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.354
Rest. and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

204
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.518
It's too late. they start shooting
in a week.

205
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.871
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

206
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.718
Just go outside and enjoy yourself.
and forget about all this nonsense.

207
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.358
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

208
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.229
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon. after they cut the cake.

209
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.830
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

210
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.114
Never. Give him a living. but never
discuss the family business with him.

211
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.754
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

212
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.351
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

213
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.358
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

214
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.998
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

215
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.471
If there's nothing else. I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

216
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.958
Carlo. we're going to take the picture.

217
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.717
Wait a minute.

218
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.388
No. Michael. Not me.

219
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.754
Okay. that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

220
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.315
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

221
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.159
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

222
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.670
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz.

223
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.394
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

224
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.750
Woltz is listening.

225
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.919
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

226
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.995
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

227
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.476
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

228
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.434
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

229
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.633
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen. you son-of-a-bitch!

230
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.277
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

231
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.678
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

232
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.475
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here. my Kraut-Mick friend.

233
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.878
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

234
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.038
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

235
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.553
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

236
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.397
By the way. I admire your pictures
very much.

237
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.710
Check him out.

238
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.080
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

239
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.558
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

240
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.320
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

241
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.433
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

242
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.438
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

243
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.677
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

244
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.553
You do appreciate beauty. don't you?

245
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.198
There you are.
600.000 dollars on four hoofs.

246
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.949
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

247
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.151
Khartoum.

248
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.032
Khartoum.

249
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.510
I'm not going to race him. though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

250
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.119
Thanks. Tony.

251
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.357
Let's get something to eat.

252
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.870
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

253
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.198
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred. close relationship.

254
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.793
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

255
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.675
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

256
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.829
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

257
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.475
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

258
00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.958
I'm going to run him out of the business.
and let me tell you why.

259
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.830
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable prot�g�s.

260
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.989
We trained her for five years.
Singing. acting. dancing lessons.

261
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.591
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her. to make her a big star.

262
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.234
Let me be even more frank.

263
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.116
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

264
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.710
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

265
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.869
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

266
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:12.950
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

267
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.628
And she runs off.

268
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.116
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

269
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.960
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

270
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.310
You get the hell out of here!

271
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.752
If that goombah tries any rough stuff.
tell him I'm no bandleader.

272
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.831
Yeah. I heard that story.

273
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.149
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

274
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.828
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

275
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.919
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

276
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.474
- You're not too tired. are you. Tom?
- No. I slept on the plane.

277
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.478
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

278
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.750
Now...

279
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.760
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife.

280
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.359
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

281
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.518
His business is narcotics.

282
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.712
He has fields in Turkey.
where they grow poppy.

283
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.674
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

284
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.316
He needs cash. he needs protection
from the police.

285
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.035
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

286
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.190
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

287
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.678
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy. one here.

288
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.348
He's known as a top narcotics man.

289
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.759
- Santino. what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

290
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.673
Tom?

291
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.634
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

292
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.231
If we don't get into it. somebody else
will. maybe the five families.

293
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.672
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

294
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.836
Then they come after us.

295
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.831
Now we have unions and gambling. and
that's great. but narcotics is the future.

296
00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.512
If we don't get a piece of that action.
we risk everything in ten years' time.

297
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.551
So? What's your answer
going to be. Pop?

298
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.355
Don Corleone.

299
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.871
I need a man who has powerful friends.

300
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.514
I need a million dollars in cash.

301
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.431
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket. like nickels and dimes.

302
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.434
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

303
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.599
In the first year your end should be
three. four million dollars.

304
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.394
And then it would go up.

305
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.036
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

306
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.029
My compliments.

307
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.633
I'll take care of them. out of my share.

308
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.391
So I receive 30 per cent for finance.

309
00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.751
political influence and legal protection?

310
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.520
That's right.

311
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.349
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

312
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.509
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance.

313
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.393
ti saluto. Don Corleone.

314
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.708
I said that I would see you. because
I heard you were a serious man.

315
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.115
to be treated with respect.

316
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.990
But. I must say no to you.

317
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.394
And I'll give you my reason.

318
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.479
It's true. I have a lot of friends in politics.

319
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.117
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling.

320
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.553
which they regard as a harmless vice.
but drugs is a dirty business.

321
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.151
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

322
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.388
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

323
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.479
If you're worried about security.
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

324
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.639
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

325
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.476
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children. and I spoil them.

326
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.229
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

327
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.389
Signor Sollozzo. my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

328
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.478
I know you'll do well. and good luck.

329
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.629
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

330
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.951
Santino.

331
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.513
Come here.

332
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:15.353
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

333
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.917
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

334
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.591
Go on.

335
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.438
Tom. what's this nonsense?

336
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.315
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

337
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.838
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

338
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.398
And...

339
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.839
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

340
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.396
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

341
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.239
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

342
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.880
Go to the Tattaglias.

343
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.039
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

344
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.198
and find out what you can.

345
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.391
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

346
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.071
and a tie for Freddy.
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

347
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.239
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

348
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.597
Andiamo. Fredo.

349
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.076
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay. Pop.

350
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.239
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

351
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.070
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

352
00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.071
Buon Natale. caro. Grazie.

353
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.198
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

354
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.754
You know who I am?

355
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.109
I know you.

356
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.316
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

357
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.116
I think you and I can do business.

358
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.069
I need someone strong like you.

359
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.636
I heard you are not happy...

360
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.956
...with the Corleone family.

361
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.550
Want to join me?

362
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.955
What's in it for me?

363
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.835
$50.000 to start with.

364
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.155
Not bad!

365
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.316
Agreed?

366
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.752
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

367
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.991
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

368
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.909
Make time. Consigliere. Get in the car.

369
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.351
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you. you'd be dead already.

370
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.118
Get in.

371
00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.428
- Fredo. I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay. Pop.

372
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.277
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

373
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.192
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

374
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.114
No.

375
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.632
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now. that's a thought.

376
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.238
Michael.

377
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.355
No. I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

378
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.354
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

379
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.837
- Sonny. it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

380
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.554
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

381
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.231
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad. Mikey.

382
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.437
- Are you there?
- Yeah. I'm here.

383
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.838
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

384
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.556
No. Look. come home. kid.
You should be with Mama. you hear?

385
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.596
Oh. my God.

386
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.512
Sonny!

387
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.836
Stay back there.

388
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.077
- Who is it?
- Open up. it's Clemenza.

389
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.872
There's more news about your old man.

390
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.674
Word is out that he's already dead.

391
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.350
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

392
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.632
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

393
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.274
- How often?
- Only three. four times.

394
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.029
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

395
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.472
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

396
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.275
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

397
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.833
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

398
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.035
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

399
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.959
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

400
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.391
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

401
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.717
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

402
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.311
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours. Sonny.

403
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.590
I'll wait.

404
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.393
Your boss is dead.

405
00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.349
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family. so don't be scared.

406
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.588
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

407
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.711
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

408
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.399
Drink it.

409
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.910
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

410
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.908
Sonny was hot for my deal. wasn't he?

411
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.669
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

412
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:58.238
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction. sure.

413
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.837
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

414
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.389
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

415
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.958
Let's face it. with all due respect.
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

416
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.756
Ten years ago.
could I have gotten to him?

417
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.471
Well. now he's dead. Tom.
and nothing can bring him back.

418
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:36.555
You've got to talk to Sonny. to the
Caporegimes. Tessio. fat Clemenza.

419
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.036
It's good business. Tom.

420
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.234
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

421
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.876
Yeah. well...

422
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.720
Let me worry about Luca.

423
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.431
You just talk to Sonny.

424
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.359
And the other two kids.

425
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.912
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

426
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.353
Now you can go.

427
00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.189
I don't like violence. Tom.
I'm a businessman.

428
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.038
Blood is a big expense.

429
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.556
He's still alive.

430
00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.309
They hit him with five shots.
and he's still alive!

431
00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.469
That's bad luck for me. and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

432
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.510
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

433
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:56.469
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo. Philip
Tattaglia. Bruno Tattaglia. Ramon...

434
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.473
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

435
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.513
If you get rid of Sollozzo.
everything falls into line.

436
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.871
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

437
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.309
If Luca sold out. we're in a lot of trouble.

438
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.115
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

439
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.871
- Hey. do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

440
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:25.756
Well. Tom. you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

441
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:31.956
If we lose the old man. we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

442
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:37.188
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

443
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.712
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

444
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.558
If your father dies...

445
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.352
...you make the deal.

446
00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:52.076
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

447
00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.715
What is it?

448
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.869
- Paulie. I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

449
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.231
Tessio. go see what it is.

450
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.950
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

451
00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.675
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

452
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.190
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

453
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.960
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

454
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.315
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

455
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.672
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

456
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.032
Mickey. tomorrow. get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

457
00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.028
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

458
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.629
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

459
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.475
Try Luca again.

460
00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.473
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

461
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.309
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

462
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.790
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

463
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.195
Probably late.

464
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.195
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

465
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.717
Rocco. sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

466
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.555
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

467
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.993
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

468
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.556
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

469
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.196
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

470
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.231
Watch the kids.

471
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:07.878
Paulie. go down 39th Street. pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

472
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.433
Yeah. all right.

473
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.872
Make sure they're clean. because
the guys will be there a long time.

474
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.039
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

475
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.949
Exterminate! Watch out.
so we don't exterminate you!

476
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.954
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

477
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.157
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

478
00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.598
Hey. Mike! Hey. Mikey!

479
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.997
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

480
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.355
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

481
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.595
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

482
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.472
He's going to make it.

483
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.076
I love you.

484
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.676
I love you!

485
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.909
- Michael?
- Yeah. I know.

486
00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.793
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

487
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.150
Can't you say it?

488
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.672
I'll see you tonight.

489
00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.438
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

490
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:20.033
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon. I'm going to die!

491
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.756
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

492
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.430
You start with a little oil.
then fry some garlic.

493
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.714
Throw in some tomatoes. tomato paste.
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

494
00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.835
You get it to a boil. you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

495
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.194
Add a little bit of wine.

496
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.072
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

497
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.353
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

498
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.472
You won't see him anymore.

499
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.319
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

500
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.751
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

501
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.997
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

502
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.794
- Be careful.
- Yes. sir.

503
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.156
Send somebody with him anyway.

504
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.397
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

505
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.998
No. Kay. There will be detectives there.
people from the press.

506
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.555
I'll wait in the cab.

507
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.438
I don't want you to get involved.

508
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.791
When will I see you again?

509
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.958
Go back to New Hampshire. and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

510
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:17.309
- When will I see you again. Michael?
- I don't know.

511
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.479
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

512
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.638
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

513
01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.513
What happened to the guards?

514
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.669
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

515
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.316
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

516
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.033
Get me Long Beach 45620. please.

517
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.358
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

518
01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.116
Sonny. I'm at the hospital.
I got here late. there's nobody here.

519
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.154
No Tessio's men. no detectives.
nobody. Papa's all alone.

520
01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.999
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

521
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.192
I'm sorry. but you will have to leave.

522
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:22.112
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

523
01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.676
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

524
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.839
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

525
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.076
Help me. please.

526
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.474
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo. the baker.

527
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.316
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

528
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.273
You'd better go.
there's going to be trouble.

529
01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.076
If there is trouble. I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

530
01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.716
Listen. Wait for me outside.
in front of the hospital. all right?

531
01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.956
I'll be out in a minute.

532
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.438
Just lie here. Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

533
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.670
I'm with you now.

534
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.638
I'm with you.

535
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.750
Get rid of these. Come here.

536
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.469
Put your hand in your pocket. like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

537
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.116
You did good.

538
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.317
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

539
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.559
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

540
01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.639
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

541
01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.551
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

542
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.118
- Phil. take him in!
- The kid's clean. Captain.

543
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:15.757
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

544
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.870
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

545
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.957
Stand him up straight.

546
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.915
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

547
01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.395
They're licensed to carry firearms.

548
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.435
If you interfere. you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

549
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.710
Let him go.

550
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.115
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

551
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.880
After the hospital thing. Sonny got mad.

552
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.992
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

553
01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.196
Jesus Christ.

554
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.438
Looks like a fortress around here.

555
01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.995
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

556
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.034
That Turk shows one hair on his ass.
he's dead.

557
01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.756
Mike. let me look at you.

558
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.517
You're beautiful. beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

559
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.919
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

560
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.839
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

561
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.192
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

562
01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.392
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

563
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.752
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

564
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.078
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

565
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.238
No more! Not this time. Consigliere.

566
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.512
No more meetings. discussions.
or Sollozzo tricks.

567
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.678
I want Sollozzo. or we go to war...

568
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.440
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

569
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.200
This is business. not personal!

570
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.871
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business. not personal.

571
01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.516
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

572
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.157
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

573
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.195
I found out about Captain McCluskey.
who broke Mike's jaw.

574
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.473
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll.
and for big money.

575
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.355
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

576
01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.030
So when Sollozzo is being guarded.
he's invulnerable.

577
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.676
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

578
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.398
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

579
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.229
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

580
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.632
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

581
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.110
All right. we'll wait.

582
01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.956
We can't wait. We can't wait.

583
01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.674
No matter what Sollozzo says.
he's going to kill Pop.

584
01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.509
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

585
01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.679
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

586
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.476
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

587
01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.396
They want to have a meeting
with me. right?

588
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.310
It will be me. McCluskey and Sollozzo.

589
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.394
Let's set the meeting.

590
01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.799
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

591
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.875
We insist it's a public place.
A bar. a restaurant.

592
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.914
Some place where there are people.
so I feel safe.

593
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.913
They'll search me when I meet them.
right?

594
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.873
So I can't have a weapon on me.

595
01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:03.799
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

596
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.799
...then I'll kill them both.

597
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.516
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

598
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.110
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

599
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.475
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

600
01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.319
You're taking this very personal.

601
01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.717
Tom. this is business
and he's taking it personal.

602
01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.515
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

603
01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:52.909
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs. a dishonest cop.

604
01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.954
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

605
01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.314
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll. right?

606
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.999
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

607
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.949
It's not personal. Sonny.
It's strictly business.

608
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.629
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace. so you don't worry about prints.

609
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.277
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

610
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.039
Is the trigger too tight?

611
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.994
My ears!

612
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.399
I left it noisy. so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

613
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.592
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

614
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.948
- Sit down. finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

615
01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.470
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

616
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.719
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face.

617
01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.639
so walk out fast. but don't run.

618
01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.116
Don't look anybody in the eye.
but don't look away either.

619
01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.471
They'll be scared stiff.
so don't worry about nothing.

620
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.519
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation.
nobody knows where.

621
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.075
and we'll catch the hell.

622
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.829
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

623
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.510
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

624
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.510
These things have to happen every five.
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

625
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.713
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

626
01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.790
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich. not letting him get away with it.

627
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.792
You know. Mike. we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

628
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.389
Your father too.

629
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.470
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

630
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.473
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

631
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.433
How much time do we have?

632
01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.589
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

633
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.638
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

634
01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.551
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

635
01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.629
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

636
01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.150
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

637
01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.830
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

638
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.157
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car. Sonny!

639
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.396
I'll get it.

640
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.831
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

641
01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.032
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

642
01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.758
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

643
01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.590
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure. I do. It's perfect for us.

644
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.590
A small family place. good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

645
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:05.591
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know. the box and the chain thing.

646
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.554
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

647
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.117
All right. Mike. you go to the restaurant.

648
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.995
you eat. talk for a while. you relax.
Make them relax.

649
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.990
Then you go to take a leak. No. better
still. you ask permission to go.

650
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.716
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

651
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.549
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

652
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.638
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

653
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.278
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

654
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.869
Let's move.

655
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.278
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

656
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.630
Yeah. a million times.

657
01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.549
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

658
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.999
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

659
01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.430
At least a year.

660
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.589
I'll square it with Mom. that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

661
01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.075
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

662
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.990
Take care.

663
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.270
Take care. Mike.

664
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.953
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

665
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.551
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

666
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.038
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

667
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.028
I swear on my children
that he won't be. Mike.

668
01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.357
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

669
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.873
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

670
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.389
He's a good kid.

671
01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.236
I'm sorry about the other night. Mike.

672
01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.389
I've got to frisk you. so turn around.
On your knees. facing me.

673
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.989
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

674
01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.759
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

675
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.553
He's clean.

676
01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.075
Going to Jersey?

677
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.669
Maybe.

678
01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.554
Nice work. Lou.

679
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.639
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

680
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.274
I'll have it.

681
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.836
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

682
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.360
What I want...

683
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.994
What's most important to me...

684
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.352
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

685
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.519
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

686
01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.030
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me. kid.

687
01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.356
I'm not that clever.

688
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.955
All I want is a truce.

689
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.829
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

690
01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.112
When you got to go. you got to go.

691
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.359
He's clean.

692
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.358
Don't take too long.

693
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.636
I've frisked a thousand punks.

694
01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.390
Okay. you take over.

695
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.558
I love you. Grandpa.

696
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.271
I'm sorry. Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

697
01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.998
- Hey. big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

698
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:45.150
"I hope you get well. Grandpa. and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

699
01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:50.236
Go with your mother.

700
01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.795
Take them downstairs.

701
01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:00.669
Go on. Carlo. you too.

702
01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.478
Go on.

703
01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.919
- What's the matter with you. Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

704
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:47.989
Since McCluskey's killing. the police
have cracked down on our operations.

705
01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:54.195
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

706
01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:57.676
They hit us. so we hit them back.

707
01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.551
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

708
01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.833
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

709
01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.110
So things are loosening up.

710
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:17.395
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas. under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

711
01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.118
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

712
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.076
Where's Michael?

713
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.878
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

714
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.118
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

715
01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.717
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

716
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.878
Sonny. things are starting to loosen up.

717
01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.676
If you go after Tattaglia. all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

718
01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:30.398
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

719
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.275
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

720
01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.235
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

721
01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.878
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!

722
01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.038
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

723
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.834
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

724
01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.957
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

725
01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:01.872
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

726
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.834
Driving new Cadillacs.
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

727
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.998
That's because they've started
making big money.

728
01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.476
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

729
01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.958
- Shut up. Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

730
01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.879
Don't interfere.

731
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.039
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

732
01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.959
We don't discuss business at the table.

733
01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.719
I kiss your hand. Don Tommasino.

734
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.231
Why are you so far
from the house?

735
01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.079
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

736
01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.271
The bodyguards are here.

737
01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.710
It's still dangerous...

738
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.480
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

739
01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.797
Your enemies know you're here.

740
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.072
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

741
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.872
Not yet.

742
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.833
It's out of the question.

743
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.875
Where are you going now?

744
01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.348
Take my car.

745
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.074
I want to walk.

746
01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.313
Be careful.

747
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.472
Where have all the men gone?

748
01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:37.433
They're all dead from vendettas.

749
01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.477
There are the names of the dead.

750
01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.389
Hey. hey. take me to the America. G.I.!

751
01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.189
Hey. hey. take me to the America. G.I.!
Clark Gable!

752
01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:10.233
America! Take me to the America. G.I.!
Clark Gable. Rita Hayworth!

753
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.715
Mamma mia what a beauty.

754
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.474
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

755
01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.268
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

756
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.510
Did you have a good hunt?

757
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.188
You know all the girls
around here?

758
01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.834
We saw some real beauties.

759
01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.999
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

760
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.073
She would tempt the devil himself.

761
01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.834
Really put together.

762
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:45.115
Such hair. such mouth!

763
01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.476
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

764
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.069
This one had a purple dress...

765
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.714
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

766
01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.913
A type more Greek than Italian.

767
01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.716
Do you know her?

768
01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.472
There's no girl like that
in this town.

769
01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.075
My God. I understand!

770
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.389
What's wrong?

771
01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.238
Let's go.

772
01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.753
It's his daughter.

773
01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.269
Tell him to come here.

774
01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.917
Call him.

775
01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.680
Fabrizio. you translate.

776
01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.998
I apologise if I offended you.

777
01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.033
I'm a stranger in this country.

778
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.516
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

779
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.114
I'm an American. hiding in Sicily.

780
01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.239
My name is Michael Corleone.

781
01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.679
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

782
01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.916
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

783
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.959
...instead of gaining a husband.

784
01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.993
I want to meet your daughter.

785
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.591
With your permission. and under
the supervision of your family.

786
01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.873
With all respect.

787
01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.879
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

788
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.476
What's her name?

789
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.748
I'll knock you dizzy.

790
01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.189
Save it for the library.

791
01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.113
We've got to pick up my sister.

792
01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.754
What's the matter?

793
01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.958
What's the matter?

794
01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:37.029
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

795
01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.879
It was my fault. I hit him.

796
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.437
I started a fight with him.
I hit him. so he hit me...

797
01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.509
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

798
01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.678
Sonny. please don't do anything.

799
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.838
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

800
01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.838
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

801
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.958
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

802
01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:11.357
Tell them to stop taking in action.

803
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.516
We lost enough money last week.

804
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.116
Come here. come here!

805
01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.712
If you touch my sister again. I'll kill you.

806
01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.479
Hey! We weren't expecting you. Kay.
You should call.

807
01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:11.673
Yes. I have. I've tried writing and calling.

808
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:15.475
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

809
01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.638
All we know is that he's all right.

810
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.359
- What was that?
- An accident. but nobody was hurt.

811
01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:30.349
Tom. will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

812
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:35.833
If I accepted that. a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

813
01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.235
He'll get in touch with you.

814
01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:41.830
I let my cab go. so can I call
another one. please?

815
01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.996
Come on. Sorry.

816
01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.398
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

817
01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.830
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

818
01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.476
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

819
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.597
Bitch!

820
01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.635
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

821
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:25.832
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

822
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.315
You just told me to make you dinner!

823
01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:39.039
She has a filthy mouth. this Guinea brat.

824
01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.079
That's it. break it all. you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

825
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.430
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

826
01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.793
Maybe I will.

827
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:10.798
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

828
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.039
You skinny. spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

829
01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.915
Clean it up! I said. clean it up!
Clean it up!

830
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.551
Clean it up. Clean that up. you...

831
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.837
Clean it!

832
01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.999
Clean it up! Yeah. kill me.
Be a murderer. like your father!

833
01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.476
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

834
01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:39.399
Come on. kill me!

835
01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.192
Get out of here!

836
01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.472
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

837
01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:47.638
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

838
01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.590
Connie. what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

839
01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.038
Connie. talk louder. The baby's crying.

840
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.596
Santino. I can't understand.
I don't know.

841
01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.475
Yeah. Connie.

842
01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:16.676
You wait there.

843
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.314
No. you just wait there.

844
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.749
Son-of-a-bitch.

845
01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:28.872
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

846
01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:35.956
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

847
01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.792
Sonny!

848
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.240
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

849
01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.636
Go after him. go on!

850
01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:27.310
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

851
01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.116
Give me a drop.

852
01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.878
My wife is crying upstairs.

853
01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.477
I hear cars coming to the house.

854
01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.078
Consigliere of mine.

855
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:37.511
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

856
01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:40.188
I didn't tell Mama anything.

857
01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:44.549
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

858
01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.390
But you needed a drink first.

859
01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.552
Yeah.

860
01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:58.758
Well. now you've had your drink.

861
01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.952
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

862
01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.879
I want no inquiries made.

863
01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.239
I want no acts of vengeance.

864
01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.994
I want you to arrange a meeting...

865
01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:41.158
...with the heads of the five families.

866
01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:45.074
This war stops now.

867
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.835
Call Bonasera.

868
01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.469
I need him now.

869
01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.835
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone. at his request.

870
01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.349
You owe your Don a service.

871
01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.836
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

872
01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.750
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

873
01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:02.110
Well. my friend. are you ready
to do me this service?

874
01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.279
Yes. What do you want me to do?

875
01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.035
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

876
01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:24.551
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

877
01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:42.752
Look how they massacred my boy.

878
01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:13.636
It's safer to teach you English!

879
01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.353
I know English...

880
01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:20.509
Monday. Tuesday. Thursday.
Wednesday. Friday. Sunday. Saturday.

881
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.029
Greetings. Don Tommasino.

882
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.800
How are things in Palermo?

883
01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:43.153
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch. I'll show you.

884
01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:46.354
How are things in Palermo?

885
01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:49.313
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

886
01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:52.876
times are changing for the worse.

887
01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:01.038
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

888
01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:08.271
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

889
01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:13.794
What's wrong?

890
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.998
Bad news from America.

891
01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:22.959
Your brother. Santino.
they killed him.

892
01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.751
Let's go...you promised.

893
01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:51.314
Get the car.

894
01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:55.913
Are you driving yourself. Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

895
01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:59.510
No. take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

896
01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:02.029
Okay. anything you say.

897
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.755
Calo. where is Apollonia?

898
02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:13.919
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

899
02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:18.438
She'll make a good American wife.

900
02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.355
Wait. I'll get the baggage.

901
02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:33.035
Fabrizio!

902
02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.674
Where are you going?

903
02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:40.035
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

904
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:45.719
No. Apollonia!

905
02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:13.478
Don Barzini. I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting.

906
02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:18.754
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

907
02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:22.878
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

908
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.470
and from Brooklyn...

909
02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:30.030
...Philip Tattaglia.

910
02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:34.153
And from Staten Island

911
02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.591
we have with us Victor Strachi.

912
02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:43.272
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

913
02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:47.393
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

914
02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:56.477
How did things ever get so far?

915
02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:58.636
I don't know.

916
02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.358
It was so unfortunate. so unnecessary.

917
02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:10.275
Tattaglia lost a son. and I lost a son.

918
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.556
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees.

919
02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:19.548
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

920
02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.236
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

921
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:29.355
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

922
02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:33.314
Yes. Don Barzini. He's too modest.

923
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:36.717
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

924
02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:40.598
He refused to share them.

925
02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:44.156
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

926
02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.794
All of you know me.

927
02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.600
When did I ever refuse.
except one time? And why?

928
02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:59.592
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

929
02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.509
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women.

930
02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:09.511
which is something that most people
want. but is forbidden by the Church.

931
02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:14.191
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

932
02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:18.279
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

933
02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:23.270
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

934
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.471
Times have changed.

935
02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:30.151
It's not like the old days.
when we could do anything we wanted.

936
02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.999
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

937
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:38.354
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians. then he must share them

938
02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:43.190
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

939
02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.236
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

940
02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.238
After all. we're not communists.

941
02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:55.678
I also don't believe in drugs.

942
02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.476
For years I paid my people extra. so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

943
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.638
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

944
02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:10.678
"If you put up 3-4.000 dollar investment.
we can make 50.000 distributing."

945
02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:16.432
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business. keep it respectable.

946
02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:21.350
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

947
02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.233
That's an inf�mia.

948
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:28.069
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

949
02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:31.238
They're animals.
so let them lose their souls.

950
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:41.639
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

951
02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:49.158
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

952
02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:53.672
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted. but controlled.

953
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:58.078
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east. and there will be peace.

954
02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:01.511
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

955
02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.030
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger.

956
02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:07.595
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

957
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:12.749
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

958
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:15.076
You talk about vengeance.

959
02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.238
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

960
02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:21.079
Or my boy to me?

961
02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:24.238
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

962
02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:29.438
But I have selfish reasons.

963
02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:34.839
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

964
02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.998
...because of this Sollozzo business.

965
02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:43.796
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

966
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.594
Cleared of all these false charges.

967
02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:50.832
But I'm a superstitious man.

968
02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:57.229
If an unlucky accident should befall him.
if he should be shot by a police officer.

969
02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:00.750
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell.

970
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:04.714
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning.

971
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:08.879
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

972
02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:12.519
And that I do not forgive.

973
02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.068
But. that aside...

974
02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.353
...Iet me say that I swear...

975
02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:26.518
...on the souls of my grandchildren.

976
02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:31.396
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

977
02:06:55.240 --> 02:07:00.473
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

978
02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:03.399
Mention it. Don't insist.

979
02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:09.475
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

980
02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:16.119
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

981
02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:25.150
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

982
02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:41.230
Come on. Nancy.

983
02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:45.437
Keep together. everyone. Brian.

984
02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.276
Okay. all right.

985
02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.068
How long have you been back?

986
02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.236
I've been back a year.

987
02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:09.119
Longer than that. I think.

988
02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.235
It's good to see you. Kay.

989
02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:26.598
I'm working for my father now. Kay.

990
02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:31.757
He's been sick. Very sick.

991
02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:39.149
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

992
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:44.518
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

993
02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:48.952
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

994
02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:51.276
Like a senator or president.

995
02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.835
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

996
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.759
They don't have men killed.

997
02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:01.715
Who's being naive. Kay?

998
02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:08.193
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

999
02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.349
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1000
02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.597
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1001
02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:22.869
Michael. why did you come here? Why?

1002
02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:28.231
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1003
02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:31.671
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1004
02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.317
- Please stop it. Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1005
02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.152
- It's too late.
- Please. Kay...

1006
02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.279
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

1007
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.279
Because that's important. Kay.
Because what's important is that...

1008
02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:56.792
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1009
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.197
That we have children. Our children.

1010
02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:04.033
Kay. I need you.

1011
02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.395
And I love you.

1012
02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.435
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1013
02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.950
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1014
02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.118
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1015
02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.232
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1016
02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.671
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1017
02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:49.715
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike. you're wrong.

1018
02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.512
Don Corleone...

1019
02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.992
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1020
02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:00.352
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1021
02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:03.472
Michael is now head of the family.

1022
02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.673
If he gives his permission.
then you have my blessing.

1023
02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:09.836
After we make the move to Nevada

1024
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.352
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1025
02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.519
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1026
02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:24.556
Forgive me. but with you gone. me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

1027
02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:29.993
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1028
02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.033
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

1029
02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:35.913
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always. Godfather.

1030
02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:39.396
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1031
02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.913
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1032
02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.918
That's all I can tell you now.

1033
02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:54.315
Carlo. you grew up in Nevada.

1034
02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.751
When we make our move there.
you'll be my right-hand man.

1035
02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.431
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1036
02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:05.950
That's no reflection on Tom.
just how I want it.

1037
02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.836
If I ever need help. who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1038
02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.830
- Thank you. Poppa.
- I'm happy for you. Carlo.

1039
02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.512
Mike... Why am I out?

1040
02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.515
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

1041
02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:43.314
Things may get rough with the move.

1042
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:46.110
Tom.

1043
02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:54.989
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1044
02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:00.354
I thought Santino was a bad Don.
rest in peace.

1045
02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:04.473
Michael has all my confidence.
just as you do.

1046
02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:09.913
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1047
02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:13.590
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out. Tom.

1048
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:04.519
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1049
02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.998
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey. hey. hey!

1050
02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.431
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1051
02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:15.029
Let me open the door. all right?

1052
02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:26.832
- Hello. Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you. kid! It's all his idea.

1053
02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.679
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1054
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.395
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1055
02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:41.438
- Anything you want. kid. anything.
- Who are the girls?

1056
02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.599
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them. Fredo.

1057
02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:50.951
- Hey. Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1058
02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:54.311
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1059
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:02.238
Hey. take off. Take off. Let's go.

1060
02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:05.398
Hey. that's it. Hey. Angelo.

1061
02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:08.549
Hey. come on! Scram!

1062
02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:14.078
Come on. honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him. Johnny.

1063
02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.271
Sorry.

1064
02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:19.074
I don't know. He's tired.

1065
02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.438
What happened to Moe Greene?

1066
02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:32.838
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1067
02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:35.270
Well. give him a call.

1068
02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:39.277
- Johnny. how are you?
- Nice to see you. Mike.

1069
02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:41.436
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1070
02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:44.916
Sit down. I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1071
02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:47.714
Well. I owe it all to him.

1072
02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:52.789
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

1073
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.719
Mike. what can I do?

1074
02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:01.711
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

1075
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:07.552
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel. so we'll own all of it. Tom!

1076
02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.595
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1077
02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:15.951
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1078
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:18.950
See. Johnny...

1079
02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:23.199
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1080
02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:27.359
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1081
02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.355
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1082
02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:37.515
We're counting on you.

1083
02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:42.949
Sure. Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

1084
02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.559
Good.

1085
02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:50.157
Hey. Mike! Hello. fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy. Tom.

1086
02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:52.316
- Good to see you.
- How are you. Moe?

1087
02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:57.469
Have everything? Specially prepared
food. the best dancers. and good credit.

1088
02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.468
Draw chips for everybody.
so they can play on the house.

1089
02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.512
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1090
02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:09.199
Buy me out?

1091
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.599
The casino. the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1092
02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:20.399
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No. I buy you out.

1093
02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:23.592
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1094
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:28.237
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1095
02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:34.589
You Guineas make me laugh.

1096
02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:39.999
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time. and now you try to push me out!

1097
02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.795
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

1098
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.790
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1099
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.949
Yes. First of all. you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

1100
02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:58.312
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1101
02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.069
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1102
02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.990
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1103
02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:10.431
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1104
02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:15.191
That was nothing. Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1105
02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.359
He flies off the handle sometimes.
but we're good friends.

1106
02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:23.872
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1107
02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:27.789
We had an argument.
so I had to straighten him out.

1108
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.434
You straightened my brother out?

1109
02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:34.918
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1110
02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.395
What's wrong with you?

1111
02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:45.115
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1112
02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:46.753
Son-of-a-bitch!

1113
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:52.080
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1114
02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:55.477
Wait a minute. Moe. I have an idea.

1115
02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:59.036
Tom. you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1116
02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:04.075
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1117
02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.875
If you have anything to say.
say it to Michael.

1118
02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.160
Mike. you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1119
02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:19.636
Fredo...

1120
02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:22.798
You're my older brother. and I love you.

1121
02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:28.237
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1122
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.437
I have to see my father and his people.
so have dinner without me.

1123
02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:48.760
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city. see a show and have dinner.

1124
02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:58.198
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1125
02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:00.470
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1126
02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:03.240
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1127
02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:05.396
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1128
02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:07.955
Let me think about it. Come on.

1129
02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:18.718
Barzini will move against you first.

1130
02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:23.118
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1131
02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:26.153
Guaranteeing your safety.

1132
02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:29.716
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1133
02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:37.110
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1134
02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:41.748
- Anyway. I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you. Pop.

1135
02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.515
I don't know.

1136
02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:52.995
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1137
02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:56.556
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1138
02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:02.430
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1139
02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:05.996
- No. not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1140
02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:09.911
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1141
02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:14.948
Women and children can be careless.
but not men.

1142
02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:19.870
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1143
02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:22.913
He looks more like you every day.

1144
02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:29.632
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1145
02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:33.750
Read the funny papers.

1146
02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:45.792
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1147
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.757
- I did it already. I took care of that. Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1148
02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.480
What's the matter?

1149
02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:00.035
What's bothering you?

1150
02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:07.351
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it.
so I'll handle it.

1151
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.959
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

1152
02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:27.038
And Fredo...

1153
02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:30.750
Fredo was. well...

1154
02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:35.636
But I never wanted this for you.

1155
02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:41.949
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

1156
02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:45.869
And I refused to be a fool.

1157
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:50.232
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1158
02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:55.759
I don't apologise. That's my life.
but I thought that...

1159
02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:01.913
...that when it was your time. you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1160
02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:08.759
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1161
02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.269
Another pezzo da novanta.

1162
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.399
Well...

1163
02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:20.319
Just wasn't enough time. Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1164
02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:24.195
We'll get there. Pop. We'll get there.

1165
02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:32.632
Now listen. whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting.

1166
02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:36.116
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1167
02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:54.189
Can I hold it. please?

1168
02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:12.069
- Can I water these?
- Yes. go ahead.

1169
02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:15.272
Over here. over here.

1170
02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:19.917
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1171
02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:27.196
Antony!

1172
02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:29.391
Come here. come here.

1173
02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:35.639
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1174
02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:44.391
I'll show you something. Come here.

1175
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:47.556
Stand there.

1176
02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:53.229
Give me an orange!

1177
02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.511
That's a new trick.

1178
02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:15.958
You run in there. Run in there.

1179
02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:30.350
Where are you?

1180
02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:23.238
Mike. can I have a minute?

1181
02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:34.515
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1182
02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:38.508
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1183
02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:41.712
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1184
02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:46.311
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1185
02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:51.592
- All right?
- All right.

1186
02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:10.878
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

1187
02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:17.392
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1188
02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:20.750
Where I'll be safe.

1189
02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:35.669
I always thought it would be
Clemenza. not Tessio.

1190
02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:40.192
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1191
02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.991
But I'm going to wait.

1192
02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:46.395
After the baptism.

1193
02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:50.759
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1194
02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:54.632
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

1195
02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:59.675
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

1196
02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:19.473
Michael. do you believe in God. the
Father. Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1197
02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:20.954
I do.

1198
02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:24.391
Do you believe in Jesus Christ.
His only Son. our Lord?

1199
02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:25.874
I do.

1200
02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:29.834
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost.
the Holy Catholic Church?

1201
02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.314
I do.

1202
02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:38.071
Michael Francis Rizzi.
do you renounce Satan?

1203
02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:45.354
I do renounce him.

1204
02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:56.079
And all his works?

1205
02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:10.353
I do renounce them.

1206
02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:13.159
Oh. God!

1207
02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:19.555
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1208
02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:38.149
Michael Rizzi. will you be baptised?

1209
02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:39.793
I will.

1210
02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:52.550
Michael Rizzi. go in peace. and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

1211
02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:07.236
Kay!

1212
02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:09.431
Kiss your godfather.

1213
02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:38.157
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

1214
02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:41.557
- Mike. it's our first vacation!
- Connie. please.

1215
02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:45.719
Go back to the house. wait for my call.
It's important.

1216
02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:48.195
I'll only be a couple of days.

1217
02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:06.433
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1218
02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:11.992
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1219
02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:23.960
Sal. Tom. the boss says he'll come in a
separate car. so you two go on ahead.

1220
02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.596
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1221
02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:30.234
I can't go either. Sal.

1222
02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.875
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1223
02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.516
- He understands that.
- Excuse me. Sal.

1224
02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:58.197
Tom. can you get me off the hook?

1225
02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:02.279
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it. Sally.

1226
02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:47.674
You have to answer for Santino. Carlo.

1227
02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:57.157
- Mike. you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1228
02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:00.830
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1229
02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:05.875
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1230
02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:09.231
- Please. don't do this.
- Sit down.

1231
02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:14.033
Don't do this to me. please.

1232
02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:24.510
Barzini is dead.

1233
02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:28.190
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1234
02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:31.032
Moe Greene.

1235
02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:35.912
Strachi. Cuneo.

1236
02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:42.149
Today I settle all family business.
so don't tell me you're innocent. Carlo.

1237
02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:44.794
Admit what you did.

1238
02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:49.916
Get him a drink.

1239
02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:57.755
Come on.

1240
02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.875
Don't be afraid. Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1241
02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:07.158
I'm godfather to your son. Carlo.

1242
02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:16.073
Go ahead. drink. drink.

1243
02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:24.637
No. you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1244
02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:28.594
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1245
02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:30.279
Tom.

1246
02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:37.795
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1247
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.639
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1248
02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.110
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1249
02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:52.558
Who approached you?

1250
02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:55.320
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1251
02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.920
It was Barzini.

1252
02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:10.036
Good.

1253
02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:19.399
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1254
02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.309
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

1255
02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:30.234
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1256
02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:55.633
Hello. Carlo.

1257
02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.472
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama. please!

1258
02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:06.398
Michael!

1259
02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:09.637
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1260
02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.670
Michael. you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1261
02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:19.668
You waited until Papa died.
so nobody could stop you.

1262
02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:22.838
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1263
02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:28.797
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1264
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.638
Connie.

1265
02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.513
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

1266
02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:42.999
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1267
02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:47.113
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1268
02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:50.630
That's your husband.
that's your husband!

1269
02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:02.595
No! No. no...

1270
02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:06.315
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1271
02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.311
She's hysterical.

1272
02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:34.477
Hysterical.

1273
02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:38.760
Michael. is it true?

1274
02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:43.110
- Don't ask me about my business. Kay.
- Is it true?

1275
02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:46.869
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1276
02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:06.838
All right.

1277
02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:11.236
This one time.

1278
02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:18.759
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

1279
02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:26.479
Is it true?

1280
02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:30.952
Is it?

1281
02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:33.833
No.

1282
02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:50.111
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1283
02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:21.949
Don Corleone.
