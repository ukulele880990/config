00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.785
OK. come on. man. Why not?

182
00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.328
Can I just show you her Insta?

183
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.079
-Fine.
-Yes! OK. good.

184
00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.372
Jacki will be happy.

185
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.249
We both have to make
your wife happy now?

186
00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.459
Yeah. damn right we do.

187
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.086
If you want her to
make your gross food

188
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.963
and keep my house stocked
with ginger ale.

189
00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.461
-Stop it!
-Oh. Jesus Christ.

190
00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.257
Ruby. you're gonna kill her.

191
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.259
(Girls shouting in distance)

192
00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.344
(Baby fussing)

193
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.095
Tell your dad to leave me alone.

194
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.097
Um. excuse me?

195
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.183
Are you Shane Hollander?

196
00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.226
Yeah.

197
00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.519
Oh my God!

198
00:08:40.602 --> 00:08:42.270
Can we get a picture with you?

199
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.775
Um. I kind of have
my hands full at the moment.

200
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.445
Um. could you hold
his baby for him. please.

201
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.113
so we can get a picture?

202
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.951
"Hold his baby"?

203
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.160
I'm sorry. buddy!

204
00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:58.412
Hey. first of all.
it's my fucking baby.

205
00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.622
Four times.

206
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.624
-And second...
-Wait. do I have all the kids?

207
00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.625
(Girls laughing)

208
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.627
Oh. you're the worst one!

209
00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.212
You can't say
stuff like that to her.

210
00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.882
It's true. Second. they didn't
even fucking recognize me.

211
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.758
-Ding. ding. ding!
-We've hit five times.

212
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:12.469
That's when I'm
supposed to text Jacki.

213
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.137
-I'm telling on you. Daddy!
-Narc!

214
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.388
Narc. narc!

215
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.139
I'm getting a vasectomy.

216
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.766
Way too late.

217
00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:22.520
(Woman on TV): But this is
Shane Hollander's

218
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.146
fortress of solitude.

219
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.065
Here in Eastern Quebec

220
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:28.484
is the house he had built
on a private lake.

221
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.570
It's my favorite place on Earth.

222
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.405
My parents' cottage.
where I spent summers.

223
00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:33.406
is 10 minutes away.

224
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.699
I'm ready.

225
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:38.244
Unless you've decided
we should stay in and watch...

226
00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:39.954
whatever this is.

227
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.163
Sorry.

228
00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.250
It's so fucking boring
I almost fell into a coma.

229
00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:45.751
Mmm.

230
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.422
He's fucking hot. though.

231
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:50.881
(Chuckling)

232
00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.972
Are you seeing
anyone these days?

233
00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:00.891
Are you jealous?

234
00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.644
No. I think you know me
better than that.

235
00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:07.440
So there's no one serious?

236
00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:08.858
Nope.

237
00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.903
Not even Jane?

238
00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:16.365
What?

239
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:22.079
You've been texting for years.
I thought maybe it was serious.

240
00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.664
Or something.

241
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.251
It's not serious.

242
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.211
Or anything.

243
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.214
OK.

244
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.841
Sasha says hi.

245
00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.145
I'm. uh. heading out for a bit.

246
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.563
Cool.

247
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.440
Uh. to meet a friend.

248
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.691
Nice!

249
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.069
I'll be back later.

250
00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.654
I won't wait up.

251
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.739
It's not like that.

252
00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.491
It's just a... a friend.

253
00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.619
So Lily's just a buddy?

254
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.287
What?

255
00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.081
Chill. I know you text a Lily.

256
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.499
I don't.

257
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.250
OK. go get laid. weirdo.

258
00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:12.421
Or don't. I don't care.

259
00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:14.257
I hope you do.
You play better after.

260
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.091
Go fuck yourself.

261
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.259
-Oh. I plan to.
-Probably more than once.

262
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.386
Love a hotel room.

263
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.845
-Gross.
-Bye!

264
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.265
Oh!

265
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.809
Oh yeah!

266
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:34.110
(Doorbell ringing)

267
00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.945
(Knocking on door)

268
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.625
Do I take my shoes off?

269
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.252
No. you're good.

270
00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.217
Wow.

271
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.468
Wow!

272
00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:01.137
This place is great.

273
00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:05.266
Did you get this built.
or do you know who did?

274
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.060
Mr. Real Estate.

275
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.479
That's not what
I meant. I just...

276
00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.022
You think we need to talk?

277
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.482
No. after.

278
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.984
OK.

279
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.287
(Both moaning)

280
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.088
Oh!

281
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.892
(Birds chirping)

282
00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.864
I should go.

283
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.870
Or you could stay.

284
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.040
Stay?

285
00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:13.918
Here tonight.

286
00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.004
I'm not done with you.

287
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.424
And we have
afternoon game tomorrow.

288
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.926
so no morning practice.

289
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.261
I told Hayden.

290
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.055
Is Hayden your mother?

291
00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.389
No.

292
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.641
No. he's not?

293
00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:30.100
Fuck off.

294
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.354
Who cares what you told Hayden?

295
00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:42.238
Stay.

296
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.866
OK.

297
00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:48.577
OK?

298
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.163
OK.

299
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.307
Mmm.

300
00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:11.851
I'm hungry.

301
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.561
For what?

302
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.271
For food. pervert.

303
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.480
Hey.

304
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.621
You like tuna melt?

305
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:35.833
You want to make me a tuna melt?

306
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.252
-I was gonna make one for me.
-I can make two.

307
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:42.798
You head to Florida
after this. right?

308
00:14:42.923 --> 00:14:44.466
Yeah. right after the game.

309
00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:45.801
Tampa. then Sunrise.

310
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.761
then we go to Dallas
and St. Louis.

311
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.305
Ah. all the hot spots.

312
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.639
(Chuckling)

313
00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:53.809
Ginger ale cold enough?

314
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.686
Yeah. it's great.

315
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.062
Good.

316
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.982
Food will be ready soon.

317
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:02.526
(Announcer talking on TV)

318
00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.153
Jesus Christ!

319
00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.488
You know this guy. Ryan Price?

320
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.575
Yeah. from playing against him
and not wanting to fight him.

321
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.119
You did a season
with him. right?

322
00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:14.914
Mmm. He is not
what you would think.

323
00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.457
How so?

324
00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.710
Like. he's quiet.

325
00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:22.421
Doesn't talk.
Keeps to himself.

326
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.716
Not bad guy.
Doesn't make friends.

327
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:27.843
Well. he gets traded
every season.

328
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.511
Tough to make friends that way.

329
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.014
Probably he wants
to get traded again.

330
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.599
Buffalo is terrible.

331
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.644
Yeah. and their team sucks too.

332
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.604
(Chuckling)

333
00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:40.940
And people say you're not funny.

334
00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:43.067
They do?

335
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:44.944
Yeah. They say
you're boring. too.

336
00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:45.903
Who says that?

337
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.279
Me.

338
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.116
What's your. uh.
favorite city to play in?

339
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.118
-On the road?
-Mmm...

340
00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:56.789
I like New York.
'cause it's New York.

341
00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.582
They fucking hate me there.

342
00:15:58.707 --> 00:15:59.959
They hate you everywhere.

343
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.961
No. not Florida.

344
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.046
It's full of Boston people.

345
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.131
And you?

346
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.594
Uh. I like Ottawa.
'cause it's my hometown.

347
00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:11.845
Toronto. Winnipeg...

348
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.806
I'm happy they have
a team again.

349
00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:15.724
(Chuckling)

350
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.393
What. are those boring answers?

351
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.435
Yes.

352
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.647
Well. I like the hot places too.

353
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.065
Mmm.

354
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.566
Hot. like weather hot.

355
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.901
Ah. OK.

356
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:27.403
LA is hot.

357
00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:29.029
Hot women.

358
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.409
Yeah. sure. I mean.
there are hot women everywhere.

359
00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:39.331
There is a girl I like here
very much. Svetlana.

360
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.042
Oh?

361
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.337
She's old friend. from Russia.

362
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.590
Her father was famous goaltender
of Soviet team.

363
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.344
She knows everything
about hockey.

364
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:54.888
Cool.

365
00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:56.765
And she likes you very much.

366
00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.351
Oh.

367
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.687
That's nice.

So she's. like. your girlfriend?

370

No. no. Nothing like that.

371
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.070
She's old friend.

372
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.449
Sometimes we fuck. but...

373

she's busy these days. you know.
new business selling fancy cars.

374
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.789
Sounds perfect for you.

375
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.085
Yes. it's close to that. but...

376
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.172
But what?

But it's nothing more
than that for either of us.

379
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.682
But it's nice to have
regular woman like that around.

380
00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:41.894
You think she's the only woman
in Boston who'd sleep with you?

381
00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:43.270
Mmm.

382
00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:45.689

find someone else.

383

But you know me.

385

I don't know
that side of you at all.

387
00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.666
No. stay. stay.

388
00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:06.085
