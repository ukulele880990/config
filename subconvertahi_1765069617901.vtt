2
00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:32.801
<i>Where the fuck are you?
Dad is so fucking mad at you!</i>

3
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.699
You need a haircut.

4
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.077
Yes. sir.

5
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:47.126
The minister still wants to
meet you tonight. despite everything.

6
00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.294
It will be my honour.

7
00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.630
You should be honoured.

8
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.549
After yesterday.

9
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.301
You lose to...

10
00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.973
Latvia.

11
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.307
And yet. he drinks.

12
00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:05.101
How could you let that happen?

13
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.352
How are you not ashamed?

14
00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:07.687
I'm ashamed. Father.

15
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:08.938
Not nearly enough.

16
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:12.233
They teach you no discipline
in the American league.

17
00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:14.443
Your play is sloppy.

18
00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:19.782
The real shame is squandering the promise
you showed when you were young.

19
00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:22.619
I am a better player now
than I have ever been.

20
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:26.330
Our goalie is hurt.
The team didn't click.

21
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.415
Click?

22
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:31.085
What is this American nonsense?
What is clicking?

23
00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:33.964
You are the captain.
You make them click!

24
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.257
Always looking for someone else to blame.

25
00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.010
Since you were a boy.

26
00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.850
Who tied this for you?

27
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.561
Your mother?

28
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:50.189
She doesn't know how to do this properly.

29
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.235
No. Father.

30
00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:58.363
Mom is dead.

31
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:02.534
You remember?

32
00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:06.079
I meant your stepmother.

33
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.999
And where is Polina?

34
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.752
In Moscow?

35
00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.171
Of course.

36
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.259
We should go.

37
00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.137
To the gala.

38
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.683
So that I can meet the minister.

39
00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:31.354
Yes. Ready?

40
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.731
Let's go.

41
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:40.363
It always comes down to goaltending
and Vadilevich. well...

42
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.365
He was not sharp. but...

43
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:49.081
And Kitchov stays home
to rest for American prizes.

44
00:20:49.873 --> 00:20:52.500
Too good for his country now.

45
00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.168
Terrible. yes. terrible.

46
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:56.337
But there was no leadership.

47
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.423
That is always the problem. Leadership.

48
00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.092
Too much confidence?

49
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.760
Ilya?

50
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:04.596
Or too much pressure maybe?

51
00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:08.015
Too much talking. Mr. Minister. probably.

52
00:21:08.016 --> 00:21:13.980
But you love talking
about hockey. my angel.

53
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.191
Only when we're winning. Daddy.

54
00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:20.404
I'm taking Ilya with me to the bar.
He clearly needs another drink.

55
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.324
Always leading him around.

56
00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:26.200
Since they were children.

57
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.326
Thank you.

58
00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:30.706
I'm an angel. It would be great
if you could remember that.

59
00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:32.873
I want a drink.

60
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:35.335
But I have something more fun in mind.

61
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.937
Long time. Ilya.

62
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.401
Long time. Sasha.

63
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.116
I don't think you played that badly.

64
00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:10.870
I'd say thank you. but I know
you didn't watch a single fucking game.

65
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:13.998
For someone whose father has been
a hockey coach your whole life.

66
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.959
you sure have managed to avoid it.

67
00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.879
I pay attention sometimes.

68
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:22.840
When there's something
worth paying attention to.

69
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:25.594
Anyway. ultimately.
it doesn't matter for you.

70
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.219
It doesn't?

71
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.180
How do you figure that? My father...

72
00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.600
Your father is an asshole
who would have punished you either way.

73
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:36.395
You need to stop
giving a fuck what he thinks.

74
00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:41.692
And fuck these stupid games when
you have a real shot at the Cup this year.

75
00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:42.693
I do?

76
00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.944
Yes. you do.

77
00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:46.364
Hunter and the Admirals
won't get past New Jersey.

78
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:50.285
But New Jersey won't get
past Hollander and Montreal.

79
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:53.120
I think this year.
you can take Montreal.

80
00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:54.497
- This year?
- Yes.

81
00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:58.668
This year.
because I think Miitka is hurt.

82
00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.088
How do you know all this?

83
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:03.923
She's psychic.

84
00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:07.385
And with a hurt goalie.
you can only go so far.

85
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:10.722
As you and your team
proved rather well here.

86
00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:12.765
Touché.

87
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:18.312
And that's the East.
Then you can take anyone in the West.

88
00:23:18.313 --> 00:23:21.315
Chicago ain't what they used to be.

89
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:27.613
It'll probably end up being San Francisco.
They're good but they're too young.

90
00:23:27.614 --> 00:23:29.573
That's how you end up winning the Cup

91
00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:32.035
one year earlier
than I bet my father you would.

92
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:41.585
No thanks. Now it's bedtime for me.
I have to look perfect tomorrow.

93
00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.254
You always look perfect.

94
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:47.759
True. But you boys
also need to catch up.

95
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.220
See you in Boston. Ilya.

96
00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:52.514
Bye-bye.

97
00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:58.895
So?

98
00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:02.732
How's Paris. Sasha?

99
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:06.236
Oh. it's great. thanks.

100
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.990
I fucking love it there.

101
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:12.951
The clubs are insane.

102
00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:16.329
The girls are hot.

103
00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:19.499
And the boys.

104
00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:26.465
Well. you've seen French boys.
right. Ilya?

105
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:36.558
Oh my God. nothing?

106
00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.729
You don't do coke.

107
00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:43.607
you don't make jokes.

108
00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:46.485
you don't flirt back...

109
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:53.742
You used to be fun. Ilya.

110
00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:58.663
Remember?

111
00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:12.135
Here? Really?

112
00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:18.934
Danger used to get you going.
if memory serves.

113
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.064
We're not kids anymore. Sasha.

114
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:29.694
We're sure not.

115
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.783
Stop.

116
00:25:35.742 --> 00:25:38.662
OK. let's go somewhere.

117
00:25:40.455 --> 00:25:41.790
No.

118
00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:54.344
Fine. I'm gonna find a party.

119
00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:05.689
Bye. Ilya.

120
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.942
Nice to see you. Sasha.
