so I could go
and practice guitar.

518
00:29:57.087 --> 00:29:58.422
then I'd change it on the computer.

But he's not even in jazz band.

He just wanted
to hang out with Piper.

530

I was the one
hanging out with Piper.

531
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.066
So I'm supposed to go in

532
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.359
and change
his "absent" to "present."

533
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:20.819
so he can hang out with Piper?

534
00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:21.862
It's bullshit.

535
00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:23.947
So instead.
I gave him three more "absents."

00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:26.158
Good. Send a message.

537
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.327

00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:31.997
So I slashed
the tires on his bike.

540
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:38.378
I know. You're disappointed.

541
00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:39.838
I am disappointed.

- Look.

00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:45.218
You go in through a back door.
No fingerprints.

546
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.887
But more importantly.
the second this kid. Kevin.

547
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.473
knew what you were doing.
you got a loose end.

548
00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:50.974
Never trust anybody.

549
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:52.684
Anybody.

550
00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:55.145
And never let someone
get the upper hand on you.

551
00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.229
'Cause they'll use it.

552
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:00.650
Yeah.

All right.
I got to go practice.

00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.871
I have
this dumb winter pageant thing

557
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.081
tonight for jazz band.

558
00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:15.374
A pageant?

559
00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:16.375
Oof.

560
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.211
I know. I said it was dumb.

561
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.630
Good luck.

562
00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:25.634
We're gonna talk when I come in.

563
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.760
I know.

564
00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:29.930
I thought labor
wasn't progressing?

565
00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:31.473
Yeah. Then it did.

566
00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.392
Thanks for picking him up though.

567
00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:35.060
I don't know what's going on
with him these days.

568
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.269
He's acting out.

569
00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:38.647
Yeah. well. you know.
growing up is tough.

570
00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:40.565
Is that why
you're avoiding it?

571
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:42.943
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

572
00:31:43.026 --> 00:31:44.528
Yeah.

573
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:46.446
He'd really love to see you
more often. Jack.

574
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.489
I just picked him up.

575
00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.949
- I know.
- It was really nice.

576
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:50.617
We had a good talk.
He told me about school.

577
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.577
- I mean. I don't know what...
- He would love that to happen

578
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:53.829
more often is all I'm saying.

579
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:54.871
I got to go to work.

580
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:57.707

- Yeah.

Huh?

610
00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:56.344

First of all. sorry.

614
00:35:09.316 --> 00:35:12.068
Second.
could you be more specific?

615
00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:13.236
Honestly. you could be talking

616
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.738
about 12 different things
right now.

617
00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:16.239

what you're talking about.

I work for whoever pays me.

620
00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.788
You have about 40 seconds
to become helpful

621
00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:25.457
before you have
a terrible accident.

622
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.792
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

623
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.045
Who hired you to find him?

624
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:31.588
- Find who?
- You know who.

625
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:33.423
I promise you. I don't.

626
00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:34.591
If I did. I would tell you.

627
00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:36.926
I'm not a scrupulous person.
You can ask anybody.

628
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:41.181
The Intercontinental Seismic
Surveillance System.

629

Sound familiar?

630
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:45.852
Yeah.

631
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.187
I did that.

632
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.313
It was a weird job.

633
00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:49.564
Somebody was trying
to find someone

634
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:52.359
who was running tests on some
weapons systems in the Arctic.

635
00:35:52.442 --> 00:35:54.986
And I... I found the location.

636
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.112
And I walked.

637
00:35:56.196 --> 00:35:58.156
- For who?
- [laughs] I don't know.

638
00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.783
I'm telling you.
all the communication

639
00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:01.326
is encrypted and untraceable.

640
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.119
That's how it's supposed to be.

641
00:36:03.203 --> 00:36:04.496
So if someone
like you shows up.

642
00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:06.039
I don't have any answers.

643
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.667
Look. I don't ask questions.

644
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.960
I just find people
that no one else can find.

00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:12.462
It's what I do.

646
00:36:17.384 --> 00:36:19.344
You really don't know what you did.

647
00:36:20.053 --> 00:36:21.137
[laughs] I guess not.

648
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.641
I mean. I can tell you're
very upset about it though.

Did you say
the "mythological world"?

666
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.624
- Yes.
- Right.

667
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:33.960
So. uh...

668
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:38.006

671
00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:41.593
Okay.

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.137
So. things that don't actually exist.

673
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.055

are responsible for 'em.

Hey. What did that taser thing
do to my head?

688
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:28.097
It's not a taser.
it's an Acquiescer.

689

Just take a deep breath
and have a seat. Jack.

The data you retrieved
from the I-triple-S

was used
to pinpoint the location.

696

and classified

Turns out Jack here didn't know
what he was doing.

708
00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:52.724
Somebody hired him to find the complex

709
00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:53.892
and. incredibly. he did.

710
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:56.060
- Who?
- He doesn't know.

711
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:57.020
I don't know.

712
00:39:57.103 --> 00:39:58.938
- Yes. he does.
- No. he doesn't.

713
00:39:59.022 --> 00:40:00.565
They always know something.

714
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.443
Sometimes you just got
to shake it out of them.

715
00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:07.405
I'm not gonna like you.
I can tell right away.

716
00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:09.532

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:17.957
What the hell?

721
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.419
- Yeah. Chief?
- This guy's not cooperating.

722
00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:23.671
Ah. Should we do the thing?

723
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:24.797
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

724
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:26.049
Cal. let's talk about this for a minute.

725
00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:27.091
There's nothing to talk about.

726
00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.843
You can't trust this guy.
He's on The List.

727
00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.261
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

728
00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.429
Look. I'm not on any watch list.

729
00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:33.056
I know for a fact that--

730
00:40:34.724 --> 00:40:36.434
Wait a minute.

731
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:38.186
- You don't mean--
- Yes. That list.

732
00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.730
You're on it. I checked. NL-four.

733
00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:42.148
Are you telling me this clown

734
00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:44.484
is a level-four Naughty Lister?

735
00:40:44.567 --> 00:40:47.028
"A level-four Naughty Lister"?

736
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.112
- Oh. Is that funny to you?
- Hey.

737
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:49.030
- [roars]
- Hey. hey. hey!

738
00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.949
What are we doing here? Come on.

739
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:53.242
I know this is killing you.
But you have to trust me.

740
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:55.244
Dismembering this shit bag
isn't gonna help.

741
00:40:55.328 --> 00:40:57.372
It would feel good. but it won't help.

742
00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:58.581
I'm right here.

743
00:40:58.665 --> 00:40:59.666
[both] Shut up.

744
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:04.045
- What are you thinkin'?
- We're gonna put him to work.

745
00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:04.963
No.

746
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:06.631
- Absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

747
00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:08.633
You said you work for whoever pays you.

748
00:41:09.342 --> 00:41:10.343
Today. that's me.

749
00:41:10.426 --> 00:41:12.303
He's not telling us everything he knows.
Look at him.

750
00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:13.596
He is telling us everything he knows.

751
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.973
he just doesn't know who hired him.

752
00:41:15.056 --> 00:41:15.890
Well. I mean.

753
00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:19.227
- how much are we talking here?
- Garcia?

754
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.145
- [roaring]
- I'm... [groaning]

755
00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:24.107
Okay. I don't know who it was.

756
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.317
but I could figure out where they are.

757
00:41:26.401 --> 00:41:27.402
Or where they were last night!

758
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:28.319
[groans]

759
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.322
God! [sighs]

760
00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:33.950
[panting]

761
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:36.619
Look. it is anonymous.
I don't know who it is.

762
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:40.665
But in my line of work.
I need insurance.

763
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:42.417
You know. in case of billing issues.

764
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.543
So. I Trojan horsed

765
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:45.628
a digital tracking bug into their VPN.

766
00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:47.463
- Are you saying--
- Yeah. I can track the device.

767
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:48.881
Then I suggest you do it.

768
00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:50.633
Can we circle back
on the whole paying me thing?

769
00:41:50.717 --> 00:41:52.635
I know what they paid you.
We'll double it.

770
00:41:53.386 --> 00:41:54.762
- Triple.
- Garcia?

771
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.431
- [roars]
- Hey. hey. hey! Come on.

772
00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.725
All right. all right. Double's fine.

773
00:41:58.808 --> 00:41:59.767
It's Christmas.

774
00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:00.935
Wise choice.

775
00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:02.603
I need my cell phone.

776
00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:06.107
[groans]

777
00:42:09.819 --> 00:42:11.195
Whoever did this...

778
00:42:12.405 --> 00:42:13.781
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

779
00:42:14.407 --> 00:42:15.908
- I work alone.
- You used to.

780
00:42:15.992 --> 00:42:18.119
No offense.
but I'm not rolling into Aruba

781
00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.829
undercover with a giant elf.

782
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:21.831
It's E-L-F.

783
00:42:21.914 --> 00:42:23.875
- [Zoe] Cal!
- We can't trust this guy.

784
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:25.877
That's why you're holding the leash.

785
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.128
- And this...
- [clicks]

786
00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:28.629
- [whirs]
- [beeps]

787
00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:31.132
...is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

788
00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.925
You're mine until we find him.

789
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:34.719
I suggest you get going.

790
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.974
- Oh! God. claws!
- [roars]

791
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:45.271

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.414
[sighs]

793
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:06.709
Well. this is unfortunate.

794
00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:10.171
No. This is what needed to be done.

795
00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.548
I sincerely doubt that.

796
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.635
You know. I know a guy

797
00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:18.137
who's gonna be very upset about this.

798
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:25.686
What are you going to do with that?

799
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.649
The world is a mess.
Because they fear nothing.

800
00:43:31.526 --> 00:43:34.112
I'm going to give them
something to fear.

801
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.491
I'm going to do in one night

802
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:42.495
what you have failed to do
for centuries.

803
00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:44.580
And what is that?

804
00:43:45.123 --> 00:43:46.999
I'm gonna make the world a better place.

805
00:43:57.593 --> 00:44:00.096
- What're you doing?
- Borrowing some of your energy.

806
00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:05.101
Now.

807
00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:08.437
go to sleep. Nicholas.

808
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:11.399
Go to sleep.

809
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.410
- [tires screeching]
- [horn blaring]

810
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.167

[squeaks]

813
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:44.390
We doing some last-minute
Christmas shopping?

814
00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:45.474
Gearing up.

815
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.643
Grab a car. Something practical.

816
00:44:47.727 --> 00:44:50.813
["Deck The Halls" by
The Bird and the Bee playing]

817
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:02.450
- Here.
- [sighs]

818
00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:04.202
[Callum sighs]

819
00:45:11.584 --> 00:45:12.543
Let's go.

820
00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:26.974
Ooh! [panting]

821
00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:29.518

[lively chatter]

823
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.493
What the hell just happened?

824
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:47.036
Toy stores.

825
00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:50.498
Toy stores what?

826
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.500
The supply closets are portal stations

827
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.961
for the North Pole
Field Network Transit System.

828
00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:57.588
[sighs]

829
00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:04.804
Car.

830
00:46:08.683 --> 00:46:09.850
I said. "Practical."

831
00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:11.352
Like what. a minivan?

832
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.895
Who wants a practical Hot Wheels?

833
00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:14.272
Also. what difference does it make?

834
00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:15.273
I gave you a directive.

835
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:17.775
A directive?

836
00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.735
[scoffing]

837
00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:21.696
Is that what you think
is going on here?

838
00:46:22.238 --> 00:46:24.240
I'm telling you now.
you better listen to me

839
00:46:24.323 --> 00:46:26.033
because things are about to get real.

840
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:37.837
[beaming]

841
00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:43.301
- How did--
- I adjusted its reality.

842
00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.802
- And does that--
- No. it doesn't work

843
00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:46.220
on everything. No. you can't try it.

844
00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:48.180
No. you can't drive.
No more questions.

845
00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:50.558
Now. get in.
And be careful with those robots.

846
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.230
- [tires screeching]
- [intense music playing]

847
00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:01.652
[music stops]

848
00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:12.621
So. you're. like.
the bodyguard for Santa Claus?

849
00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:15.333
I'm the commander of the E.L.F.

850
00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:16.417
What's that stand for?

851
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.669
Enforcement.
Logistics and Fortification.

852
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.463
But as far as you're concerned.

853
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:23.257
it stands for
Extremely Large and Formidable.

854
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.051
[scoffs]

855
00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:26.427
Uh-huh.

856
00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:30.014
And that's all you do all year...

857
00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:32.516
just protect Santa?

858
00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:34.518
It's a big job.

859
00:47:34.602 --> 00:47:36.103
Sure. sure.

860
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.066
It's one day though. right?

861
00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:43.027
Like. it's a big job for one day?

862
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.862
We work 364 days a year

863
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:48.449
because on that one day.
we deliver presents

864
00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:51.077
to several billion
individual domiciles

865
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.204
across 37 time zones.

866
00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:56.165
Without ever being detected
by a single human being.

867
00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:57.750
We prep. we rehearse.

868
00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:00.544
every moment. every stop.
down to the last chimney.

869
00:48:00.628 --> 00:48:02.880
So. yeah. it's a lot of work.

870
00:48:03.756 --> 00:48:05.174
364 days?

871
00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:06.300
We have Boxing Day off.

872
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:11.472
Wouldn't it be easier
if you broke it up?

873
00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.099
You know. like.
send different teams out.

874
00:48:13.182 --> 00:48:15.059
different places.
just more efficient?

875
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:16.352
No. it doesn't work like that.

876
00:48:16.435 --> 00:48:17.770
He's got to do it all himself?

877
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:20.231
He doesn't have to. It's his purpose.

878
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:21.941
He's a singular force in the universe.

879
00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:23.567
Okay. so. worst-case scenario.

880
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:25.236
is there someone
that can step in for him?

881
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:28.406
- Like a Vice Santa--
- Are you listening to me? No.

882
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:30.199
No one can do what he does.

883
00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:33.035
He knows when you're sleeping.
he knows when you're awake.

884
00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:35.329
And he knows that
about every single person

885
00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:36.622
on this planet.

886
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.332
He has a list the size of Rhode Island.

887
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:40.209
and he checks it twice.

888
00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:41.961
If you were to try to read
that list just once.

889
00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:43.045
it would take you a decade.

890
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.505
But he does it twice.

891
00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.882
And the reason why
he's able to do any of it

892
00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:50.219
is because he is Santa Claus.

893
00:48:50.302 --> 00:48:51.804
The one and only.

894
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.682
And no one else
can execute his mission.

895
00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:58.727
- Which is?
- To spread cheer. asshole.

896

Oh. I'm fun.

you give it a shot.

See. look at this guy.
He's married. but not to her.

where his wedding ring should be.

935

Because it's pretty easy.

1253
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.750
The concert starts at seven.

1254
01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:26.960
Well. I'm not gonna to be home
by seven.

1255
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.878
- Just tell Dylan that I...
- <i>I'm not telling him anything.</i>

1256
01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.130
If you want to tell him
something. do it yourself.

1257
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.382
[sighs in exasperation]

1258
01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.302
What?

1259
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.304
I didn't say anything.

1260
01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.190
[beaming]

1261
01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.409
Dylan. right?

1262
01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:04.539
Yeah.

1263
01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.584
He's a good kid.

1264
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.127
Yeah. I know he's a good kid.

1265
01:08:19.012 --> 01:08:20.013
It's not what you think.

1266
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.348
His mother and I were never together.

1267
01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.642
I mean. I'm his father.
but I've never been his dad.

1268
01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:27.937
She's a doctor now.

1269
01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:29.522
And she's married
to a really good guy.

1270
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.898
and he is a good dad.

1271
01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:32.942
So. the last thing
the kid needs is like.

1272
01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:36.529
you know. some "spare dad"
who's a degenerate gambler.

1273
01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:37.989
hanging out with the scum of the earth

1274
01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.532
whose got nothing to offer him. so...

1275
01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.660
Honestly. the best thing
I can do for the kid

1276
01:08:42.744 --> 01:08:43.745
is keep some distance.

1277
01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:44.912
so I don't get in the way

1278
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.248
and he's not disappointed all the time.

1279
01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:48.833
Uh-huh.

1280
01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:51.419
"Uh-huh" what?

1281
01:08:52.003 --> 01:08:54.422
I'm just saying. if you're trying
not to disappoint him...

1282
01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.635
doesn't sound like it's working.

1283
01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:11.105
[mysterious music playing]

1284
01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.997
[Jack] Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this...

1285
01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.542
but what's the deal
with Santa and his brother?

1286
01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.508
They used to work together.

1287
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.052
Back in the beginning.

1288
01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:44.097
Red gave gifts to well behaved children.

1289
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.765
and The Brother helped
keep track of who they were.

1290
01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.102
Then The Brother started making lists.

1291
01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:52.480
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1292
01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.023
He didn't like the idea

1293
01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.109
of a running list
of misbehaved children.

1294
01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.195
But The Brother became obsessed.

1295
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.323
So you're saying.

1296
01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.909
Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1297
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.494
Yes.

1298
01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.580
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1299
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.166
Red was furious.

1300
01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.293
So he took The List away.

1301
01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:16.963
Then The Brother never forgave him.

1302
01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.215
He went out on his own.

1303
01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.426
Eventually hooking up with The Witch.

1304
01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.886
who was also in the punishment game.

1305
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.764
Working Iceland
and several other Nordic territories.

1306
01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:31.519
They were together for years.
but it ended badly.

1307
01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.398
Santa's brother have a name

1308
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.191
or is it just "Santa's Brother"?

1309
01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.028
His name is Krampus.

1310
01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:42.947
[eerie music playing]

1311
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.202
All right. listen to me. I don't know

1312
01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:49.328
what's waiting for us in here.

1313
01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.873
but The Brother and The Witch.
they're extremely dangerous.

1314
01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.541
And not in the ways
that you're used to.

1315
01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.293
If you see them. do not engage.

1316
01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.170
So don't pick a fight with The Witch.

1317
01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.129
Got it.

1318
01:10:58.212 --> 01:10:59.380
[Callum] If Nick is here.

1319
01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:00.673
he's probably being held
in the dungeon.

1320
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.425
There's a door around back
that the guards use.

1321
01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:04.385
We're gonna have to quietly
sneak through the courtyard.

1322
01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:06.220
past the guillotines.
break in. and head down.

1323
01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:07.305
[Jack] Wait. guillotines?

1324
01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:10.308
Also. do not touch anything.
Under any circumstances.

1325
01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:13.186
There is much in here
that is not of the natural world.

1326
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.979
You're human. therefore weak.

1327
01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.815
So. if you need to touch anything.
get me to do it.

1328
01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:20.777
Wait a minute.

1329
01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.278
Are you not human?

1330
01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:23.738
Do I look human?

[Jack] Hey. so listen. man.

1336
01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.576
I think if you don't need me here.

1337
01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.411
I might just go back to the car.

1338

[hellhound roars]

1343
01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:30.972

[in normal voice] What'd you do?

1353

What do you mean. "what did I do?"

1354
01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:28.988
I didn't do anything!

- We are not thieves.
- [Jack] Yeah. we're not thieves!

We're not thieves!

- Ooh!
- [creature grunts]

1364
01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.595
This was in his pocket.

1365
01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:53.930
All right. I can explain that.

1366
01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:55.097
I can explain that.

1367
01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.357
I told you not to touch anything.

1368
01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:05.775
It was an innocent mistake.

1369
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.526
You tried to steal
a priceless piece of gold

1370
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.570
from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1371
01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:12.156
Not "innocent." and not a "mistake."

1372
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.824
Well. who leaves their gold
just lying out

1373
01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:15.117
in an open treasure chest?

1374
01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.994
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1375
01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.788
Guests come. they leave him gifts.

1376
01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.247
You stole from it.

1377
01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:23.250
I shouldn't be surprised.

1378
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.545
Is that 'cause
I happen to be on "The List"?

1379
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.215
You disappointed in me too. Cal?

1380
01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.634
I have no expectations of you. Jack.

1381
01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.344
so I can't be disappointed.

1382
01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.311
You know.
I got problems of my own.

1383
01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:45.106
I owe somebody a lot of money
that I don't have.

1384
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:47.483
I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

1385
01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:49.735
If you look at it a certain way.

1386
01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:50.945
what choice did I even have?

1387
01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.071
You have every choice.

1388
01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:54.073
It's all choices.

1389
01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.242
You don't just "happen to be"
on The List. Jack.

1390
01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.035
you put yourself there.

1391
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:00.871
You decide to steal gold.

1392
01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:03.249
You decide
to only look out for yourself.

1393
01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.042
over everyone else on this Earth.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.129

who are counting on us.

Counting on me. to do my job.

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.224
Nick always says.

1397
01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:22.643
that every decision.

1398
01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:25.271
big or small. is an opportunity.

1399
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.024
To be "nice"?

1400
01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:29.150
To be good.

1401
01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.652
Or not.

1402
01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:37.616
I was one day away from retirement.

1403
01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:39.410
And this happens.

1405
01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.251

1407
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:52.548
Why?

1408
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.052
I couldn't see it anymore.

1409
01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.387
Couldn't see what?

1410
01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:03.893

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:08.874
It's Lord Krampus!

1430
01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.292
[crowd cheering]

1431
01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:16.757
[crowd quiets]

1432
01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.468
Callum Drift.

1433
01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:21.637
Lord Krampus.

1434
01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:25.724
The festivities were just beginning.

1435
01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.060
But I don't remember inviting you.

1436
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:36.819
You shouldn't be here.

1437
01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.321
You know you shouldn't be here.

1438
01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:42.032
And yet here you are.

1439
01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.826
And with a mortal.

1440
01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:46.871
Uh. I'm Jack O'Malley.

1441
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.330
I didn't... I'm not...

1442
01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.166
We didn't even...
I mean. obviously we...

1443
01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:52.668
I just met him today.

1444
01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.837
The big one was armed with this.

1445
01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:57.798
A Northern Vambrace.

1446
01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:59.258
Thank you.

1447
01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.803
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

1448
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.432
- Krampus. I can explain--
- You're trying to find him.

1449
01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.768
And you thought he would be here.

1450
01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.272
Well. guess what. Northerner?

1451
01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:18.402
He's not here. [laughs]

1452
01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.987
[crowd laughs]

1453
01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:22.698
Last night he was taken
from The Compound.

1454
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:24.158
by The Witch.

1455
01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.911
And I know that she was here
not long ago.

1456
01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:31.373
Are you accusing me of something. Drift?

1457
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.460
You and she were partners once.

1458
01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.754
Roaming the countryside. the villages.

1459
01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:38.881
Punishing people.

1460
01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.466
Yes.

1461
01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.636
But back then she was glorious.

1462
01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.889
An Ogre 18 feet high.

1463
01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.058
the skin of an elephant.

1464
01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.353
giant pair of tails.

1465
01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:58.067
And. yes. punishing
as the cruelest winter.

1466
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.695
We had some wonderful times together.

1467
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:05.449
But I gave up that work. remember?

1468
01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:10.579
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty.

1469
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:13.791
trying to scare them into decency.

1470
01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.125
I did my part!

1471
01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:18.963
The only punishing I do now...

1472
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.383
is for fun.

1473
01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.010
Like my good friend over here.

1474
01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.345
[creature sighs]

1475
01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:30.182
Enjoying his headache on <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1476
01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.017
But today is not <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1477
01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.395
In this house. Northerner.

1478
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:38.565
it is always <i>Krampusnacht.</i>

1479
01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:41.360
[crowd chanting]

1480
01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:52.955
Krampus!

1481
01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:56.292
Why was she here?

1482
01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:59.295
- [drink splashes]
- [glass shatters]

1483
01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.839
Many years ago. she gave me a gift.

1484
01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:04.967
She came because she wanted it back.

1485
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:05.968
A gift?

1486
01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.261
What gift?

1487
01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:09.555
The <i>Glaskäfig.</i>

1488
01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:13.309
On its face.
a simple glass snow globe.

1489
01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.478
But its true purpose is nefarious.

1490
01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:18.814
tremendously punishing.

1491
01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.859
She wants to punish them all.

1492
01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:25.654
The <i>Glaskäfig</i> is solitude.

1493
01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.906
A prison for but one.

1494
01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:30.617
Krampus. I need to find him.

1495
01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:37.583
Let me go.

1496
01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.961
And why...

1497
01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:43.339
would I do that?

1498
01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:48.218
Because we need him.

1499
01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.056
Now more than ever. we need him.

1500
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.892
And you know that.

1501
01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:58.771
Let me go.

1502
01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:09.823
Northerner...

1503
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.369
you are not going anywhere.

1504
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:17.414
You. Get out.

1505
01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:20.084
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1506
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.337
There is a price for this intrusion.

1507
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.673
Now and forever.

1508
01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.093
Drift belongs to me.

1509
01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.638
[crowd laughs]

1510
01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:34.932
So I can...

1511
01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.392
just walk out of here?

1512
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.727
I suggest you run.

1513
01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:44.858
You'll learn to love it here.

1514
01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:47.611
Take him away.

1515
01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:49.822
[eerie music playing]

1516
01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:52.408
Wait! Uh... Wait. wait. wait!

1517
01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:53.325
Sorry. wait. Um...

1518
01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:54.952
Lord...

1519
01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:56.120
Mister-Lord Krampus...

1520
01:21:58.247 --> 01:21:59.456
you and I aren't so different.

1521
01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.833
[slurps]

1522
01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.712
We're pretty different. but I think

1523
01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:06.922
we have some things in common.

1524
01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:09.341
Ah. Do you now?

1525
01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.676
Yeah.

1526
01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:11.844
I mean. you strike me as a guy

1527
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.595
that likes to have a good time.

1528
01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:14.805
Bit of a gambler.

1529
01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:16.306
Well. so am I.

1530
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:18.725
Now. when we came in here.
my man told me

1531
01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.979
that he thought he could
beat you at your game

1532
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.648
- Krampalslop.
- What?

1533
01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:25.774
- [scoffs]
- [crowd laughs]

1534
01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.861
Now. initially I said "no way."

1535
01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.571
But the more I see him getting riled up.

1536
01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:31.780
I'm starting to like my odds.

1537
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:33.740
So. just hear me out.

1538
01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.578
If you win.
we go to your dungeon forever.

1539
01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:40.664
If he wins. we walk.

1540
01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:43.876
Unless you don't want to.
for some reason.

1541
01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:45.544
I mean. I get that. he's a big guy.

1542
01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:49.006
There's no shame.
Lot of people watching.

1543
01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:55.429
Imbeciles!

1544
01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:57.764

1549
01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:14.698
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1550
01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:26.210
The rules are as follows.

1551
01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:29.713
The contestants will
exchange blows. in turn.

1552
01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:33.342
The first to be knocked out
or die. loses.

1553
01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:40.557
First Touch.

1554
01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:42.267

[sighing]

1556
01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.489
You know. I really wish

1557
01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:56.532
there was another way
that we could do this.

1558
01:23:56.615 --> 01:23:58.575
- [crowd groans]
- [creature] Come on.

1559
01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.452
I'm sure you do.

1560
01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:02.913
He's still your brother.

1561
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:05.666
And he never gave up on you.

1562
01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.085
What would you know about it?

1563
01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.419
I know him.

1564
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:15.676

- My turn.
- [crowd cheering]

1569
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:44.663
I could be merciful.

1570
01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.374
and kill him on the First Touch.

1571
01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:50.586
But what fun would that be?
[chuckles]

He just slapped the shit out of me.

Yeah. that was so embarrassing.

1580

1610
01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:25.323
[Jack panting]

1611
01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:32.456
[laughs]

1612
01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:34.541
I thought I had some shady friends.

1613
01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.042
[both laughing]

1614
01:27:37.544 --> 01:27:38.712
I can't believe that worked.

1615
01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:41.089
Yeah. sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

1616
01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.674
No. it was great.

1617
01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:43.800
Well.

1618
01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.095
I misjudged you.

1619
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:48.180
Ha!

1620
01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:50.182
Not what you'd expect

1621
01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.017
from a "Class Four
Naughty Lister." right?

1622
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.310
Well. it's Level Four.

1623
01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:55.020
But that's what I'm saying.

1624
01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:57.272
you could've left. But you didn't.

1625
01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:00.442
Thank you.

1626
01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:04.321
All right.

1627
01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.947
Should we go find your guy?

1628
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.658
Let's save Christmas.

1629
01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:11.870
Right.

1630
01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:13.538
Say it.

1631
01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:14.915
- I can't.
- [Callum] Yes. you can.

1632
01:28:14.998 --> 01:28:16.249
- Say it.
- I don't want to.

1633
01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.168
- Let's save Christmas.
- I'm not gonna say that.

1634
01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:22.005
I'm gonna need you to say.
"Let's save Christmas."

1635
01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.090
All right. God! Okay.

1636
01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:25.801
Let's save Christmas.

1637
01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:28.178
That was terrible.

1638
01:28:28.261 --> 01:28:30.639
[sighs] Okay. All right. all right.

1639
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.391
[exhales]

1640
01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:35.393
Let's save Christmas.

1641
01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:37.187
There it is.

1642
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:38.647
All right.

1643
01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.148
All right. so the snow globe.

1644
01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:41.608
What's the deal with that?
The glossy pig?

1645
01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:44.277
<i>Glaskäfig.</i> It's German for "Glass Cage."

1646
01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:46.446
Well. what do you think Gryla's
trying to do? Is there only--

1647
01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:47.531
[shushes]

1648
01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:49.241
[Jack echoing]
<i>Gryla's trying to do?</i>

1649
01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.328
We gotta go. Come on.

1650
01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:56.289
[man] Mom.

1651
01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:58.375
Ready for another test.

1652
01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:01.336
Good.

1653
01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:02.671
The next name on The List?

1654
01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:04.965
No.

1655
01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:07.759
I have a better idea.

1656
01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.889
She said
she wanted to punish them all.

1657
01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:14.933
It seems like the <i>Glaskäfig</i>
was just for one person.

1658
01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:17.102
Is it possible she could make
more of 'em with like.

1659
01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:19.396
"witch magic" or...

1660
01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:21.314
She would need billions of them.

1661
01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:22.399
She's immensely powerful.

1662
01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:23.817
but that's a big lift for a Conjurer.

1663
01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:25.986
Okay.

1664
01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:27.529
I mean. honestly.
the only place that has

1665
01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:28.864
that kind of manufacturing capacity...

1666
01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:29.865
Look out!

1667
01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:36.621
[piano playing Tchaikovsky's
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

1668
01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:57.142
This something
that happens to you a lot?

1670
01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:00.937

1671
01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:03.148
No.

1672
01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:04.232
This is rare.

1673
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.365
[Callum] It's for you.

1674
01:30:12.782 --> 01:30:14.826
[Jack] Well.
I'm not touching that thing.

1675
01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:16.036
Just get back in the truck.

1676
01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:17.412
we'll drive right around
the haunted piano.

1677
01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:18.496
We have to open it.

1678
01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:22.792
This... This is how it starts.

1679
01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:24.836
You're doing it though.

1680
01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:37.349
- [piano music stops]
- Oh. see?

1681
01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:39.976
[phone vibrating]

1682
01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.061
[Jack sighs]

1683
01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:43.438
Dylan.

1684
01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:45.565
<i>Did you send me
this stupid present</i>

1685
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:46.691
<i>instead of coming to this thing?</i>

1686
01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:48.401
Wait. what?

1687
01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.445
Because if you don't want to come.
I don't care.

1688
01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:52.781
I wanted to be there.
I really did. then something--

1689
01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.658
[Dylan] <i>Just stop. okay?</i>

1690
01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:56.326
<i>You don't have to pretend</i>

1691
01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:57.911
<i>because my mom
is guilt-tripping you.</i>

1692
01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.329
I'm not pretending.

1693
01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:00.455
<i>I really want to find a way to--</i>

1694
01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:01.623
You never come to anything.

1695
01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:02.958
Yeah. I...

1696
01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:04.751
- I know. I know.
- [Dylan] <i>Whatever.</i>

1697
01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:05.835
<i>I got to go.</i>

1698
01:31:05.919 --> 01:31:08.129
<i>Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts. okay?</i>

1699
01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:10.632
Wait. wait. Dylan.
what'd you mean by that?

1700
01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:12.175
<i>This thing.</i>

1701
01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:14.594
- Dylan. don't touch that!
- No!

1702
01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:15.762
- Don't!
- [Jack] Wait!

1703
01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:17.639
Do you seriously think
that there's any kid on Earth.

1704
01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:18.848
- <i>who really wishes...</i>
- Dylan. listen to me!

1705
01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:19.808
- Put that down!
- <i>...he had a snow globe?</i>

1706

<i>Because I'm here
to tell you that...</i>

[growling]

1709
01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.110
- What's happening?
- Put that down.

Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

1712
01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.366
I don't know!

1713
01:31:40.787 --> 01:31:41.830
Jack!

1714
01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:46.251
It's my kid.

1715
01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:49.212
Find me.

1716
01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:51.297
[whooshes]

1717
01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:04.477
[Dylan] Dad? Dad!

1718
01:32:04.561 --> 01:32:05.603
- Dylan!
- [Dylan] What's going on?

1719
01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:06.896
Where are we?

1720
01:32:10.108 --> 01:32:11.151
Oh. my God.

1721
01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:12.569
[heavy footsteps approaching]

1722
01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:13.862
Oh. my God.

1723
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:18.575
It worked.

1724
01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:20.118
[whimpers]

1725
01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:25.498
Jack O'Malley.

1726
01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:27.834
Level four.

1727
01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:31.129
What a perfect way
to start my collection.

1728
01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:33.965
Bring production online!

1729
01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:40.263
- [machine whirring]
- [electrical crackling]

1730
01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:54.360
Tonight.

1731
01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:56.237
I will deliver one of these

1732
01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:58.990
to every single deviant on The List.

1733
01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:02.077
And when they wake up
and open their gift?

1734
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.120
They'll join my collection.

1735
01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:07.582
And the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

1736
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.417
Finally.

1737
01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:11.419
Tonight.

1738
01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:13.671
I make The Ride.

1739
01:33:16.883 --> 01:33:18.051
Director. we have Drift.

1740
01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:19.385
What happened?

1741
01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:21.012
What do you know about the <i>Glaskäfig?</i>

1742
01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:23.473
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison The Naughty.

1743
01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:24.891
Krampus has it. Why?

1744
01:33:24.974 --> 01:33:26.893
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

1745
01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:28.603
<i>And I think she's trying
to punish everyone on The List.</i>

1746
01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:29.562
Wait. slow down.

1747
01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:30.980
O'Malley just got globed.

1748
01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:32.148
<i>and disappeared.</i>

1749
01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:34.067
- What?
- His kid too.

1750
01:33:34.567 --> 01:33:35.860
Oh. dear Lord.

1751
01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:38.029
- [Zoe] Run O'Malley's tag.
- [female tech] Yes. Director.

1752
01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:42.826
Zoe. I think she's trying
to mass produce the <i>Glaskäfig.</i>

1753
01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:44.619
<i>How could she possibly do that?</i>

1754
01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:45.703
<i>Think about it.
What's the one place</i>

1755
01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:47.330
<i>that's capable of something like that?</i>

1756
01:33:47.413 --> 01:33:49.541
The North Pole.
But Nick's not there.

1757
01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.252
The complex runs on his power.
That can't be it.

1758
01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:55.213
- Unless...
- <i>Unless he never left.</i>

1759
01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.549
But the snow cat. the jet...

1760
01:33:57.632 --> 01:33:59.259
<i>Drones. Diversions.</i>

1761
01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:02.512
Nick is still there.

1762
01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.639
Director.
I am not picking up a signal

1763
01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:05.765
for O'Malley's tracker.

1764
01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:10.270
Because he's under the dome.

1765
01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:12.522
<i>But I've been talking
to your team all night.</i>

1766
01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:14.149
You have?

1767
01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:19.571
Try Partridge.

1768
01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:20.822
Connect to Partridge.

1769
01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:22.198
Yes. Director.

1770

- Hey.</i>

1771
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:26.661
<i>How you holding up. MC?</i>

1772
01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:28.163
I can't sleep.

1773
01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:30.832
I'm just keeping myself busy
baking cookies for him.

1774
01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:33.126
For when he comes home.

1775
01:34:33.543 --> 01:34:35.962
Well. he's gonna love that.
What do you got baking?

1776
01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:39.966
Just pulled out
a fresh batch of macaroons.

1777
01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:44.012
He'll love that.

1778
01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:47.265
Hang in. And I'll keep you posted.

1779
01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:49.559
<i>Thanks.</i>

1780
01:34:51.144 --> 01:34:52.061
That's not her.

1781
01:34:52.145 --> 01:34:53.354
What do you mean?

1782
01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:54.689
<i>Nick hates macaroons.</i>

1783
01:34:56.816 --> 01:34:58.151
They're shapeshifters.

1784
01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:00.987
The Witch. the Lads.
They're all shapeshifters.

1785
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.324
The North Pole has been taken.

1786
01:35:12.165 --> 01:35:13.791
They're onto us.

1787
01:35:14.334 --> 01:35:15.418
[Dylan] Where are we?

1788
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:16.502
- What's happening?
- Okay. okay. okay.

1789
01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:17.587
Now. listen.

1790
01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:19.339
[sighs]

1791
01:35:19.422 --> 01:35:21.216
Now. I know
what this is going to sound like.

1792
01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:23.801
[sighs] Basically...

1793
01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.681
Santa is missing.

1794
01:35:29.515 --> 01:35:32.185
and that giant lady is a witch.

1795
01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:33.645
And she got the snow globes

1796
01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:36.648
from a giant demonic Christmas

1797
01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:38.483
goat-man.

1798
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.902
And now. they're gonna make
millions of 'em.

1799
01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:43.905
with that magical photocopier thing.

1800
01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:46.074
Look. I don't have
all the technical details.

1801
01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:48.785
but basically these globes
are meant to imprison

1802
01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:50.995
the naughty people forever.

1803
01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:53.122
Forever?

1804
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.709
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1805
01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.176
[Zoe] Remember. we can't trust anyone.

1806
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.804
[device beeping]

1807
01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:08.846
I've got a signal.

1808
01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:10.807
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1809
01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:15.520
We're close.

1810
01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:16.646
[Fred] Hey. Chief.

1811
01:36:18.147 --> 01:36:19.232
Fred.

1812
01:36:20.858 --> 01:36:22.777
I'll let the team know that you're back.

1813
01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.945
[Callum] How about you don't.

1814
01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:30.493
Shapeshifters.

1815
01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:32.453
Good tidings.

1816
01:36:38.376 --> 01:36:40.420
It says he should be right here.

1817
01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:46.217
The old tunnel system.

1818
01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:48.845
Runs right beneath
the Original Workshop.

1819
01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:50.930
Let's go.

1820
01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:54.392
Is this happening
because I was ditching?

1821
01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.643
- What?
- Is it because

1822
01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:56.853
I slashed Kevin's tires?

1823
01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:59.022
No. no. no. no. no. no. Dylan.

1824
01:36:59.105 --> 01:37:00.815
You said it was for
naughty people. didn't you?

1825
01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:01.899
Well. she said that. but--

1826
01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:03.609
- What did I do?
- [Jack] Dylan.

1827
01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:05.111
Look at me.

1828
01:37:06.404 --> 01:37:08.740
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1829
01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:10.742
Everybody does.

1830
01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.535
Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1831
01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:14.996
You're only in here...

1832
01:37:16.956 --> 01:37:17.999
because of me.

1833
01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:21.544
What did you do?

1834
01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:24.130
Mmm. A lot of stuff.

1835
01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:25.965
It's a long list.

1836
01:37:28.134 --> 01:37:30.386
But bigger than any of that.
it's what I didn't do.

1837
01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:32.722
What are you talking about?

1838
01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:41.064
I've been a terrible father.

1839
01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:43.816
It's not true.

1840
01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.735
Yes. it is. It is.

1841
01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:47.195
I haven't been around.

1842
01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:50.490
I told myself I was doing you a favor.
which is bullshit.

1843
01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:52.158
It was bad for you.

1844
01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:53.618
And it was terrible for me.

1845
01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:57.497
I've made some mistakes. pal.
I know that.

1846
01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:00.625
But I also know
that I can do better.

1847
01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:03.836
And I know that's easier said than done.

1848
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.173
I know it's a lot of work
and I hope it's not too late.

1849
01:38:10.676 --> 01:38:12.345
Every day.

1850
01:38:12.428 --> 01:38:13.930
every decision.

1851
01:38:14.013 --> 01:38:15.390
is an opportunity.

1852
01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.395
And I want to start
taking some of those.

1853
01:38:22.105 --> 01:38:23.856
So. I'm not asking you
to believe me.

1854
01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.110
I'm just asking for you
to give me a chance.

1855
01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:30.321
I know I may never be

1856
01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:32.240
the greatest father in the world.

1857
01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:34.200
but I know I can do better.

1858
01:38:34.283 --> 01:38:36.953
And I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1859
01:38:38.037 --> 01:38:39.414
I will never stop trying.

1860
01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:44.919
[glass breaking]

1861
01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:00.351
[Jack sighs]

1862
01:39:06.566 --> 01:39:07.608
What just happened?

1863
01:39:12.155 --> 01:39:13.948
I think it just got a little bit nicer.

1864
01:39:15.324 --> 01:39:16.492
Can we get out of here?

1865
01:39:16.576 --> 01:39:17.493
Yeah.

1866
01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:20.288
First. we gotta find somebody.
Come on.

1867
01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:29.672
[Callum grunts]

1868
01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:30.923
- Ow.
- [sighs in relief]

1869
01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:32.258
Cal!

1870
01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:34.927
If you could make any toy in the world

1871
01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:36.137
real right now.
what would it be?

1872
01:39:38.764 --> 01:39:39.724
Wonder Woman.

1873
01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:42.226
It's him. You all right?

1874
01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:43.936
Yeah. yeah.

1875
01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:45.897
It's good to see you.

1876
01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:47.523
[Dylan] Dad?

1877
01:39:49.233 --> 01:39:51.777
Buddy. come here.
I want you to meet some friends.

1878
01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:53.988
Cal. Zoe. this is my son Dylan.

1879
01:39:55.114 --> 01:39:56.449
The one and only Dylan.

1880
01:39:56.908 --> 01:39:58.242
Your dad's told me
so much about you.

1881
01:40:00.411 --> 01:40:01.913
Welcome to the North Pole.

1882
01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:03.831
Huh?

1883
01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:04.916
I can't believe she got

1884
01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:06.584
the old Quatuplicator
back online again.

1885
01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:07.793
This thing has been
out of commission

1886
01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:09.045
since the late 1800s.

1887
01:40:09.128 --> 01:40:11.255
This thing was cranking out
snow globes like rat turds

1888
01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:13.341
and it just stopped.
like somebody pulled the plug.

1889
01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:14.258
Cal. we saw her.

1890
01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:16.511
She said she was
gonna do The Ride herself.

1891
01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:17.637
What?

1892
01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.555
Deliver one of these snow globes
to everybody on The List.

1893
01:40:19.639 --> 01:40:22.225
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1894
01:40:22.308 --> 01:40:23.559
Without him.

1895
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.144
We can't let that sleigh take off!

1896
01:40:27.063 --> 01:40:29.357
There's a subterranean
access point in the hanger.

1897
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.483
- [faint shouting]
- [muffled banging]

1898
01:40:30.566 --> 01:40:31.526
[Dylan] Wait.

1899
01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:34.570
[shouting and banging continues]

1900
01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:39.450
[growls]

1901
01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:40.535
Chief!

1902
01:40:40.618 --> 01:40:42.078
Garcia.

1903
01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:43.162
[Mrs. Claus] Cal.

1904
01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:47.792
Ma'am.

1905
01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:50.086
Where is he?

1906
01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:52.630
[sinister music playing]

1907
01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:08.854
- [reindeer grunting]
- [Lads groaning]

1908
01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:20.408
Gryla! Stop!

1909
01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.045
I was just leaving.

1910
01:41:33.129 --> 01:41:34.213
[Lads yelling]

1911
01:41:35.131 --> 01:41:36.007
Go. Take him.

1912
01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:37.425
[Mrs. Claus] Come with me. Dylan.
I got him.

1913
01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:38.426
[Garcia roars]

1914
01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:40.970
[reindeer neighing]

1915
01:41:43.556 --> 01:41:44.557
[electricity crackling]

1916
01:41:53.983 --> 01:41:54.817
[Gryla] Come on!

1917
01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:56.736
- [reindeer neighing]
- Go!

1918
01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:03.367
[Garcia roars]

1919
01:42:06.162 --> 01:42:07.163
[lad screaming]

1920
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.374
[roaring]

1921
01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:17.632
Ha!

1922
01:42:20.926 --> 01:42:21.927
[Callum grunts]

1923
01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:23.012
[Gryla shouts]

1924
01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.042
[grunting and groaning]

1925
01:42:56.879 --> 01:42:57.880
[both straining]

1926
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:00.591
[Jack screaming]

1927
01:43:01.884 --> 01:43:02.802
[grunts]

1928
01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:27.326
[Jack thuds. grunts]

1929
01:43:46.929 --> 01:43:48.222
[grunting]

1930
01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.066
[Gryla straining]

1931
01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:02.069
[Gryla screaming]

1932
01:44:22.173 --> 01:44:23.174
[grunts]

1933
01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:29.972
Nick! Come on. buddy. I got you.

1934
01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:34.310
[groans]

1935
01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:41.817
[Callum] Red!

1936
01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:44.487
Come back to me.
Come back to me. boss.

1937
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:45.988
Wake up.

1938
01:44:49.074 --> 01:44:51.994
[Callum] Nick! Nick! It's Cal.

1939
01:44:53.078 --> 01:44:54.079
[metallic rumbling]

1940
01:45:01.504 --> 01:45:03.589
[sinister music playing]

1941
01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:06.842
Cal!

1942
01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:19.814
Holy shit!

1943
01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:22.942
Jack.

1944
01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:28.489
Run.

1945
01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:30.574
No way. man.

1946
01:45:31.367 --> 01:45:33.536
For a guy like me.
there're worse ways to go out

1947
01:45:33.619 --> 01:45:35.329
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

1948
01:45:38.791 --> 01:45:39.792
Gryla!

1949
01:45:40.918 --> 01:45:42.086
It's time for you to go!

1950
01:45:43.796 --> 01:45:48.926
[Gryla] Oh. I'll go.
But I'm taking him with me.

1951
01:45:49.885 --> 01:45:51.846
You're not taking him anywhere.

1952
01:45:52.388 --> 01:45:55.975
His power has been wasted
for far too long.

1953
01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:59.186
The punishing begins tonight.

1954
01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.857
You're gonna have to
go through me first.

1955
01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.233
With pleasure.

1956
01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:06.110
[Gryla groans]

1957
01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.862
[rhythmic chanting]

1958
01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.781
[rhythmic chanting continues]

1959

[heroic music playing]

1960
01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:21.876
[groaning]

1961
01:46:25.337 --> 01:46:27.423
You imbeciles have no idea

1962
01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:29.633
