00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.189
Ilya Rozanov?

3
00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.193
Shane Hollander.
I... I wanted to introduce myself.

4
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.703
Oh. I'm... I'm not sure
you're supposed to smoke here.

5
00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.085
OK.

6
00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.383
You're an awesome
player to watch.

7
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.593
Yes.

8
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.737
Anyways. I... I should go.
They're waiting for me.

9
00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.323
But. um. good luck
in the tournament.

10
00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:23.291
You will not be so nice
when we beat you.

11
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.211
That's not happening.

12
00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.672
See you in final.

13
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.597
<i>It may be cold in Saskatchewan.</i>

14
00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.766
<i>but here at the
International Prospect Cup.</i>

15
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.185
<i>fans are hoping
for something hot on the ice.</i>

16
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.895
<i>a Canada-Russia final</i>

17
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.898
<i>showcasing the two most talked
about prospects in the world:</i>

18
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.609
<i>Canada's Shane Hollander
and Russia's Ilya Rozanov.</i>

19
00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.862
<i>First. you've got Ottawa's
own Shane Hollander.</i>

20
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.863
<i>From everything
we've seen and heard.</i>

21
00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.573
<i>he may not be the most sociable.</i>

22
00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.868
<i>but this is the kid with
the highest hockey IQ out there.</i>

23
00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:02.247
<i>Incredibly smart.
incredibly dedicated to the game</i>

24
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.332
<i>and incredibly fast.</i>

25
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.419
<i>And that shot!</i>

26
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.341
<i>Then you've got
Russia's Ilya Rozanov.</i>

27
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.593
<i>Strong on the puck
and a strong skater.</i>

28
00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.595
<i>And from everything we've heard.</i>

29
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.889
<i>he really gets under
other players' skins.</i>

30
00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.599
<i>Good in his own room.</i>

31
00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:24.060
<i>not exactly liked
in his opponent's room.</i>

32
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:27.564
<i>-My kind of player.
-Boston's kind of player too.</i>

33
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.736
Rozanov! Is there something
more important going on?

34
00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.162
<i>A heartbreaking loss
for a young Canadian team</i>

35
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.164
<i>still searching for an identity</i>

36
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.748
<i>despite an incredible showing</i>

37
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.543
<i>from the teenage phenom
Shane Hollander.</i>

38
00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.205
<i>He just couldn't get past
that elite Russian defense.</i>

39
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.672
<i>And more importantly.</i>

40
00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.175
<i>Ilya Rozanov
kept getting past theirs.</i>

41
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.760
See you at the draft.

42
00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.324
All right. boys.
looking over here.

43
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.617
Flash me those numbers.

44
00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.076
Ha! Number three's excited.

45
00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.745
There's one.
Where's number two?

46
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.246
There we go.

47
00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.082
Can I get a smile please?

48
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.585
Yeah. that's better!
All right.

49
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.421
I can't tell you how excited
Montrealers are about this.

50
00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.298
We don't care
he came number two.

51
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.634
People are popping champagne
all over Quebec.

52
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.762
Oh. and. uh. just to be clear.

53
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.641
uh. we are thrilled that Shane
is Asian. or Asian-Canadian.

54
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:45.892
Very thrilled.

55
00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.186
I mean. we've historically
broken barriers.

56
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.531
and we're doing it again.

57
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.207
so nothing to worry about there.

58
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.607
Oh. You certainly have.

59
00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.108
And. I mean. to be a part of

60
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.527
the most legendary franchise
in hockey. right?

61
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:57.820
Oh. my!

62
00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.155
It's. uh...

63
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.658
I'm still in shock.
but. uh. I... I'm so excited.

64
00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.828
And I know this came up
in Shane's interview.

65
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.813
but I am the world's
biggest Metros fan.

66
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.956
Really?

67
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.875
It's part of how
I came to feel Canadian.

68
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.461
My dad would sit us down in
the living room Saturday nights.

69
00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.051
We're not passing on a kid
this strong with those hands.

70
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.493
not in Boston. Mr. Rozanov.

71
00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.513
He's a very natural
number one pick.

72
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.181
Congratulations again. Ilya.

73
00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.976
He is strong.
but he needs discipline.

74
00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.396
He can be. how you say. lazy.

75
00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:35.692
I find that hard to believe.
the way he plays!

76
00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.111
I promise to work
very hard for you.

77
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.029
I have no doubt you will. son.

78
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:43.283
You listen. Don't speak.
You understand?

79
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.534
Yes.

80
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.091
Ah!

81
00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:24.986
Whoo!

82
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.532
What a fucking day. huh?

83
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.325
Yeah. totally.

84
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.702
Mmm.

85
00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.997
It's everything you dreamed of?

86
00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.540
Almost.

87
00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:41.544
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.797
No. you're not.

89
00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:51.304
Montreal is...
It's nice. yes?

90
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.805
Yeah. it's awesome.

91
00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:56.559
Boston is nice too?

92
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:58.728
I think so.

93
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.605
People like it there.

94
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.902
We will. uh... we will be
seeing each other a lot.

95
00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:12.742
Yeah. Boston and Montreal
play against each other often.

96
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.784
More...

97
00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.136
Hmm.

98
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.366
THE COLONEL

99
00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:44.458
What the fuck is going on?
Why is Dad calling me?

100
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.962
<i>Baby brother.
happy New Year for you. right?</i>

101
00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.714
Happy New Year. Alexei. but.

102
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.424
How's it going. handsome boy?

103
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.301
<i>What is going on with Dad?</i>

104
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.762
What the fuck are you
talking about? Dad is fine.

105
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.346
<i>He keeps calling me.</i>

106
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:00.391
'Cause you lost
a fucking hockey game. idiot.

107
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.477
What the fuck
do you want from me. Alexei?

108
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.521
<i>Let me think about it!</i>

109
00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.232
Can I have more money?

110
00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:09.859
<i>Please.</i>

111
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.361
I have no more money. Alexei!

112
00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.864
My bonus is done. man.
You snorted most of it!

113
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:18.701
<i>Wah-wah. you whiny faggot.</i>

114
00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:20.286
Go fuck yourself.

115
00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.038
Go fuck yourself. bitch.

116
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:31.631
Hello. Father.

117
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.300
<i>And so he answers!</i>

118
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.468
I'm sorry. Father.

119
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.219
<i>Apologize to Russia.</i>

120
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.765
<i>Losing to the Czechs.
Disgusting.</i>

121
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.256
We will beat Sweden. Father.

122
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.517
<i>Beat Sweden?</i>

123
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.144
<i>You will have to!
Otherwise. you will.</i>

124
00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:47.813
Not play for good.
I know. Father.

125
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.691
We are all trying.

126
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.568
<i>I don't care about "we"!</i>

127
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.780
<i>You! You will not lose to him.</i>

128
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.282
<i>What a comeback for Canada!</i>

129
00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.993
<i>A huge win for
the hometown boys tonight.</i>

130
00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:04.455
<i>who were determined to not
lose to Russia on home ice</i>

131
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.748
<i>two years in a row.</i>

132
00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:18.344
Good game. Good game.

133
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.804
See you in October.

134
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.765
Good game. Good game.

135
00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.065
That looks good.
Camera. you're happy with that?

136
00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.859
All right. that's perfect.
Give us a second.

137
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.113
We'll be good to go. OK?

138
00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.903
Just stay there.
Hold. please. Thank you.

139
00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:36.946
You look pretty.

140
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.197
You're wearing makeup too.

141
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.699
Yeah. but I don't look pretty.

142
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.242
Great. Can we do it again?

143
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.620
Can you guys try to hit
those marks at the same time?

144
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.539
Just skate out and skate in with
a lot of intensity. all right?

145
00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.457
-OK.
-Action!

146
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.796
Good. OK. let's do that
one more time.

147
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.800
Great. OK. one more time.

148
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:00.302
Great. OK!

149
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.138
Guys. just hold there
for a second.

150
00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:04.474
We're gonna make a little tweak
here with the camera.

151
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.508
I'll let you know when
we're ready to go.

152
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.811
In 3. 2. 1. and go ahead.

153
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.147
OK. I get it. guys.

154
00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.066
-It's been a long day. I know.
-Sorry.

155
00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.942
Try with a lot
of intensity. though.

156
00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.152
-OK?
-OK.

157
00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.323
OK. One more time. guys.

158
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.160
The more serious we can do.
the quicker we go home. Go.

159
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:26.829
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:27.830
OK.

161
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.833
Oh. I can do it. I promise.

162
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.835
And three. two. one. go ahead.

163
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.505
OK.

164
00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.175
OK. I think we have what
we are gonna get here.

165
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.509
Thanks. guys!

166
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.970
When they tell you
you do commercial with me

167
00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.221
and not just alone?

168
00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:47.016
I don't know.
like. two days ago?

169
00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:51.228
Why? When did they tell you?

170
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.522
No. they told me nothing.
It was my idea.

171
00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.152
Shane!

172
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.489
Shane. are you listening to me?

173
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.865
What? Yeah.

174
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.575
OK. so what did I just say?

175
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.035
Sneakers. I heard.

176
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.537
OK. you have to be seen
in your Reeboks.

177
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.871
I know. Mom.

178
00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.415
Because you cannot
be in anything else.

179
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.958
Mom. I'm always wearing skates.

180
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.542
But in case you're not.

181
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:15.128
This is a lot of money. Shane.

182
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.754
You're the youngest
hockey player

183
00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.256
they've ever signed to a deal.

184
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.883
And remember
what else this means.

185
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.551
I remember.

186
00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:24.971
A whole lot of kids are
gonna be looking up to you.

187
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.306
kids that don't
see themselves here a lot.

188
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.849
I get it. Mom.

189
00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:21.527
Fuck off.

190
00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.477
Not here.

191
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:08.157
So. uh. look. we can forget
that happened in there. OK?

192
00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:12.328
Is what you want?

193
00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.663
Yeah. for sure.

194
00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.544
Oh. wow.
You are a really bad liar.

195
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.474
What is your room number?

196
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.688
1410.

197
00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:46.278
Well. if I come
to 1410 tonight at 9:00...

198
00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.448
I might open.

199
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.201
I might knock.

I'm not. I'm not a chicken.

226
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.379
But I think we should talk.

227
00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.800
Do you want to sit?

228
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:34.219
Mmm. not really.

229
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.140

231
00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.524
Fuck. Hollander.

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:06.061
Oh. stop. stop. stop.

233
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.146
Was that bad?

234
00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:10.023
Ah. no. opposite.

235
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.900
Is too much. too good.

236
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.657
Is your first time with a man?

237
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:21.076
You?

238
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.703
No.

239
00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:24.997
Really?

240
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.415
Really.

241
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.334
Who? Another player?

242
00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:35.799
No. my coach's son
back in Russia.

243
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:41.263
I like trouble.

244
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.183
Weren't you scared
of getting caught?

245
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.267
No.

246
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.394
It was nothing serious.

247
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:51.231
and we had the same secret.
so it was just...

248
00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:53.609
Curious?

249
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.278
Curious.

250
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.615
And you make me curious.

251
00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.829
Do I make you curious?

252
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.540
Obviously.

253
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.128
Did you like sucking my cock?

254
00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:18.008
Wow. Those English words
just roll off your tongue.

255
00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.593
Yes?

256
00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:20.969
Yes.

257
00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:24.264
You want me to. uh.

258
00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:27.017
lie on the bed
and let you do it some more?

259
00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.269
-Let me?
-Yeah.

260
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.988
Uh. not fair.

261
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.490
Come on. I want to see you.

262
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.367
You saw me in the showers.

263
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.993
Yeah. I want more.

264
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.362
OK.

265
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:22.781
Come here.

266
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:39.047
So what do you want to do?

267
00:21:40.173 --> 00:21:41.717
I don't know.

268
00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.437
Is this OK?

269
00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.091
<i>Da.</i> like that. Hollander.

270
00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:35.854
Fuck. Hollander.

271
00:22:47.282 --> 00:22:50.369
Ah. fuck. Oh.

272
00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.456
Not bad for first time.

273
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.666
Fuck you. Rozanov.

274
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:01.088
OK. It was fun.

275
00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:03.715
Are you serious?

276
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.883
What?

277
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.969
What? You need something?

278
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:21.066
You think I am asshole?

279
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.567
I know you're an asshole.

280
00:23:22.692 --> 00:23:25.237
Oh. I would not
leave you like that.

281
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.072
No?

282
00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:28.740
No.

283
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.078
Let me show you
how to do this. kid.

284
00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:44.840
Holy shit. Rozanov.

285
00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:49.970
Oh. fuck.

286
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.601
Holy shit. Rozanov.
you better get off.

287
00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:57.018
I'm... I can't stop.

288
00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:59.271
Oh. fuck!

289
00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:00.814
Rozanov. fuck. fuck. fuck.

290
00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.857
Oh my God.

291
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:03.859
Oh. fuck.

292
00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:05.694
Oh my God.

293
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:13.118
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
I... I didn't think.

294
00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:15.370
What? That you would
come so quick?

295
00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:17.080
Fuck you.

296
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.793
You didn't have to.

297
00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:24.087
I don't mind.

298
00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:37.225
This is. uh...

299
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.437
Yes.

300
00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:42.522
Yes. yes. yes.

301
00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.736
God. I want a cigarette.

302
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:49.571
Smoking is bad for you.

303
00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:51.781
Oh. is it?

304
00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:55.911
So...

305
00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:59.915
you're not gonna tell
anyone about this. are you?

306
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.249
Me?

307
00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:03.585
Yes. Hollander.
I'm going to tell everyone.

308
00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:04.874
'Cause no one can know.

309
00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:12.219
Hollander. look.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

310
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.222
-OK?
-OK.

311
00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:26.233
I. uh. I have early
flight tomorrow. so...

312
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.984
Yeah. me too.

313
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.314
Good night.

314
00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:08.733
Night.

315
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.664
Holy shit!

316
00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.934
<i>How are you feeling</i>

317
00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:44.603
<i>about finally getting
to Montreal tomorrow?</i>

318
00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:46.271
<i>Good. About time.</i>

319
00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:48.482
<i>Are you looking forward to
beating Shane Hollander?</i>

320
00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:50.066
<i>Uh. he is goalie now. yes?</i>

321
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:52.027
<i>Ilya. at the beginning
of the year.</i>

322
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:54.279
<i>you said you would score
40 goals your rookie season.</i>

323
00:26:54.362 --> 00:26:55.948
<i>You still feel
that's going to happen?</i>

324
00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:57.907
No. no. I never said 40 goals.

325
00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.160
It's a lie. Liar told you that.

326
00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.828
I said 50.

327
00:27:03.747 --> 00:27:05.332
What a fucking asshole.

328
00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.768
Ah!

329
00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:26.227
Sorry I'm late.

330
00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.355
It's 15 minutes.
Don't even worry about it.

331
00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:30.975
We don't care. It's just that
you're usually on time.

332
00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.734
My workout went
longer than expected.

333
00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.486
and I got lost
in a YouTube rabbit hole.

334
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:36.822
It's fine. I ordered for you.
Salmon. brown rice.

335
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:37.906
-Thanks.
-OK.

336
00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:40.200
So. I have very exciting news.

337
00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:41.493
What's YouTube?

338
00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:43.703
Rolex is in.

339
00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:44.996
Wow!

340
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.581
Let me pull up the email.

341
00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.584
And I quote...

342
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.713
"Shane is exactly the kind
of young athlete and young man

343
00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.924
"that Rolex wants to
be associated with.

344
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:58.802
He's smart. he's serious.
he's handsome."

345
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:01.388
-That's an understatement.
-God. Mom.

346
00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.223
"And we believe he will be

347
00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:07.519
hockey's most significant
ambassador in a generation."

348
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:09.187
Is Rolex on YouTube?

349
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.232
YouTube is like
a video portal site.

350
00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.068
I'm not convinced I know
what any of those words mean.

351
00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.195
So. a rabbit hole
is where you watch a video.

352
00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:18.530
it recommends other videos.

353
00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:19.615
and you keep clicking them.

354
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:20.532
Sounds dangerous.

355
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:21.950
Oh. yeah.

356
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:23.744
I go down those rabbit
holes all the time.

357
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.036
Of course you do. Mom.

358
00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:26.705
-What was yours about?
-Fancy watches?

359
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.748
-David!
-What? I'm just keeping up.

360
00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.459
Unlikely animals
becoming friends.

361
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:34.212
like a tiger and a bear.
a cow and a duck.

362
00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:35.088
Come on!

363
00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.631
Yeah. a snake and a baby.

364
00:28:36.756 --> 00:28:38.800
I'd watch that.

365
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:41.362
Well. what you
should be watching

366
00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:42.762
are the ones about hockey.

367
00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.765
I think keeping up
with that snake and baby

368
00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:46.141
sounds pretty important.

369
00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:48.310
Relationship could go sideways
pretty fast.

370
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:51.479
Oh. I saw a link today
about Ilya Rozanov.

371
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:53.440
So I click on it. and he says...

372
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.941
Well. first of all.

373
00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.818
do you remember at
the beginning of the season.

374
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.570
he told someone.
I can't remember who...

375
00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:01.031
Anyway. he told them that
he was gonna score 40 goals.

376
00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.282
Do you remember that?

377
00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.742
I remember you yelling something

378
00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:05.160
about Rozanov turning 40

379
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.412
and me trying to match
your level of outrage.

380
00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:10.415
Well. yesterday in Boston.
he said he meant 50.

381
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.375
50 goals!

382
00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.961
Yeah. he's an asshole.

383
00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.838
Yeah. the nerve. Fuck him!

384
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.548
I'm sorry. but I mean it.

385
00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:21.551
OK. imagining he's better
than Gretzky? Better than you?

386
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:25.138
Fuck him. Right up the butt.

387
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.014
Yuna!

388
00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:27.807
I'm sorry. but I said it.

389
00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:29.267
Honestly!

390
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:33.980
<i>Desjardins talking to
McCann and St. Pierre.</i>

391
00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:35.816
<i>It's probably the last
face-off of the game.</i>

392
00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:37.817
<i>Who are they sending in?</i>

393
00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:40.862
<i>The crowd seems to have ideas.</i>

394
00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:44.282
<i>Are they gonna do this?</i>

395
00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:47.118
<i>Are they gonna give the people
what they want?</i>

396
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.950
<i>Desjardins is gonna
give it to them.</i>

397
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.872
<i>Is Reilly gonna do this too?</i>

398
00:29:50.997 --> 00:29:52.874
<i>Are we gonna see...</i>

399
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.918
<i>Listen to that crowd.</i>

400
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.628
<i>And there you have it!</i>

401
00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:59.547
<i>It's Ilya Rozanov versus...</i>

402
00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:01.299
Shane Hollander.

403
00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:03.718
Will you disappoint them?

404
00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:06.221
No.

405
00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:08.473
<i>But a goal off the face-off?
Your first against Rozanov?</i>

406
00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:10.225
<i>That had to have
felt pretty good?</i>

407
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.727
<i>I'm happy with
any goal I can get.</i>

408
00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.354
<i>But one off of Rozanov?</i>

409
00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:17.065
<i>Again. I'm happy with any goal.</i>

410
00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:18.608
<i>And the face-offs?</i>

411
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:22.070
<i>I'm here for the team.
I'm here to win.</i>

412
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:23.749
<i>I don't care about the details.</i>

413
00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:25.449
<i>And what do you think
about being compared</i>

414
00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:27.367
<i>to Tiger Woods
and Serena Williams?</i>

415
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.245
<i>Do you think you share
any of the same challenges?</i>

416
00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:33.461
<i>I don't really think
about stuff like that.</i>

417
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.042
<i>I'm just super happy
to play for the Metros.</i>

418
00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.836
Mr. Hollander...

419
00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:41.381
How does it feel to be perfect?

420
00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:42.423
Fucking perfect.

421
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.384
Thanks for asking.

422
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.054
In fucking French.

423
00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.640
Twenty thousand dollars?

424
00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:52.183
<i>Yes. twenty thousand dollars.</i>

425
00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:55.937
I'm glad your hearing is OK.

426
00:30:56.062 --> 00:30:57.021
For what this time?

427
00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:58.982
For fuck you.

428
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.277
This is the last fucking time.

429
00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:03.778
Yeah. fine.

430
00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.280
And I'm not sending it tonight!

431
00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.489
<i>Why the fuck not?</i>

432
00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.616
It's. It's midnight here.
Alexei.

433
00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:11.494
You always have
some bullshit excuse. Ilya.

434
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.789
How's Dad?

435
00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:17.250
<i>What the fuck is up
with you and Dad?</i>

436
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.877
Jesus fucking Christ!
He is fine!

437
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.712
We can all live without you.

438
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.255
Go fuck yourself. Ilya.

439
00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.217
On the phone yesterday.

440
00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:29.095
he asked me
to bring home some bread.

441
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.641
Well. he is stupid!

442
00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:39.814
Good night. Alexei.

443
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:42.442
First thing
in the morning. Ilya.

444
00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:51.993
<i>Here we are
at the MLH All-Star Game.</i>

445
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.494
<i>and the theme this year</i>

446
00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.247
<i>is Team Hollander
versus Team Rozanov.</i>

447
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.498
<i>Oh. I'm sorry.
I read that wrong.</i>

448
00:31:57.624 --> 00:31:59.792
<i>It's Team North America
versus Team Europe.</i>

449
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.294
<i>It's not subtle.</i>

450
00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.796
<i>Anytime the league
can figure out a way</i>

451
00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:04.840
<i>to get these two kids
in each other's faces.</i>

452
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.341
<i>they're gonna do it.</i>

453
00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.552
Ilya. you're having
a legendary rookie season.

454
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:09.677
Both of you are.

455
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:11.555
You said you'd hit
50 goals this year.

456
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:14.432
You've had 28 so far. and we're
in the middle of February.

457
00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:16.768
You still thinking
about a 50-goal campaign?

458
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.190
Yes.

459
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.025
Shane. kind of the same to you.

460
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.777
You scored 31 goals.

461
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.362
Any chance you want to speculate

462
00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.239
as to how this season
will end up for you guys?

463
00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:30.823
No chance at all.

464
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.410
Question for Ilya first.
but it'll be the same for Shane.

465
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.495
Boston is an original six
legendary team

466
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.497
that's struggled
to get to the playoffs

467
00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.744
for the past 3 seasons.

468
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.458
How much pressure do you feel
from the fans.

469
00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:42.043
from the hockey world
in general.

470
00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.337
to restore Boston
to its former glory?

471
00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:47.131
And how much of that do
you take on personally?

472
00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:50.593
Um...

473
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:51.594
Uh...

474
00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.012
Um...

475
00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:55.682
Sorry. not to jump the gun here.

476
00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.309
but with Rozanov's permission...

477
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:03.022
I know it's only been
two seasons

478
00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.857
since Montreal's
made the playoffs.

479
00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.567
but I think I get the idea.

480
00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:10.697
So. look. my mom is
the world's biggest Metros fan.

481
00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:11.948
She's obsessed.

482
00:33:12.073 --> 00:33:13.449
And like all Metros fans.

483
00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:16.077
she wants us to be back
in the playoffs regularly.

484
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:17.829
and she wants us
to win some cups.

485
00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:19.747
And I want the same thing.

486
00:33:19.914 --> 00:33:23.126
I want to be in the playoffs.
and I want to win some cups.

487
00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.086
I feel pretty aligned
with the fans.

488
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.879
'cause we want the same thing.

489
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.757
And at this point. it's my job
to take that personally.

490
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.301
Ilya?

491
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.723
What he said.

492
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.979
<i>And here's the
shot accuracy competition.</i>

493
00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:46.190
<i>featuring. gasp. Shane Hollander
and Ilya Rozanov.</i>

494
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.401
<i>The record for this event.</i>

495
00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:51.112
<i>currently held by the
New York Admiral's Scott Hunter.</i>

496
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:53.698
<i>is 4 takedowns in 8 seconds.</i>

497
00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:57.535
Come on!

498
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.246
<i>And Rozanov breaks the record.
There you go!</i>

499
00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.040
<i>He's a big kid with a big shot.</i>

500
00:34:07.628 --> 00:34:09.756
<i>That was something else.
I'll tell you that!</i>

501
00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.299
Let's go!

502
00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:12.842
<i>Shane Hollander just shaved
over a second</i>

503
00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:15.762
<i>off the record
that Ilya Rozanov just set.</i>

504
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.838
<i>If that isn't a good night
and good luck.</i>

505
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.766
<i>I don't know what is.</i>

506
00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:23.144
Good job.

507
00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:25.063
Thanks.

508
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.648
You have fun last night?

509
00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:28.816
Last night?

510
00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:30.151
With your team.

511
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.361
Get dinner. get drunk?

512
00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:35.281
Oh. yeah. I mean. I had fun.
but I didn't get drunk.

513
00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:39.660
You?

514
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.204
Yeah. it was great.

515
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:44.248
No boring Canadians.
no stupid Americans.

516
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.001
So. what. just a bunch
of Finnish guys

517
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.377
talking about the cousins
they're in love with?

518
00:34:50.838 --> 00:34:52.924
Think I'm going to bed
early tonight.

519
00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:54.383
Oh. yeah?

520
00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:59.430
1221.

521
00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:04.936
Nice shooting. rook.

522
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.479
Thanks.

523
00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:10.024
Glad to see Rozanov
didn't hold my record

524
00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:11.192
for more than a minute.

525
00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.152
What did he want. by the way?

526
00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.446
Oh. nothing. just shit-talking.

527
00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:17.073
He's an asshole. right?

528
00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:18.825
I mean. yeah. basically.

529
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.326
Lucky me.

530
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:23.204
I'm in the room next door
to him at the hotel.

531
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:25.123
Hollander!

532
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:44.892
Is someone chasing you?

533
00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:47.520
I'm standing in the hallway
like an idiot.

534
00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.814
Scott Hunter is right next door.

535
00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:54.735
Fuck.

536
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.413
Get on your knees.

537
00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.543
Oh my fucking...

538
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:54.837
Fuck. Rozanov.

539
00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:03.262
Get on your stomach.
On your stomach.

540
00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:11.479
Have you ever?

541
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.731
Do you want to?

542
00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:18.861
You're scared.

543
00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:20.196
I'm not scared.

544
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:21.280
No. it's OK.

545
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.823
I'm not scared.

546
00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:31.749
Do you ever touch yourself here?

547
00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:33.292
Jesus Christ.

548
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.796
What? Does touching your ass
make you gay?

549
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.005
Rozanov...

550
00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:39.966
'Cause you know what else
makes you gay

551
00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:40.976
is sucking my dick.

552
00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.551
Shut up.

553
00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:43.761
Fuck.

554
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:47.974
I'm trying to say
I have a thing. OK?

555
00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.392
A thing?

556
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:51.936
A dildo.

557
00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.025
What color?

558
00:37:58.192 --> 00:37:59.318
Fuck you.

559
00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.361
It's big?

560
00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:01.362
I'm leaving.

561
00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:02.530
No. no. Hollander.

562
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:04.532
I want to fuck you.

563
00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:14.000
Not here.

564
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:17.378
Not with fucking
Scott Hunter next door.

565
00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:19.505
He is hot.

566
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.341
We should let him listen
like mating call.

567
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.552
-You'd like that. wouldn't you?
-Mm-hmm.

568
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.554
You probably would too.

569
00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:32.977
OK. So next time.

570
00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.939
Next time?

571
00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:38.858
Yeah. we're playing
Montreal in two weeks.

572
00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:43.279
Yeah. But. um.
where would we...

573
00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:45.239
Where would we what?

574
00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:46.699
Meet?

575
00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.035
You are homeless?

576
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.119
No.

577
00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:51.496
Then we meet at your house.

578
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:52.997
It's an apartment.

579
00:38:54.081 --> 00:38:56.542
Hollander. you are having
a panic attack.

580
00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:02.798
It's just a plan to fuck.

581
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:31.702
Uh. I know we talked about
Montreal in two weeks. but...

582
00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.958
Oh my God. Hollander.
you are so boring.

583
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:41.462
Give me your phone.

584
00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:46.050
You have phone.

585
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.011
Give.

586
00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:08.906
So. what's my name gonna be?

587
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:09.990
Jane.

588
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:31.137
What's up with you?

589
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.680
Nothing.

590
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.182
You sure?

591
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.269
Fuck you.

592
00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:39.687
Hey. sorry. boys.

593
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:41.606
No one's getting
into Montreal today.

594
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:43.023
Two feet of snow.

595
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:45.192
Fuck. Fuck!

596
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.238
It's a night off. boy.
It's not the end of the world.

597
00:40:49.363 --> 00:40:50.739
Yeah. whatever.

598
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:53.701
Look. whoever she is.
she's gonna get over it.

599
00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:13.721
Hey. you. uh. you don't want
to come over to my place

600
00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:15.205
for dinner tonight. do you?

601
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.223
What?

602
00:41:16.348 --> 00:41:17.558
Since there's no game.

603
00:41:17.725 --> 00:41:19.310
Come for dinner.
Jacki said it's cool.

604
00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:22.354
Oh. that's my wife.
She can throw on some steaks.

605
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.064
I... I'm on a macrobiotic diet.

606
00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:26.692
Buddy. I don't even know
what that means.

607
00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:28.183
But Jacki can cook anything.

608
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:32.156
-You OK?
-Yeah. I guess.

609
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:35.076
Hey. if you have other plans.
that's... that's totally cool.

610
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:38.078
No. I want to watch you eat
my disgusting food. Let's do it.

611
00:41:38.245 --> 00:41:40.164
Fuck yes!
God. Jacki's gonna be so happy.

612
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:42.667
She's obsessed with being
the first wag to feed you.

613
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.085
I'm gonna text her
right now. actually.

614
00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:47.129
"Bird food only."

615
00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:22.665
Jesus Christ.

616
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.458
-Surprise!
-Svetlana!

617
00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:26.627
I thought you were
back in Russia!

618
00:42:27.127 --> 00:42:28.546
What the fuck
are you doing here?

619
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:31.465
Being nice.
but I already regret it.

620
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:32.967
Sounds like you.

621
00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:34.969
Go fuck yourself. Ilya.

622
00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:39.557
Sorry. I didn't expect you.

623
00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.226
-How did you know.
-That your game was cancelled?

624
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.019
It was announced. asshole.

625
00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:48.107
You don't deserve me.
I should go.

626
00:42:52.361 --> 00:42:54.655
OK. now I'm really leaving.
you piece of shit.

627
00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.782
Have fun with. Jane.

635
00:43:52.254 --> 00:43:54.923

indulge in front of you.

636
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:57.801
-Congrats. man.
-Thank you.

637
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:00.638
Uh. what would you say if. uh.

wanted to do some shots
with the three rooks?

640
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:05.810
Would you be into that?

641
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.102
Fuck yes. I would.

642
00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:08.729
OK. Then where's
your boy Rozanov?

643

My what?

644
00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.400
No. I mean. not your boy.

645
00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:16.862
Just. like. it's always. uh.
Hollander and Rozanov. right?

646
00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:17.905
I just thought...

647
00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:19.740
I don't know where he is.

648
00:44:19.865 --> 00:44:22.785
We're not. like.
friends or anything.

649
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.370
No worries. man.

650
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:27.206
No worries. I'm sure someone
else grabbed him.

651
00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:31.919
-OK!
-Fuck yes!

652
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:37.549

Yeah. well. it could have
gone to either one of us.

670
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.483
It went to you.

671
00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:41.113
So what?

672
00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.115
You're just up here sulking
because. what.

673
00:45:43.198 --> 00:45:45.617
you couldn't take
another victory lap around me?

674
00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.327
All you do is beat me.

675
00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:50.456
I win one fucking thing. and
you can't even show your face.

676
00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:54.960
-What was that?
-Not everything is about you!

677
00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:57.421
So what is it then?

678
00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.131
What the fuck do you want?

679
00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.509
Nothing. I just wanted to
see the view and get some air.

680
00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.511
And what? Here is
fucking view. Hollander.

681
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:06.013
Check it out. Fuck!

682
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.524
I go home in three days.

683
00:46:19.234 --> 00:46:20.360
OK.

684
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.988
That must be nice.

685
00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:43.217
And I guess
I thought maybe we...

686
00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:51.642
Never mind.

687
00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:54.186
OK. I'm gonna...

688
00:47:00.108 --> 00:47:04.112
I guess I'll. uh.
see you next season.

689
00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.062
What the fuck are you doing?

690
00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.398
We're both in tuxedos
out in public.

691
00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.440
No one is looking.

692
00:47:40.607 --> 00:47:42.025
You don't know that.

693
00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.499
See you next season!
