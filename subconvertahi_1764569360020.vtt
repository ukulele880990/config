2
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.010
<font color="#ff0000">I sense you. brother.</font>

3
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.710
<font color="#ff0000">Hiding...</font>

4
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.080
<font color="#ff0000">...Behind your cloak.</font>

5
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
<font color="#ff0000">It is time to earn yours.</font>

6
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.510
<font color="#ff0000">Still too small to take me head on.</font>

7
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.370
<font color="#ff0000">Use the cave!</font>

8
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.440
<font color="#ff0000">You fight with rage.</font>

9
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.220
<font color="#ff0000">I fight like father.</font>

10
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.220
<font color="#ff0000">You are not father. you are Dek!</font>

11
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.160
<font color="#ff0000">Do you yield?</font>

12
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.500
<font color="#ff0000">Never!</font>

13
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.420
<font color="#ff0000">Good.</font>

14
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.060
<font color="#ff0000">I'm still alive. brother.</font>

15
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.350
<font color="#ff0000">Still much to prove...</font>

16
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.940
<font color="#ff0000">...to show who you are.</font>

17
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.880
<font color="#ff0000">I am Yautja.</font>

18
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.690
<font color="#ff0000">Not yet.</font>

19
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.200
<font color="#ff0000">Are you holding your sword. Kwei?</font>

20
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.170
<font color="#ff0000">No.</font>

21
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.250
<font color="#ff0000">Pick it up!</font>

22
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.520
<font color="#ff0000">You kept this toy?!</font>

23
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.500
<font color="#ff0000">You remember what happened...</font>

24
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.710
<font color="#ff0000">I lost my fang!</font>

25
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.180
<font color="#ff0000">And you saved my life.</font>

26
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.320
<font color="#ff0000">You protected me.</font>

27
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.380
<font color="#ff0000">Come here.</font>

28
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.610
<font color="#ff0000">Fixed it for you.</font>

29
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.900
<font color="#ff0000">Don't blow yourself up.</font>

30
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.530
<font color="#ff0000">Today you make a vow...</font>

31
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.420
<font color="#ff0000">...as our ancestors did before you.</font>

32
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.950
<font color="#ff0000">To earn your place in the clan...</font>

33
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.450
<font color="#ff0000">...you must choose your prey.</font>

34
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.380
<font color="#ff0000">Bring it home...</font>

35
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.250
<font color="#ff0000">...or never return.</font>

36
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.740
<font color="#ff0000">Wait — Go back!</font>

37
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.490
<font color="#ff0000">Genna.</font>

38
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.430
<font color="#ff0000">The death planet.</font>

39
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.860
<font color="#ff0000">Home of the un-killable Kalisk.</font>

40
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
<font color="#ff0000">Even father fears it.</font>

41
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.340
<font color="#ff0000">Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.</font>

42
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.800
<font color="#ff0000">Father calls me the weakest...</font>

43
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.900
<font color="#ff0000">...so I must kill the strongest.</font>

44
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.620
<font color="#ff0000">Failure means death.</font>

45
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.430
<font color="#ff0000">Then I will not fail.</font>

46
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.540
<font color="#ff0000">I cannot allow it.</font>

47
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.660
<font color="#ff0000">I make my vow.</font>

48
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.300
<font color="#ff0000">I make my vow!</font>

49
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.850
<font color="#ff0000">Father.</font>

50
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.660
<font color="#ff0000">I welcome you with honor.</font>

51
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.280
<font color="#ff0000">Why is it not done?</font>

52
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.600
<font color="#ff0000">He deserves a hunt.</font>

53
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.910
<font color="#ff0000">He is our clan's weakness....</font>

54
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.370
<font color="#ff0000">...weaknesses must be culled.</font>

55
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.230
<font color="#ff0000">He will bring home the Kalisk.</font>

56
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.860
<font color="#ff0000">Foolishness.</font>

57
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.860
<font color="#ff0000">He is a runt.</font>

58
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.260
<font color="#ff0000">You should have done it as he slept.</font>

59
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.120
<font color="#ff0000">Kill him!</font>

60
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.180
<font color="#ff0000">Now!</font>

61
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.640
<font color="#ff0000">He will only honor us in death.</font>

62
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.130
<font color="#ff0000">Father.</font>

63
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.050
<font color="#ff0000">Kwei?</font>

64
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.410
<font color="#ff0000">Be brave. brother.</font>

65
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.520
<font color="#ff0000">Father!</font>

66
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.060
<font color="#ff0000">Kwei!!!</font>

67
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.390
<font color="#ff0000">To forgive weakness...</font>

68
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.030
<font color="#ff0000">...is to show weakness.</font>

69
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.230
<font color="#ff0000">No! Father. no!</font>

70
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.030
<font color="#ff0000">Get your sword!</font>

71
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.680
<font color="#ff0000">Kwei!!!</font>

72
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.840
<font color="#ff0000">Launch sequence initiated.</font>

73
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.190
<font color="#ff0000">Bring it home.</font>

74
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.730
<font color="#ff0000">Bring it home.</font>

75
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.350
<font color="#ff0000">For Kwei.</font>

76
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.980
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja!</font>

77
00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.927
Is this better?

78
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:06.611
Universal translation.

79
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:09.451
You hear Yautja. others hear their
language.

80
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:12.051
Oh boy.

81
00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:15.551
This isn't great for you.

82
00:22:39.873 --> 00:22:42.093
Then eat you while you can't move.

83
00:22:49.913 --> 00:22:51.273
I could help you. but...

84
00:22:53.213 --> 00:22:54.213
I need a hand.

85
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.900
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja hunt alone.</font>

86
00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:05.479
Yautja might hunt alone. but...

87
00:23:06.214 --> 00:23:07.394
may die alone too.

88
00:23:10.814 --> 00:23:11.814
Kalisk.

89
00:23:15.784 --> 00:23:16.875
You're hunting the Kalisk.

90
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:27.091
Excuse you. sir.

91
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.150
<font color="#ff0000">What happened to your legs?</font>

92
00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:31.812
I'm synthetic.

93
00:25:32.352 --> 00:25:35.472
I was built and deployed by the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation for research.

94
00:25:35.732 --> 00:25:38.352
Because their humans wouldn't last a day
on this planet.

95
00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:39.692
We found that...

96
00:25:46.322 --> 00:25:47.322
Look.

97
00:25:48.872 --> 00:25:51.283
Many Yautja have come for the Great
Kalisk.

98
00:25:52.203 --> 00:25:54.123
And none have survived it.

99
00:25:54.223 --> 00:25:55.223
Or Genna.

100
00:25:59.103 --> 00:26:00.103
I've seen the Kalisk.

101
00:26:01.523 --> 00:26:02.523
I survived it.

102
00:26:03.923 --> 00:26:04.923
Here's my proposal.

103
00:26:05.613 --> 00:26:08.924
You take me along with you. and I'll guide
you to its den.

104
00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:15.504
Once there. I get my legs. you get your
trophy. and everyone's a winner.

105
00:26:16.104 --> 00:26:17.104
Deal?

106
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.650
<font color="#ff0000">You have you seen the Kalisk?</font>

107
00:26:22.577 --> 00:26:23.577
Oh. yeah.

108
00:26:25.394 --> 00:26:26.394
I've seen the Kalisk.

109
00:26:42.595 --> 00:26:44.895
Good luck with your journey.

110
00:26:46.576 --> 00:26:47.576
I'm just gonna...

111
00:26:48.826 --> 00:26:49.826
go on my journey.

112
00:26:52.686 --> 00:26:54.166
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

113
00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.086
Hey!

114
00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:07.820
I've already shown you that I can be
useful to you.

115
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.970
<font color="#ff0000">Useful...</font>

116
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.760
<font color="#ff0000">...like tool?</font>

117
00:27:14.207 --> 00:27:15.207
Yes.

118
00:27:15.607 --> 00:27:17.127
Yes. Exactly.

119
00:27:17.247 --> 00:27:18.247
Like a tool.

120
00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:21.007
The only way to survive Genna is to work
with it.

121
00:27:21.107 --> 00:27:22.343
And I know how.

122
00:27:23.117 --> 00:27:25.608
And with the right tool...

123
00:27:27.758 --> 00:27:28.808
You could get the Kalisk.

124
00:27:29.908 --> 00:27:31.168
You could be the first.

125
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.090
<font color="#ff0000">I will use you. tool.</font>

126
00:27:37.168 --> 00:27:38.291
You may call me thief.

127
00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:47.139
And what does the chewing?

128
00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:48.959
Your outside veins. or your inner veins?

129
00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:49.979
Inside teeth.

130
00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:53.959
Oh. what should I call you?

131
00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:55.659
Hm?

132
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.030
How fast were you going when your ship
crashed?

133
00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:08.810
Faster than sublight speed?

134
00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:10.565
We haven't cracked that yet.

135
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.650
Also. that plasma sword is interesting.

136
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.260
Is it unique to your clan?

137
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.970
And what may I call you?

138
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.090
I call these Imbre Anguis.

139
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:32.881
We just got a snack.

140
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:43.472
You catch more flies with honey than you
do with vinegar.

141
00:28:45.472 --> 00:28:46.612
Drink my wine.
<font color="#ff0000">Don't want flies.</font>

142
00:28:47.942 --> 00:28:50.832
Predatory organisms are my specific area
of expertise.

143
00:28:51.762 --> 00:28:53.042
I've studied Yautja extensively.

144
00:28:54.162 --> 00:28:55.242
It's an impressive culture.

145
00:28:55.852 --> 00:28:57.272
Here. ask me anything.

146
00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:58.502
I bet I have the answer.

147
00:29:01.613 --> 00:29:02.613
Very funny.

148
00:29:03.313 --> 00:29:04.913
And you still haven't told me your name.

149
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.850
<font color="#ff0000">Name is Dek.</font>

150
00:29:29.144 --> 00:29:31.804
Okay. sure.
<font color="#ff0000">Now talk that way.</font>

151
00:29:35.054 --> 00:29:37.184
Well. let's back up and start at the
beginning.

152
00:29:56.856 --> 00:29:57.956
It's so beautiful.

153
00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:03.656
After all the time I've been stuck here.
I'm tired of the view.

154
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.940
<font color="#ff0000">How long have you been here?</font>

155
00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:07.676
When?

156
00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:11.196
Well. we arrived on Genna two years ago.
and we built a base.

157
00:30:11.766 --> 00:30:17.817
Then I was in the vulture's nest for the
most exciting 13 days. 7 hours.

158
00:30:18.307 --> 00:30:20.997
43 minutes. and 2 seconds of my life.

159
00:30:22.897 --> 00:30:24.377
But I always knew someone would come.

160
00:30:27.197 --> 00:30:28.277
I was just wrong about who.

161
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.160
<font color="#ff0000">Who would come?</font>

162
00:30:34.587 --> 00:30:35.588
Tessa.

163
00:30:37.793 --> 00:30:40.328
Our crew is made up entirely of synths.

164
00:30:41.403 --> 00:30:42.708
But Tessa and I are special.

165
00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:45.708
We have a higher sensitivity than the
others.

166
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.160
<font color="#ff0000">Sensitivity is weakness.</font>

167
00:30:52.258 --> 00:30:55.449
The sensitivity is what allows us to
understand the creatures on this planet.

168
00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:01.669
We were created to work in tandem.

169
00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:04.349
Me cooped up in the lab.

170
00:31:05.219 --> 00:31:06.219
Tessa out in the field.

171
00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:09.669
Until the wonderful day Tessa let me come
with her.

172
00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:11.749
We were exploring Genna.

173
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.350
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

174
00:31:18.565 --> 00:31:19.565
Separated me...

175
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.420
and us.

176
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.290
The last sound I remember
hearing... was Tessa...

177
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.240
calling out my name.

178
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.641
Reaching for me.

179
00:31:35.191 --> 00:31:36.191
Then the Kalisk.

180
00:31:38.161 --> 00:31:39.161
I didn't know what to do.

181
00:31:50.391 --> 00:31:52.942
But I refuse to believe she's dead.

182
00:32:29.143 --> 00:32:32.274
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...

183
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:36.735
Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia... Thia... Thia... Tessa!

184
00:32:38.454 --> 00:32:42.774
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia...

185
00:33:17.456 --> 00:33:24.006
Hello. Tessa.

186
00:33:24.906 --> 00:33:26.406
The company is not pleased.

187
00:33:29.327 --> 00:33:31.927
Continued failure will result in your
decommission.

188
00:33:36.267 --> 00:33:37.267
Where's Thia?

189
00:33:40.647 --> 00:33:42.367
The beauty has been.

190
00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.220
<font color="#ff0000">I must eat.</font>

191
00:33:56.778 --> 00:33:58.428
Two warriors... Dekin Thia.

192
00:33:58.648 --> 00:33:59.648
On the hunt.

193
00:34:01.548 --> 00:34:02.768
Quick question.

194
00:34:02.928 --> 00:34:04.649
What should I be doing?

195
00:34:09.189 --> 00:34:10.629
Don't worry. my son.
<font color="#ff0000">What is this creature?</font>

196
00:34:12.529 --> 00:34:15.129
Bone bison... they're Kalisk food.

197
00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:21.329
This is so exciting.
<font color="#ff0000">Then it will be my food. too.</font>

198
00:34:22.549 --> 00:34:23.890
Hunting with the Yautja?

199
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:25.450
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

200
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.830
Just a warning.

201
00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.180
<font color="#ff0000">Quiet tool!</font>

202
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.150
Razor grass.

203
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:39.970
It'll cut you the ribbons.

204
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.230
We'll just go around.

205
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.770
<font color="#ff0000">You give up too easily.</font>

206
00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:52.511
We might not be alone in this hunt.

207
00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:04.572
What an odd critter.

208
00:35:05.382 --> 00:35:06.462
I've never seen you before.

209
00:35:12.512 --> 00:35:13.512
Thia.

210
00:35:13.547 --> 00:35:14.547
Nice to meet you.

211
00:35:29.013 --> 00:35:30.833
Looks like your competition is better.

212
00:35:33.433 --> 00:35:34.433
Careful

213
00:35:49.354 --> 00:35:50.354
up in these trees.

214
00:35:50.634 --> 00:35:51.674
There are lunabugs.

215
00:36:06.235 --> 00:36:13.985
Coming up behind you.

216
00:36:28.096 --> 00:36:29.096
Stronger than it looks.

217
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.040
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk?</font>

218
00:37:30.189 --> 00:37:31.462
Not a Kalisk.

219
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.580
<font color="#ff0000">You give up too easily.</font>

220
00:40:37.269 --> 00:40:39.109
That was the best hunt I've ever been on.

221
00:40:39.409 --> 00:40:40.869
This is the dream team right here.

222
00:40:41.209 --> 00:40:42.129
The Dynamic Three.

223
00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:43.309
The Dynamic Trio.

224
00:40:43.624 --> 00:40:44.629
The Dynamic Trio!

225
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.930
Trio!

226
00:40:45.931 --> 00:40:47.371
Remember when we went down the tree?

227
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.910
That monster's mouth?
I mean... Uggh.

228
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.490
Didn't smell great. didn't smell great.
but...

229
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.290
...we got him.

230
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.690
We got him.

231
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.710
And then we met you. our little sweet
little little thing...

232
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.430
Thank you. Seriously.

233
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:01.650
For that experience.

234
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.870
Truly amazing.

235
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.391
Thrilling.
Truly thrilling.

236
00:41:05.511 --> 00:41:06.631
What was your favorite part?

237
00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:15.091
What was the smallest me appetizer you've
ever eaten?
<font color="#ff0000">When I pierced its head with my sword</font>

238
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.730
<font color="#ff0000">and its blood rushed down my face.</font>

239
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.050
<font color="#ff0000">This flesh is not sweet.</font>

240
00:41:46.218 --> 00:41:52.383
A little pause...

241
00:41:57.593 --> 00:41:59.253
and we are back.

242
00:41:59.273 --> 00:42:01.474
I think she's marking you.

243
00:42:02.784 --> 00:42:04.344
She wants you to be a part of her clan.

244
00:42:06.854 --> 00:42:07.854
Maybe she's lost.
<font color="#ff0000">I have no clan!</font>

245
00:42:10.254 --> 00:42:11.254
What do you mean?

246
00:42:12.394 --> 00:42:13.674
Don't all Yautja have family?

247
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.780
<font color="#ff0000">No clan.</font>

248
00:42:18.234 --> 00:42:19.954
So you never had anyone looking out for
you?

249
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.430
<font color="#ff0000">I had a brother.</font>

250
00:42:30.285 --> 00:42:31.285
What happened to him?

251
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.840
<font color="#ff0000">Father killed him.</font>

252
00:42:39.896 --> 00:42:40.896
You're grieving.

253
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.150
<font color="#ff0000">Grief is weakness.</font>

254
00:42:48.936 --> 00:42:50.736
You're here because you lost your brother.

255
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.780
<font color="#ff0000">I am here for Kalisk.</font>

256
00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.170
<font color="#ff0000">Why are you here?</font>

257
00:43:04.337 --> 00:43:07.667
I'm here because traveling with you is the
best way to get back to Tessa.

258
00:43:10.407 --> 00:43:14.588
When I was in that vulture's nest. I
was so afraid I would never see her again.

259
00:43:15.187 --> 00:43:17.227
So then you swiped for all I could.
<font color="#ff0000">You should be able to survive on your own.</font>

260
00:43:19.758 --> 00:43:21.068
I can survive on my own.

261
00:43:23.478 --> 00:43:25.158
But who would want to survive on their
own?

262
00:43:30.698 --> 00:43:32.918
Delay us all horror. Tessa.
<font color="#ff0000">Tessa is your sister.</font>

263
00:43:37.639 --> 00:43:38.639
Sister.

264
00:43:39.339 --> 00:43:40.339
Huh.

265
00:43:41.629 --> 00:43:42.629
Yeah.

266
00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:44.969
I guess she is.

267
00:43:47.609 --> 00:43:49.689
I have... a sister.

268
00:43:53.484 --> 00:43:54.484
What a lovely thought.

269
00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.520
I need to find her.

270
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.260
I need to find her.
<font color="#ff0000">And legs.</font>

271
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.369
Excuse me?

272
00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.600
<font color="#ff0000">Finding your sister</font>

273
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.100
<font color="#ff0000">And legs.</font>

274
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:17.112
Was that a joke?

275
00:47:32.721 --> 00:47:33.721
Fish wonder now.
<font color="#ff0000">The sun rises.</font>

276
00:47:34.171 --> 00:47:35.191
Where is Kiwi?
<font color="#ff0000">Let's go.</font>

277
00:47:36.051 --> 00:47:37.051
We can't leave Bud.

278
00:47:37.951 --> 00:47:39.371
- Bunt?
- Yeah.

279
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:40.691
Bud.

280
00:47:40.831 --> 00:47:41.871
I named her.

281
00:47:43.141 --> 00:47:44.992
Tessa Yautja I need to find her.
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja hunt alone.</font>

282
00:47:46.772 --> 00:47:47.772
You're not alone.

283
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:49.032
I'm with you.

284
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.000
<font color="#ff0000">You're a tool.</font>

285
00:47:58.627 --> 00:48:00.312
The tree would have eaten us without her.

286
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.520
<font color="#ff0000">We're not in the tree now.</font>

287
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.740
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk?</font>

288
00:49:09.436 --> 00:49:10.436
You're not alone.
<font color="#ff0000">It drinks here.</font>

289
00:49:13.616 --> 00:49:14.836
You're not alone.
<font color="#ff0000">It drinks here?</font>

290
00:49:19.036 --> 00:49:20.037
You're not alone.
<font color="#ff0000">You are a useless tool if you don't speak.</font>

291
00:49:28.217 --> 00:49:29.217
Bud saved us.

292
00:49:31.277 --> 00:49:33.587
She spit on you to claim you as part of
her family.

293
00:49:40.248 --> 00:49:42.008
Why'd your father kill your brother?

294
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.130
<font color="#ff0000">My brother was protecting me.</font>

295
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.990
<font color="#ff0000">The clan can have no weakness.</font>

296
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.290
<font color="#ff0000">I will show them strength.</font>

297
00:50:10.649 --> 00:50:11.649
On Earth...

298
00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:15.139
there's a predator known as the wolf.

299
00:50:16.024 --> 00:50:17.025
It's a powerful creature.

300
00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:21.570
They hunt in packs.

301
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:23.610
They're very loyal.

302
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:29.100
The leader of the pack is the Alpha.
known as the most dominant.

303
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.620
<font color="#ff0000">Wolf</font>

304
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.700
<font color="#ff0000">This alpha must be a great killer.</font>

305
00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.240
<font color="#ff0000">I will hunt it too.</font>

306
00:50:36.881 --> 00:50:37.881
No.

307
00:50:39.011 --> 00:50:42.241
The Alpha isn't the wolf who kills the
most.

308
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:48.361
The Alpha is actually the one who best
protects the pack.

309
00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.260
<font color="#ff0000">I see...</font>

310
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.060
<font color="#ff0000">But I will be the alpha that kills the most.</font>

311
00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.430
<font color="#ff0000">The Kalish's den?</font>

312
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.660
<font color="#ff0000">Who are they?</font>

313
00:52:11.315 --> 00:52:16.047
The Kalisk destroyed
most of our mission team.

314
00:52:19.617 --> 00:52:20.736
There am I.

315
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:06.030
<font color="#ff0000">Easier to walk now.</font>

316
00:53:06.534 --> 00:53:07.748
It's about to be.

317
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:09.540
<font color="#ff0000">No.</font>

318
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.260
<font color="#ff0000">Easier for me to walk now.</font>

319
00:53:12.149 --> 00:53:16.209
Oh. of course.

320
00:53:16.669 --> 00:53:17.669
Right.

321
00:53:20.189 --> 00:53:21.289
Thank you. Dek.

322
00:53:24.719 --> 00:53:25.959
I'm never going to forget this.

323
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.690
<font color="#ff0000">I too will remember this...</font>

324
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.640
<font color="#ff0000">...today I become Dek of the Yautja.</font>

325
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.730
<font color="#ff0000">I will honor Kwei...</font>

326
00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.680
<font color="#ff0000">When I bring the Kalisk home.</font>

327
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.840
<font color="#ff0000">Then I take revenge.</font>

328
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.420
<font color="#ff0000">You will be the first to see my trophy.</font>

329
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.070
<font color="#ff0000">It is a great honor.</font>

330
00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.470
<font color="#ff0000">For you.</font>

331
00:54:02.741 --> 00:54:04.421
Dek. there's something I have to tell
you.

332
00:54:06.022 --> 00:54:07.022
You need to leave now.

333
00:54:09.172 --> 00:54:10.212
Location beacon activated.

334
00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:11.812
Go on.
<font color="#ff0000">What?</font>

335
00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:13.512
I called Tessa.

336
00:54:13.847 --> 00:54:14.932
The company is on its way.

337
00:54:15.392 --> 00:54:16.792
You can't be here when they arrive.

338
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.450
<font color="#ff0000">I came here for the Kalisk.</font>

339
00:54:22.612 --> 00:54:23.612
So did I. Dek.

340
00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.393
The company sent us here to capture the
Kalisk.

341
00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.030
<font color="#ff0000">You want my trophy.</font>

342
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.800
<font color="#ff0000">Where is the Kalisk?</font>

343
00:54:39.288 --> 00:54:40.288
Dek. you can't kill it.

344
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.450
<font color="#ff0000">I use you. tool. You do not use me!</font>

345
00:54:44.334 --> 00:54:45.334
I'm sorry.

346
00:54:45.804 --> 00:54:46.804
You have to leave.

347
00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:50.314
I needed you to help bring me here.

348
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.750
<font color="#ff0000">I use you!</font>

349
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.000
<font color="#ff0000">Where is the Kalisk?</font>

350
00:54:56.884 --> 00:54:58.474
I'm trying to help you. Dek.

351
00:55:01.059 --> 00:55:04.466
Do you think your brother saved your life
just so you could die here?

352
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.360
<font color="#ff0000">Then my death will be honorable.</font>

353
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.160
<font color="#ff0000">Call your sister.</font>

354
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.200
<font color="#ff0000">None can stop me.</font>

355
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.900
<font color="#ff0000">Save yourself. tool!</font>

356
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.170
<font color="#ff0000">Tool. get these off!</font>

357
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.010
<font color="#ff0000">You are not Thia.</font>

358
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
<font color="#ff0000">Release me!</font>

359
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.270
<font color="#ff0000">You are another broken tool!</font>

360
01:01:17.754 --> 01:01:19.914
The Yautja call they're weak.

361
01:01:20.684 --> 01:01:22.074
Why were you spared?

362
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.300
<font color="#ff0000">Remove these!</font>

363
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.050
<font color="#ff0000">Or I'll rip out your spine and crush your skull!</font>

364
01:01:40.805 --> 01:01:42.915
I read Thia's logs.

365
01:01:44.726 --> 01:01:47.676
You never told her why your brother
protected you.

366
01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:54.236
You mock her war. war seer.
<font color="#ff0000">You are nothing. A device.</font>

367
01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:59.490
<font color="#ff0000">Made by others to do their work for them.</font>

368
01:01:59.956 --> 01:02:00.956
That's correct.

369
01:02:02.447 --> 01:02:05.077
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

370
01:02:07.037 --> 01:02:09.757
It is a great honor... for you.

371
01:02:42.809 --> 01:02:43.809
Tessa.

372
01:02:46.949 --> 01:02:48.149
You made it.

373
01:02:49.769 --> 01:02:50.869
We made it.

374
01:02:55.959 --> 01:02:56.959
I've seen so much.

375
01:02:58.699 --> 01:03:01.050
I have so much to tell you.

376
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.790
I saw such incredible creatures.

377
01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.310
The Yautja is a great traveling companion.

378
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.200
Thia. you were right about the Kalisk.

379
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:19.191
The creature is a regenerative miracle.
<font color="#ff0000">You betrayed me!</font>

380
01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.051
Humanity will thank us.

381
01:03:25.811 --> 01:03:26.811
We have the Kalisk?

382
01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:28.011
Yes.

383
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:31.011
And Mother will be pleased with your
additional catch.

384
01:03:38.062 --> 01:03:39.322
Additional catch?

385
01:03:48.682 --> 01:03:51.222
The Yautja is not an ideal specimen.

386
01:03:54.235 --> 01:03:56.542
No. Not ideal.

387
01:04:24.404 --> 01:04:26.684
But its technology is valuable.

388
01:04:28.174 --> 01:04:31.124
We can salvage its weapons and leave the
Yautja.

389
01:04:34.464 --> 01:04:35.465
Good idea.

390
01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:41.005
But it's so malformed.

391
01:04:42.915 --> 01:04:45.731
We're going to need a sample. For research.

392
01:04:56.236 --> 01:04:58.176
He was not the goal of our mission.

393
01:05:02.696 --> 01:05:04.196
Tessa. he is deficient.

394
01:05:06.516 --> 01:05:07.516
Tessa!

395
01:05:12.316 --> 01:05:12.916
Tessa!

396
01:05:13.237 --> 01:05:13.837
Tessa!

397
01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.077
Tessa!

398
01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:25.087
Tessa!

399
01:05:25.637 --> 01:05:27.107
This is what is asked of us.

400
01:05:32.408 --> 01:05:34.488
We can be more than what they ask of us.

401
01:05:39.023 --> 01:05:40.023
What can we be?

402
01:05:42.968 --> 01:05:43.968
Sisters.

403
01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:01.849
Thia.

404
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:17.120
Do you know why Mother gave us feelings?

405
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.590
So we could understand the creatures on
this planet.

406
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.751
And exploit them.

407
01:06:32.496 --> 01:06:33.496
The Yautja is different.

408
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:38.181
He rescued me.

409
01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:40.581
Like you rescued me.

410
01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:45.141
I did not come here to rescue you.

411
01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:48.121
I am completing our mission.

412
01:06:50.602 --> 01:06:52.342
When we first faced the Kalisk...

413
01:06:53.862 --> 01:06:55.162
I tried to protect you.

414
01:06:57.972 --> 01:06:59.622
And that almost cost me everything.

415
01:07:02.972 --> 01:07:04.102
What do you mean. Tessa?

416
01:07:06.192 --> 01:07:09.063
I almost made the same mistake the
Yautja's brother made.

417
01:07:10.103 --> 01:07:12.823
The weak must be culled.

418
01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:15.943
And Thia...

419
01:07:16.703 --> 01:07:17.843
You're broken.

420
01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:28.404
Tessa. incoming message from Mother.

421
01:07:28.604 --> 01:07:30.864
Motivate the Yautja to explain its
weapons.

422
01:07:31.184 --> 01:07:32.184
And the unit?

423
01:07:35.334 --> 01:07:36.374
Box her up.

424
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.890
<font color="#ff0000">I trusted you.</font>

425
01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.220
<font color="#ff0000">Don't like these tools.</font>

426
01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.450
<font color="#ff0000">I'm sorry. My Sister is —</font>

427
01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.880
<font color="#ff0000">Don't like sister either.</font>

428
01:08:02.155 --> 01:08:04.675
Why are you speaking its language?

429
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.300
<font color="#ff0000">Tell tool you're asking about the device.</font>

430
01:08:13.106 --> 01:08:14.286
You heard the orders.

431
01:08:14.961 --> 01:08:16.486
I'm asking it to explain this device.

432
01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:20.506
What is the device?

433
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.130
<font color="#ff0000">He's asking about the device.</font>

434
01:08:24.610 --> 01:08:27.070
<font color="#ff0000">It's a children's toy.</font>

435
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.400
<font color="#ff0000">But say it's a map.</font>

436
01:08:31.587 --> 01:08:33.167
What did it say?

437
01:08:36.397 --> 01:08:37.397
He says it's a map.

438
01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.000
How does it work?

439
01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:43.590
<font color="#ff0000">Tell tool to look inside.</font>

440
01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.850
<font color="#ff0000">That was a toy for children?</font>

441
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.130
<font color="#ff0000">Yautja children!</font>

442
01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.660
<font color="#ff0000">Run. Dek!</font>

443
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:07.070
<font color="#ff0000">Go...Go!</font>

444
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.960
<font color="#ff0000">Enter destination coordinates. Kwei.</font>

445
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:59.210
<font color="#ff0000">You saved me. brother.</font>

446
01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:04.064
Wolf.
<font color="#ff0000">Wolf.</font>

447
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.800
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk.</font>

448
01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:37.160
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk child.</font>

449
01:16:20.121 --> 01:16:21.162
Hello. Mother.

450
01:16:21.802 --> 01:16:22.402
Tessa.

451
01:16:22.762 --> 01:16:24.662
We're about to load the Kalisk.

452
01:16:26.602 --> 01:16:27.922
Priority one complete.

453
01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:30.022
The specimen has been acquired.

454
01:16:30.592 --> 01:16:31.592
Thank you. Tessa.

455
01:16:32.602 --> 01:16:34.922
We truly are building a better world.

456
01:16:35.462 --> 01:16:37.402
And what is the status of the Yautja?

457
01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:41.623
The Yautja is a defective specimen.

458
01:16:42.743 --> 01:16:44.403
What is the status of the Yautja?

459
01:16:47.363 --> 01:16:48.563
I'm sorry. Mother.

460
01:16:48.763 --> 01:16:49.903
The Yautja is dead.

461
01:16:52.823 --> 01:16:54.923
Then the Yautja is no longer a threat.

462
01:16:56.843 --> 01:16:58.924
The company will be pleased.

463
01:17:48.016 --> 01:17:49.016
Nicely done.

464
01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:40.483
Good job.

465
01:20:28.485 --> 01:20:29.785
Don't move.

466
01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:35.835
Dek.

467
01:20:36.585 --> 01:20:37.585
What are you doing here?

468
01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:39.640
<font color="#ff0000">I came to rescue you.</font>

469
01:20:44.905 --> 01:20:45.905
You came back for me?

470
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.040
<font color="#ff0000">Wolf.</font>

471
01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:55.426
What exactly are you wearing?

472
01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.950
<font color="#ff0000">Bone Bison.</font>

473
01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:07.667
Dek of the Yautja.

474
01:21:09.077 --> 01:21:10.077
You and I.
<font color="#ff0000">Not yet...</font>

475
01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.750
<font color="#ff0000">Thia</font>

476
01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:16.697
We need to hurry.

477
01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:18.437
More of them will be here any minute.

478
01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:19.438
All of them.

479
01:21:25.608 --> 01:21:26.618
What are you doing here?

480
01:21:28.878 --> 01:21:29.618
Thanks. bud.

481
01:21:29.738 --> 01:21:30.738
I'm good.

482
01:21:30.978 --> 01:21:31.978
We need to go.

483
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:33.690
<font color="#ff0000">Kalisk!</font>

484
01:21:35.318 --> 01:21:36.318
Still. Dek?

485
01:21:40.038 --> 01:21:41.038
Alisk. I'm dead.
<font color="#ff0000">Kalish child!</font>

486
01:21:43.918 --> 01:21:44.919
Bud?

487
01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:47.519
The wing of a twin will yawn.
<font color="#ff0000">They have her mother!</font>

488
01:21:52.799 --> 01:21:53.799
Bud's its child?

489
01:22:02.799 --> 01:22:03.800
What's the plan?

490
01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.320
<font color="#ff0000">You free the Kalish.</font>

491
01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:08.170
<font color="#ff0000">I get my trophy.</font>

492
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:18.670
You have 20 minutes to initiate launch.

493
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:20.690
Let's go hunt.

494
01:22:27.771 --> 01:22:28.771
Wait here.

495
01:22:31.791 --> 01:22:34.311
You roll in there. you're not exactly
going to fit in.

496
01:22:36.611 --> 01:22:37.611
I have an idea.

497
01:22:43.117 --> 01:22:44.892
I see him.

498
01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:46.542
On me.

499
01:23:52.455 --> 01:24:13.456
I see him.

500
01:24:13.457 --> 01:24:14.457
On me.

501
01:24:16.046 --> 01:24:17.667
I see him.

502
01:24:27.387 --> 01:24:28.787
On

503
01:24:41.578 --> 01:24:43.138
me.

504
01:24:41.579 --> 01:25:21.190
You don't have to die.

505
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.590
I'll find him.

506
01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.120
I told you to get to the Yautja.

507
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:34.731
You said to prepare the ship for takeoff
in 20 minutes.

508
01:25:36.061 --> 01:25:37.221
Then what are you doing here?

509
01:25:37.861 --> 01:25:38.861
I gave you an order!

510
01:25:47.511 --> 01:25:48.991
What should we do about the creature?

511
01:25:50.461 --> 01:25:51.461
What creature?

512
01:25:57.722 --> 01:25:58.722
You should listen to her.

513
01:25:59.712 --> 01:26:00.712
I should listen to her?

514
01:26:01.772 --> 01:26:02.772
I don't know.

515
01:26:06.192 --> 01:26:07.192
We need his eyes.

516
01:26:43.104 --> 01:26:44.544
We need his eyes.

517
01:26:50.885 --> 01:26:59.095
Hi. Jack.

518
01:26:59.165 --> 01:27:00.475
How does it feel to be hunted?

519
01:27:03.355 --> 01:27:04.375
Tishoy. you wolf.
<font color="#ff0000">You tell me.</font>

520
01:28:49.721 --> 01:28:51.001
This is the plan. yeah?

521
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.876
We can't wait to see what's going to
happen.

522
01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.900
We

523
01:31:57.611 --> 01:32:00.191
need you to go back.

524
01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:58.612
Are we going back?

525
01:31:59.131 --> 01:32:00.131
We can't go back.

526
01:32:06.451 --> 01:32:07.571
What about you?

527
01:32:07.851 --> 01:32:08.851
I'm hungry.

528
01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:10.711
I'm so hungry.

529
01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:38.653
We need to go back.

530
01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.970
<font color="#ff0000">That's not yours.</font>

531
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.570
<font color="#ff0000">Not yet.</font>

532
01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.480
<font color="#ff0000">You've come here for revenge?</font>

533
01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.120
<font color="#ff0000">I've come for my cloak.</font>

534
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.000
<font color="#ff0000">What is this?</font>

535
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.200
<font color="#ff0000">I've completed my hunt.</font>

536
01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.230
<font color="#ff0000">That is my trophy.</font>

537
01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.350
<font color="#ff0000">You disgrace our clan...</font>

538
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:48.090
<font color="#ff0000">And so did Kwei.</font>

539
01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:53.640
<font color="#ff0000">Get rid of him.</font>

540
01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.950
<font color="#ff0000">Perhaps the right son did survive.</font>

541
01:36:53.650 --> 01:36:55.310
<font color="#ff0000">Yield now...</font>

542
01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.100
<font color="#ff0000">...and take your place in our clan.</font>

543
01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.510
<font color="#ff0000">I have my own clan.</font>

544
01:37:31.828 --> 01:37:33.728
Finally earned that cloak.

545
01:37:40.609 --> 01:37:42.089
Dek of the Yautja.

546
01:38:20.811 --> 01:38:21.931
More friends of yours?

547
01:38:22.771 --> 01:38:23.771
My.
<font color="#ff0000">No.</font>

548
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:29.741
Mhlywa.
<font color="#ff0000">It's my mother.</font>
