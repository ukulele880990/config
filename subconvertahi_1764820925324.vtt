- Bravissima. I'm a big fan of
your voice.

You have an exceptional talent.

10
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.491
- Thank you (chuckles).

11
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.827
- Apologies. Where are my
manners?

12
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.696
What can I get you to drink?

13
00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.598
- Oh. I'm okay. thank you.

14
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:45.700
- Please. after a performance
like that.

15
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:49.403
you certainly earned one. for
sure.

16
00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.270
Yes?

17
00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.975
- Okay. I'll have a
glass of red wine please.

18
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.344
- Akheem. bring me one bottle
of this new French red wine

19
00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.746
we just received yesterday.

20
00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.647
- Yes. sir.

21
00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.519
- You're from Chicago. right?

22
00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:06.621
You must be fan of cold winters
then?

23
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:10.223
- Oh no. I hate the cold
actually.

24
00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:14.294
I'm from Florida. but I moved
away as soon as I could.

25
00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.663
To chase a dream.

26
00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.832
And cold winters just became a
price

27
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.232
for that dream. I guess.

28
00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:21.869
- It's paradise here.

29
00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:24.872
Rarely gets below 72 degrees.

30
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:30.812
I'm offering you three times
whatever you make in Chicago

31
00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.682
to sing here in my club.
exclusively for me.

32
00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:39.486
- My God. that's an amazing
offer.

33
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:42.690
(wine pouring)

34
00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:43.891
- I'm so sorry. ma'am. Let me
get that.

35
00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.325
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

36
00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.961
- It's not your fault.

37
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.530
- Akheem. it's okay. calm down.

38
00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:52.800
She's right. It certainly was an
accident.

39
00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.268
How long have you been
working for me. Akheem?

40
00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.739
- Almost two months. sir.

41
00:03:57.772 --> 00:04:00.440
- Then you know the customer is
king.

42
00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:04.512
The customer deserve
excellent service. always.

43
00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:06.379

I'm sorry. ma'am.

45
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.315
- It's okay.

46
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.183
- I'm so so sorry.

47
00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:11.786
(blood flowing)

48
00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.253
- You should be sorry.

49
00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:16.023
(blood flowing)

50
00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:18.760
(Akheem gasping)

51
00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:21.929
(soft dramatic music)

52
00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:32.439
Apologies.

53
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:37.410
Why you don't go to get
cleaned up a little bit?

54
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.114
Then come sing for me something
special.

55
00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:43.483
(soft dramatic music)

56
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.391
You work for me now.

57
00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.493
(Nora whimpering)

58
00:04:53.528 --> 00:04:57.397

(dramatic music)

62
00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.855
(soft dramatic music)

63
00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:36.737
- So. I finally had to
tell her last night.

64
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:37.972
Bon voyage. Coco.

65
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:42.176
You know. I know she was
wrong for me from the moment

66
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.712
we met. but was she beautiful.
man.

67
00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.881
She had them long legs she
would just wrap around me.

68
00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:50.818
Crystal blue eyes. like
swimming pools of beauty.

69
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:51.853
Just. mm (inhales).

70
00:05:54.222 --> 00:05:56.557
Hey. Mark. I'm over here just
pouring my heart out to you

71
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.825
and I feel like you're not even
listening.

72
00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:58.860
Are you listening?

73
00:05:58.893 --> 00:05:59.760
- No.

74
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.697
- Okay. all right. You're right.

75
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.365
You were right. because I know.
from the moment you met her

76
00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.433
you were all like ...

77
00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.202
- She wasn't right for you.

78
00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:09.904
- And why is that. exactly?

79
00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.241
- She was normal.

80
00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:13.941
- Well. yeah.

81
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.212
Well you know this is all
kinda your fault. right?

82
00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:18.880
- My fault?

83
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.816
- Well yeah.

84
00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.118
We been working together
for years now. man.

85
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:26.554
All you gotta do is come out
with me every once in a while.

86
00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:27.788
just have a couple drinks.
and maybe you could

87
00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.590
steer me clear of the wrong
girls.

88
00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:33.160
- I told you. I'm not into
that singles dating thing.

89
00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:35.462
- Singles dating scene. man.
that's all the dating scene is

90
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.697
is a bunch of singles.

91
00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:38.799
Come on. man. you're the
only guy I know who's got

92
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.902
his ex-wife's name tattooed on
his finger.

93
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.974
- She wasn't my ex-wife
when I got the tattoo.

94
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.744
- Yeah. I know that. Just
add a little something to it.

95
00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:52.046
What does that say anyway.
Attila?

96
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.047
- It's Akilah. Akilah.

97
00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:57.585
- Okay. so add a T and now it's
Tequila.

98
00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.053
Right? You'd be the cool guy at
the bar.

99
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.354
You got Tequila on your knuckle.

100
00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:01.055
- They're here.

101
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.490
Get serious.

102
00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:07.061
(soft suspenseful music)

103
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:12.033
- Rock. paper. scissors? Hm?

104
00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:17.004
Okay. You always do rock anyway.

105
00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:19.941
(soft suspenseful music)

106
00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:20.841

Oh. you too hard for that shit.

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.842
- My brother's gonna get
the money from your car.

122
00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:59.280
- Hey. hey. hey. Yo. Rambo.

123
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:02.783

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:51.932
- Same quality as before?

140
00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:52.833
- Even better.

141
00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.004
(plastic snapping)

142
00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:02.977

- Great.

144
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.847
Well. it's been a pleasure
doing business with you

145
00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:08.949
but don't take this the
wrong way when I say.

146
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:10.684
I'm not gonna lose any
sleep if I never have to see

147
00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.720
your ugly fucking face ever
again.

148
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:16.791
(Jose speaking Spanish)

149
00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:18.259
Well. that's not good.

150
00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:21.328
- Yo. Phil. We good?

151
00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:22.229
Talk to me.

152
00:09:22.263 --> 00:09:23.631
- Never better.

153
00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:26.467
Just think we got a little
lost in translation over here.

154
00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.804
- I'm gonna need you to pick up
that bag.

155
00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:33.808
Or I will end you right here.
right now.

156
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.210
- Wait. so this whole time
you could speak English?

157
00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:37.344
- Pick up that bag.

158
00:09:37.378 --> 00:09:38.045
- All right.

159
00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:40.247
- Slowly

160
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:43.918
- Listen. man. okay.
it was real rude of me.

161
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.020
and if I'm being honest with
myself.

162
00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:49.056
rather racist to assume
you don't speak English.

163
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.224
(gun firing rapidly)

164
00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:53.327
- Hey. LAPD. motherfucker.
Drop it. drop it.

165
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.228
Phil. talk to me.

166
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:57.164
(blows striking)

167
00:09:57.198 --> 00:09:59.633
(both groaning)

168
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.269
(dramatic music)

169
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:06.173
- He's a dead man. You both are.

170
00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:07.608
- Shut the fuck up.

171
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:08.709
Hey. Phil?

172
00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:12.179
(knee thudding)

173
00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:13.848
(both groaning)

174
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.552
- Wait. wait! You're under
arrest. LAPD!

175
00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:18.853
(Phil groaning)

176
00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:19.920
- Phil!

177
00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.556
- You might as well shoot.
because I promise you.

178
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.358
my family will come after you
and everyone who loves you.

179
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.392
- Phil?

180
00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:26.627
- Till all of your lifeless
bodies

181
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.895
are hanging from an overpass.

182
00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.297
- Hey. hey. Shut the fuck
up was not a request.

183
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:32.800
Shut up. Phil!

184
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:34.235
- You have the right to remain
silent.

185
00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:36.070
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

186
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.304
(blows striking)

187
00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:38.839
(both groaning)

188
00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.009
(kick striking)

189
00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:43.344
- You okay?

190
00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:45.713
(blows striking)

191
00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:46.981
(dramatic music)

192
00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:49.316
- If you can't afford an
attorney

193
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.285
one will be appointed for you.

194
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:53.854
(kick striking)

195
00:10:53.888 --> 00:10:56.490
Have you understood these rights
as I have read them to you?

196
00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:59.960
Hey. amigo. Buddy?

197
00:10:59.994 --> 00:11:01.028
Ah. shit.

198
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:03.864
Hey. Mark. do you think
he heard that last part

199
00:11:03.898 --> 00:11:06.100
or am I gonna have to read
him his whole Miranda rights

200
00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:09.538
warning all over again.
because I don't wanna.

201
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:10.771
- Well. judging by his rap
sheet.

202
00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.373
I think he's heard it before.

203
00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:14.942
- You. uh. look clean.

204
00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:17.111
Your guy. he was a lot smaller.

205
00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:20.881
- True. Maybe you should cuff
him.

206
00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:22.216
I don't know if you
have the punching power

207
00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:24.118
to keep him out very long.

208
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:26.287
- Oh. he's got jokes.
and white pants. Heh.

209
00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:29.857
- Hey. it is not a good time.

210
00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:33.994
(soft mournful music)

211
00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.969
- We are gathered here today

212
00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:17.171
to celebrate the life
of our brother Akheem.

213
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.476
I have known Akheem's mother.
Yvonne.

214
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.211
and his brother Mark for a long
time.

215
00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:28.949
I can remember the day Akheem
was born.

216
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.088
bringing with him into this
world. and to this island.

217
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.290
that infectious smile that all
of us

218
00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:38.292
would soon know and love.

219
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:43.330
I ask all of you now to
remember fondly Akheem

220
00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.032
and his infectious smile.

221
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.237
But also to let his
tragic death be a reminder

222
00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:53.340
that we must collectively
guard the lives of our youths.

223
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:57.077
Because make no mistake about
it.

224
00:12:58.747 --> 00:13:02.182
whereas our island is
surely a gift from God.

225
00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:05.953
lest we forget the devil does
not strike at us from afar.

226
00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:11.492
No. He slithers along
the soil we call home.

227
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.428
Waiting to coil around the feet

228
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.463
of any who dare oppose him.

229
00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:20.034
(soft mournful music)

230
00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:37.985
Yvonne. I am so sorry.

231
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.389
- Thank you. Akilah.

232
00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:45.593
(soft piano music)

233
00:13:45.627 --> 00:13:48.996
- Please. come see me soon.

234
00:13:50.632 --> 00:13:53.367
(Yvonne crying)

235
00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:58.238
- We never met. I'm Manuel
Alvarez.

236
00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:02.443
I'm terribly sorry. My deepest
condolence.

237
00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:06.180
(soft piano music)

238
00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:09.149
If there is anything I can do
for you. please let me know.

239
00:14:13.722 --> 00:14:15.889
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

240
00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:19.059
(soft mournful music)

241
00:14:31.472 --> 00:14:33.407
(door closing)

242
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.377
(soft mournful music)

243
00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:41.516
- I'm sorry. Son. I didn't get
a chance to clean the house.

244
00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:42.751
- Mom. it's fine. it's fine.

245
00:14:42.784 --> 00:14:43.852
- But I'm glad you're home.
baby.

246
00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.219
- Me too.

247
00:14:45.252 --> 00:14:47.488
- Let me get you something
to eat. You must be hungry.

248
00:14:47.522 --> 00:14:49.858
- No. Mom. Mom. Mom. please.
please stop.

249
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.258
I just want you to relax.

250
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:54.361
You don't need to be doing
anything right now. Come. sit.

251
00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:55.229
Come. sit.

252
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.233
- I have some things from your
brother.

253
00:14:59.266 --> 00:14:59.933
- Okay.

254
00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.302
(soft music)

255
00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:25.693
- He was wearing that when ...

256
00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:29.329
I'd like you to have it.

257
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:31.498
(soft music)

258
00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:36.470
- Thanks. Mom.

259
00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:39.006
(soft music)

260
00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:43.545
Tell me what happened.

261
00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:46.246
- I don't. I don't know.

262
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.684
He got a job. and he was
staying out of trouble.

263
00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:51.418
- Trouble?

264
00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:54.522
- A lot has changed over
the past seven years

265
00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:55.989
since you've been gone. Son.

266
00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:59.193
The island just isn't the same
anymore.

267
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.394
- I'm gonna find out what
happened.

268
00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:04.599
- No. no. Mark. I just
lost one of my sons.

269
00:16:04.632 --> 00:16:06.534
I cannot lose another.

270
00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:09.102
- Mom. listen to me. okay?

271
00:16:10.872 --> 00:16:14.609
Everything is gonna be
okay. Just trust me.

272
00:16:14.642 --> 00:16:16.009
Get some rest. okay?

273
00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:19.614
(Yvonne sobbing)

274
00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:22.584
(soft music)

275
00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:24.351
It's gonna be okay.

276
00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:27.254
(Yvonne crying)

277
00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:29.791
Hey. Mom. it's gonna be all
right.

278
00:16:29.824 --> 00:16:32.794
(Yvonne crying)

279
00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:34.428
Get some rest.

280
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.664
- Okay (cries).

281
00:16:36.698 --> 00:16:39.233
(soft music)

282
00:17:29.182 --> 00:17:31.786
(dramatic music)

283
00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:54.642
(gate squeaking)

284
00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:57.210
(soft music)

285
00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:01.181
- I swear to God. it's not our
stuff.

286
00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:02.482
I'm telling you. tell him.

287
00:18:02.517 --> 00:18:04.318
- Yo. somebody put that
in our car. I promise you.

288
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:05.853
- We've been set up. We were set
up.

289
00:18:05.887 --> 00:18:07.421
A complete misunderstanding.

290
00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:09.624
It's a big misunderstanding.
okay?

291
00:18:09.657 --> 00:18:10.625
It's the truth. I swear.

292
00:18:12.594 --> 00:18:14.662
(knocking on door)

293
00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:16.631
(Nate chuckling)

294
00:18:16.664 --> 00:18:17.865
- Yes. Brother.

295
00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:21.101
- Long time.

296
00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:22.537
- Yeah. Sit down. sit down.

297
00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:29.677
I'm really sorry about Akheem.

298
00:18:31.646 --> 00:18:33.113
He was a good kid.

299
00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:34.214
- Thank you.

300
00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:37.150
So what have you found out?

301
00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:45.125
- We go way back. so I'm just
gonna give it to you straight.

302
00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:48.161
We don't have the same
manpower that you do in LA.

303
00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:49.597
- I remember.

304
00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:50.497
- So this.

305
00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:54.502
this is gonna take some time.

306
00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:59.473
And right now. we don't have
a whole lot to go off of.

307
00:19:06.748 --> 00:19:08.783
- This is all you have?

308
00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:12.285
- That's everything from the
table.

309
00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.822
Maybe a fight with the gangs.

310
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:15.723
- Gangs?

311
00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:20.460
- Yeah. there's been a lotta
crime

312
00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:22.496
here on the island since you
been gone.

313
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.632
Especially with gangs
from neighboring islands

314
00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:25.499
coming here to party.

315
00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:27.669
The drug traffic is way up.

316
00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:31.773
- So you think this is
gang-related?

317
00:19:34.742 --> 00:19:35.610
- Like I say.

318
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:39.312
this is gonna take some time to
find out

319
00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:41.649
what actually happened.

320
00:19:41.683 --> 00:19:45.352
But when I do. you'll
be the first to know.

321
00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:47.822
- All right.

322
00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:50.958
(soft dramatic music)

323
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:55.963
(hands smacking)

324
00:19:55.997 --> 00:19:59.332
(soft dramatic music)

325
00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:08.142
(students shouting)

326
00:20:08.176 --> 00:20:09.010
- Nine.

327
00:20:09.043 --> 00:20:09.744
(students shouting)

328
00:20:09.777 --> 00:20:10.645
10!

329
00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:11.813

330
00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:12.479
(students shouting)

331
00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:13.380
Two!

332
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:14.849
Three!

333
00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.249

(students shouting)

334
00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:17.384
- Five!
(students shouting)

335
00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:18.786
- Six!
(students shouting)

336
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.487
- Seven!
(students shouting)

337
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.622
- Eight!
(students shouting)

338
00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:23.223

(students shouting)

339
00:20:23.591 --> 00:20:24.324
10!

340
00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:25.492
(students shouting)

341
00:20:27.695 --> 00:20:28.328
And one!

342
00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:29.030
(students shouting)

343
00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:29.897
Two!

344
00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:31.032
- Three!
(students shouting)

345
00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:32.633
- Four!
(students shouting)

346
00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:34.468
- Bye. Sensei Akilah.

347
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:36.436
- Bye. Sensei.

348
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.672
- See you guys next week.

349
00:20:41.743 --> 00:20:43.978
So. how's the big city treating
you?

350
00:20:44.812 --> 00:20:47.548
- Well. not a day goes
by that I don't think

351
00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:51.652
about the island. if
that's what you're asking.

352
00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:53.855
- But you left.

353
00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:55.890
- And you know why I left?

354
00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:58.693
- Yeah.

355
00:21:00.862 --> 00:21:02.797
So. um ...

356
00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:06.634
Did you ever remarry?

357
00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:09.604
(soft music)

358
00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:12.907
- No.

359
00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:15.910
You?

360
00:21:18.613 --> 00:21:19.479
- No.

361
00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:23.618
(soft piano music)

362
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.587
- Well I'm happy you kept
up with your training.

363
00:21:27.722 --> 00:21:30.057
How long have you had the dojo?

364
00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:32.126
- Ah. going on about three years
now.

365
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.027
- Uh-huh.

366
00:21:35.763 --> 00:21:36.731
I'm impressed.

367
00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:40.134
The kids are lucky to have you.

368
00:21:40.168 --> 00:21:42.369
(soft piano music)

369
00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:44.906
- You know. I um.

370
00:21:46.741 --> 00:21:48.943
I always hoped I'd see you
again.

371
00:21:51.212 --> 00:21:52.613
but not like this.

372
00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:56.717
I am so sorry about Akheem.
Mark.

373
00:21:58.953 --> 00:21:59.854
- Thank you.

374
00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:02.924
- How long are you staying for?

375
00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:06.794
- Long enough to find out
what happened to Akheem.

376
00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:10.198
I went to the police
station to talk to Nate.

377
00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:14.035
He says there are gangs
here on the island.

378
00:22:14.068 --> 00:22:15.903
- Unfortunately. yeah.

379
00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:18.471
The gangs come over on the
weekends from other islands

380
00:22:18.506 --> 00:22:20.775
and bring with them more drugs
and crime.

381
00:22:20.808 --> 00:22:23.611
But I wouldn't hold on to too
much hope

382
00:22:23.644 --> 00:22:25.947
in whatever Nate says or does.

383
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.914
- Why is that?

384
00:22:28.683 --> 00:22:31.652
- Because people around here
are afraid to make waves.

385
00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:33.521
- I'm listening.

386
00:22:35.056 --> 00:22:38.759
- This guy. Manuel
Alvarez. everyone calls him

387
00:22:38.793 --> 00:22:40.528
the Company because he owns
everything

388
00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:42.663
that's important on the island.

389
00:22:42.697 --> 00:22:46.868
He owns the bank. construction
companies. hotels.

390
00:22:47.902 --> 00:22:51.505
In less than four years. he
basically managed to control

391
00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:54.008
the entire economy of the
island.

392
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.711
Not to mention the only
places that the gangs seem

393
00:22:56.744 --> 00:22:59.747
to avoid are the businesses he
owns.

394
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.215
And I'm pretty sure he controls
them too.

395
00:23:01.249 --> 00:23:04.585
just to scare the people on the
island.

396
00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:06.888
So whether they like it
or not. a lot of people

397
00:23:06.921 --> 00:23:09.489
around here rely on him to
survive.

398
00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:12.492
Do you remember Vanessa?

399
00:23:13.828 --> 00:23:14.962
- Yeah.

400
00:23:14.996 --> 00:23:17.098
- She's working at the bank
and told me in confidence

401
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:19.901
that hundreds of millions
go through the bank now.

402
00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:23.838
- But what does that
have to do with Akheem?

403
00:23:25.873 --> 00:23:28.843
- Two months ago. Akheem took a
job

404
00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:31.979
as a bartender working for
Alvarez.

405
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.948
- What club?

406
00:23:34.949 --> 00:23:36.884
- Luna. Club Luna.

407
00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:41.756
What are you going to do. Mark?

408
00:23:43.324 --> 00:23:45.026
- I'm gonna do whatever it
takes.

409
00:23:46.794 --> 00:23:49.964
Starting with a visit to this
Alvarez.

410
00:23:51.966 --> 00:23:52.934
- Just be careful.

411
00:23:54.035 --> 00:23:56.003
(dramatic music)

412
00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:08.549
(engine humming)

413
00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:11.919
(soft dramatic music)

414
00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:28.235
- Can I help you?

415
00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:30.338
- Here to speak to your boss.

416
00:24:30.371 --> 00:24:32.573
- You're gonna have to
make an appointment.

417
00:24:32.606 --> 00:24:34.008
- Not my style.

418
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:36.911
- Your style? Perhaps you've not
heard--

419
00:24:36.944 --> 00:24:37.812
- It's okay.

420
00:24:39.747 --> 00:24:40.581
Please.

421
00:24:41.649 --> 00:24:42.750
Come. sit down.

422
00:24:44.218 --> 00:24:44.885
- No thank you.

423
00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:49.190
- Can I get you something to
drink?

424
00:24:49.223 --> 00:24:49.890
- No.

425
00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:53.961
- So. how can I help you?

426
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.698
- My brother worked for you?

427
00:24:57.732 --> 00:25:00.634
- He did. A lot of people work
for me.

428
00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:02.903
- Mm. Here at this bar?

429
00:25:02.937 --> 00:25:05.973
- Yes. And he was a good
bartender.

430
00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:07.508
- So you're aware that
my brother was killed

431
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:09.310
the night he was working here?

432
00:25:09.343 --> 00:25:11.846
- You know. I don't think I like

433
00:25:11.879 --> 00:25:13.848
the implication you are making.

434
00:25:14.749 --> 00:25:16.784
- I look like I care what you
think?

435
00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:19.920
What the fuck happened to my
brother?

436
00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:25.726
- You are upset. and I get it.

437
00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:28.295
And I'm here to help.

438
00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:30.398
but you're not going to find the
answer

439
00:25:30.431 --> 00:25:32.133
you're looking for here.

440
00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:35.970
Your brother left after
his shift at night.

441
00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:38.406
and it seems to me he
may have gotten himself

442
00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:40.708
into some troubles with the
gangs.

443
00:25:40.741 --> 00:25:44.912
(soft dramatic music)

444
00:25:44.945 --> 00:25:48.249
(pen scribbling)

445
00:25:48.282 --> 00:25:48.949
Here.

446
00:25:51.318 --> 00:25:52.019
- What is this?

447
00:25:53.621 --> 00:25:56.023
- A spot. a bar actually.

448
00:25:56.057 --> 00:25:57.825
where a lot of the gangs

449
00:25:57.858 --> 00:26:00.127
that come over from
other islands hang out.

450
00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:02.531
My people have told me that your
brother

451
00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:04.665
used to go there after work.

452
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:09.804
This is not the same island
you grew up on. Not anymore.

453
00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:12.907
- You know. everybody
keeps telling me that.

454
00:26:14.008 --> 00:26:18.012
- Change is inevitable.
Good and bad. I'm afraid.

455
00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:21.015
- You're right about
that. Changes are coming.

456
00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:25.920
So you might wanna move your
business off of the island.

457
00:26:25.953 --> 00:26:26.620
- Oh (chuckles).

458
00:26:28.355 --> 00:26:31.092
A threat by an LA police
officer?

459
00:26:32.026 --> 00:26:36.130
Yes. I have friends all over
America.

460
00:26:37.264 --> 00:26:39.834
I did my homework on you. Mark.

461
00:26:41.102 --> 00:26:42.870
- Apparently not enough.

462
00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:44.872
Otherwise. you'd be packing
right now.

463
00:26:45.906 --> 00:26:49.276
I've done my homework
on you too. Mr. Alvarez.

464
00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:53.781
And I know your type. And I
promise you.

465
00:26:54.882 --> 00:26:56.585
The weather's about to
get very bad for you here.

466
00:26:56.617 --> 00:26:59.954
(soft dramatic music)

467
00:27:06.994 --> 00:27:08.195
(ice rattling)

468
00:27:08.229 --> 00:27:09.763
- What do you want me to do?

469
00:27:13.467 --> 00:27:15.102
(Manuel sighing)

470
00:27:16.303 --> 00:27:20.107
- Get the gangs from
the north to handle him.

471
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:23.077
(soft dramatic music)

472
00:27:26.447 --> 00:27:29.016
(engine humming)

473
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:34.989
(food sizzling)

474
00:27:42.229 --> 00:27:43.097
- Teseam?

475
00:27:44.265 --> 00:27:47.067
- Mark. My brother.

476
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:48.769
Welcome home and good to see
you.

477
00:27:48.802 --> 00:27:50.137
You hungry? Hey. let me hook you
up. man.

478
00:27:50.171 --> 00:27:51.105
- Nah nah. nah nah.

479
00:27:51.138 --> 00:27:54.942
No thanks. man. I'm
here for something else.

480
00:27:56.645 --> 00:27:58.913
- Man. I'm sorry about Akheem.

481
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.881
I really wanted to go to the
funeral.

482
00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:03.317
but with six mouths to
feed now. I got to--

483
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.953
- Wait. You and Dayana
got four more kids now?

484
00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:08.022
- Yeah. brother. we've been
blessed.

485
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.792
But things have been tough.

486
00:28:11.825 --> 00:28:13.160
at least for those of us who
still choose

487
00:28:13.194 --> 00:28:15.396
to do things the right way. you
know?

488
00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:18.232
- Yeah.

489
00:28:20.034 --> 00:28:22.937
You remember that package
I asked you to hold for me?

490
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.373
- Of course. I buried
it where you told me to.

491
00:28:26.407 --> 00:28:28.342
- Good. I'm gonna need it.

492
00:28:30.311 --> 00:28:31.278
- Shit is coming.

493
00:28:31.312 --> 00:28:33.347
- Shit is coming big time.
brother.

494
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.282

- If you're not a cop. you're
in the wrong fucking place.

517
00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:00.434
- I'm not here as a cop.

518
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.505
I'm here as a brother of the
island

519
00:30:03.538 --> 00:30:05.005
who has lost his brother.

520
00:30:05.372 --> 00:30:08.242
And all I want is a little
information

521
00:30:08.275 --> 00:30:10.377
about what happened to my
brother.

522
00:30:10.411 --> 00:30:13.414
- Motherfucker. you do see
I got a loaded gun. right?

523
00:30:13.447 --> 00:30:16.618
- Look. I realize you guys
are not from the island.

524
00:30:16.651 --> 00:30:19.453
so you don't know me or my
reputation.

525
00:30:19.486 --> 00:30:20.522
- Shoot this motherfucker. man.

526
00:30:20.555 --> 00:30:22.222
- All I want is ...

527
00:30:25.359 --> 00:30:26.493
some information.

528
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.068
Like I said. I'm not here to
hurt anyone.

529
00:30:34.101 --> 00:30:34.536
Okay?

530
00:30:38.205 --> 00:30:42.510
All I wanna know is if my
brother Akheem was here

531
00:30:42.544 --> 00:30:44.478
on the night that he was
murdered.

532
00:30:44.512 --> 00:30:45.580

(blows striking)

538
00:31:01.428 --> 00:31:04.131
(both groaning)

539
00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:07.468
(attacker screaming)

540
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.138
(Mark groaning)

541
00:31:12.005 --> 00:31:13.941
(blows striking)

542
00:31:13.974 --> 00:31:15.976
(attacker groaning)

543
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.147
(bones cracking)

544
00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:30.391
(blows striking)

545
00:31:30.424 --> 00:31:32.560
(head banging)

546
00:31:32.594 --> 00:31:35.597
(attacker groaning)

547
00:31:36.531 --> 00:31:38.499
(body crashing)

548
00:31:42.035 --> 00:31:45.507
- You broke my fucking nose
(spits).

549
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.408
- You wanna tell me about my
brother now?

550
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:48.676
- Fuck your brother.

551
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.344
(blows striking)

552
00:31:50.377 --> 00:31:51.945
(attacker groaning)

553
00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:53.615
(kicks striking)

554
00:31:59.521 --> 00:32:01.221
(body thudding)

555
00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:07.461
- That's right. Had it. didn't
need it.

556
00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:11.131
I could use it now if you like.

557
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.904
- I don't know him. I never met
him.

558
00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:17.639
We were just told to fuck some
dude up

559
00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:18.606
looking for his brother.

560
00:32:19.674 --> 00:32:21.609
That's all I know. I swear.

561
00:32:21.643 --> 00:32:24.344
- I believe you. Thank you.

562
00:32:24.378 --> 00:32:26.380
(kick striking)

563
00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:28.348
(engine roaring)

564
00:32:29.584 --> 00:32:30.384
- Yo. that's him!

565
00:32:30.417 --> 00:32:33.020
(guns firing)

566
00:32:35.289 --> 00:32:36.056
- He's here!

567
00:32:36.089 --> 00:32:38.492
(guns firing)

568
00:32:43.565 --> 00:32:44.632
- Let's go!

569
00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:47.635
(engines roaring)

570
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:49.704
(dramatic music)

571
00:32:53.575 --> 00:32:55.075
(engines revving)

572
00:32:55.108 --> 00:32:57.612
(brake squealing)

573
00:32:57.645 --> 00:33:01.148
(intense dramatic music)

574
00:33:02.416 --> 00:33:03.450
That way!

575
00:33:03.484 --> 00:33:05.385
(engines roaring)

576
00:33:10.525 --> 00:33:13.393
(guns firing)

577
00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:16.497
(engines revving)

578
00:33:16.531 --> 00:33:19.667
(intense dramatic music)

579
00:33:27.775 --> 00:33:28.510
- Shoot him.

580
00:33:28.543 --> 00:33:30.010
(guns firing)

581
00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:33.113
(intense dramatic music)

582
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.659
(soft suspenseful music)

583
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.664
- Yo. you guys see him anywhere?

584
00:33:49.697 --> 00:33:51.298
Shit. we lost him.

585
00:33:52.834 --> 00:33:53.668
Let's go.

586
00:33:53.701 --> 00:33:55.770
(engines roaring)

587
00:33:56.671 --> 00:33:58.606
(soft suspenseful music)

588
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:09.316
Fuck. I'll call him.

589
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.153
We lost him.

590
00:34:13.186 --> 00:34:15.455
- [Manuel] That's very
disappointing.

591
00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:17.725
I will deal with your failures
later.

592
00:34:17.759 --> 00:34:21.729
Go to the mother's house.
Use her to flush him out.

593
00:34:21.763 --> 00:34:22.830
- Understood.

594
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:25.098
(phone beeping)

595
00:34:25.132 --> 00:34:27.167
(engines roaring)

596
00:34:53.695 --> 00:34:55.763
(door opening)

597
00:34:56.564 --> 00:34:58.733
(soft suspenseful music)

598
00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:22.624
- Going dark.

599
00:35:22.657 --> 00:35:25.359
(dramatic music)

600
00:35:58.325 --> 00:36:01.261
(guns firing rapidly)

601
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:08.301
Fuck!

602
00:36:08.335 --> 00:36:10.772
(suspenseful music)

603
00:36:40.635 --> 00:36:41.969
- Here you go.

604
00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:43.336
- Thank you.

605
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.438
- Don't mention it.

606
00:36:47.775 --> 00:36:51.344
Yvonne. everything is going to
be okay.

607
00:36:52.013 --> 00:36:54.414
He's going to be okay.

608
00:36:54.448 --> 00:36:58.285
- You know. when you're a
mother. you always have to
worry.

609
00:36:58.318 --> 00:37:01.288
(soft piano music)

610
00:37:02.523 --> 00:37:05.793
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

611
00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:06.894
I'm so sorry.

612
00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:07.895
- It's okay.

613
00:37:09.864 --> 00:37:12.533
You know I really wish
that I could tell you

614
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:14.936
that after losing a child it
gets easier.

615
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.573
But even after seven years.

616
00:37:20.608 --> 00:37:21.509
it doesn't.

617
00:37:25.312 --> 00:37:27.815
(door opening)

618
00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:30.084
(soft piano music)

619
00:37:30.118 --> 00:37:31.853
- You two good?

620
00:37:31.886 --> 00:37:33.020
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

621
00:37:34.555 --> 00:37:36.057
- You have a first-aid kit?

622
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.992
- Yeah. I'll go grab it.

623
00:37:38.025 --> 00:37:39.093
- All right.

624
00:37:39.127 --> 00:37:42.730
(police radio chattering)

625
00:37:45.533 --> 00:37:47.467
- All right. so what we got?

626
00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:50.571
- We have a DOA. The rest
have gone on to the hospital.

627
00:37:52.573 --> 00:37:55.710
- Jesus Christ. These boys got
hit hard.

628
00:37:57.145 --> 00:37:58.079
Who else see it?

629
00:37:58.112 --> 00:37:58.880
- No one's talking.

630
00:38:00.081 --> 00:38:02.449
(Nate sighing)

631
00:38:02.482 --> 00:38:03.785
- All right. I'll take it from
here.

632
00:38:03.818 --> 00:38:05.352
Just make sure you secure the
perimeter.

633
00:38:05.385 --> 00:38:06.453
- Yes. sir.

634
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:08.756
- Excuse me. sir.

635
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.824
- Yes. Officer.

636
00:38:09.857 --> 00:38:11.324
- The station has been
trying to get hold of you.

637
00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:12.492
- What is it?

638
00:38:12.527 --> 00:38:13.561
- They say there's a possible
crime scene

639
00:38:13.594 --> 00:38:15.395
that you'd want to know about.

640
00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:18.099
- I have a crime scene here
already.

641
00:38:18.132 --> 00:38:20.802
- It's at Akheem's mother's
house.

642
00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:22.870
(soft dramatic music)

643
00:38:23.538 --> 00:38:24.939
- Tell them I'm on my way.

644
00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:26.107
- Okay. sir.

645
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.042
(soft dramatic music)

646
00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:36.851
(knocking on door)

647
00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:44.692
- Good thing nobody was home.

648
00:38:44.725 --> 00:38:45.726
- This time.

649
00:38:48.896 --> 00:38:50.665
- Any idea what happened
to a buncha gang members

650
00:38:50.698 --> 00:38:52.800
earlier tonight at the beach
bar?

651
00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:54.535
Hm?

652
00:38:54.902 --> 00:38:56.771
- Any idea what happened
to my brother or who tried

653
00:38:56.804 --> 00:38:58.906
to break into my mother's
house and kill her?

654
00:38:59.807 --> 00:39:03.811
- You have no idea what you
are asking of me right now.

655
00:39:05.478 --> 00:39:08.616
This? This is so much
bigger than your brother.

656
00:39:09.617 --> 00:39:12.753
- You're right. It's not gonna
stop.

657
00:39:12.787 --> 00:39:14.956
Not unless you help me to make
it stop.

658
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:17.592
- I think you already know the
answers

659
00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:19.459
to the questions you're asking.

660
00:39:19.492 --> 00:39:22.462
- This is our island. our home.

661
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:27.602
My father build this
house with his bare hands

662
00:39:27.635 --> 00:39:29.537
just like your father built
yours.

663
00:39:30.571 --> 00:39:33.040
They wanted my mother to be
there. Nate.

664
00:39:34.175 --> 00:39:35.509
Changes are coming.

665
00:39:36.978 --> 00:39:39.513
And you need to decide
what side of those changes

666
00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:41.148
you're gonna be standing on.

667
00:39:41.182 --> 00:39:44.518
(soft dramatic music)

668
00:39:52.894 --> 00:39:54.795
- Speak to the Luna's new
singer.

669
00:39:55.863 --> 00:39:57.665
One of my informants
told me she was working

670
00:39:57.698 --> 00:39:59.734
the night your brother was
killed.

671
00:40:00.801 --> 00:40:01.903
Her name's Nora.

672
00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:04.739
She's staying at the motel
by the church. Room 18.

673
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.675
(soft dramatic music)

674
00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:09.510
Is your mother somewhere safe?

675
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:10.878
- Yeah.

676
00:40:13.014 --> 00:40:14.481
At Akilah's place.

677
00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:16.517
- Good.

678
00:40:18.753 --> 00:40:20.487
- I need to trust you. Nate.

679
00:40:21.756 --> 00:40:25.026
This island needs help.
and I can't do it alone.

680
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:28.696
(soft dramatic music)

681
00:40:48.983 --> 00:40:51.919
(lighter clicking)

682
00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:57.858
- I don't think the word
disappointed carries enough
weight

683
00:40:57.892 --> 00:40:59.727
for what I'm feeling right now.

684
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.196
- We did what you asked. Boss.
after we lost him in town.

685
00:41:02.229 --> 00:41:06.267
but the house. it's empty.

686
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.569
They must have known someone was
coming.

687
00:41:08.602 --> 00:41:11.238
- So. this was my fault?

688
00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:13.808
- No. no. that's not what I
meant. no.

689
00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:16.777
- Sh. It's okay. forget about
it.

690
00:41:18.145 --> 00:41:19.513
You tried. right?

691
00:41:19.547 --> 00:41:21.649
You did the best you could
with the information you had.

692
00:41:21.682 --> 00:41:23.918
but they knew you were coming.

693
00:41:24.952 --> 00:41:25.820
Right?

694
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.055
- Y-yes. sir. Y-yes. sir.

695
00:41:30.424 --> 00:41:32.393
- Hey. hey. take it easy.

696
00:41:33.194 --> 00:41:36.230
Take a deep breath before
you're hyperventilating.

697
00:41:36.263 --> 00:41:37.965
(dramatic music)

698
00:41:37.999 --> 00:41:41.002
(assailant gasping)

699
00:41:47.641 --> 00:41:50.177
One thing I can't stand is
excuses.

700
00:41:51.312 --> 00:41:52.980
And a lack of accountability.

701
00:41:53.681 --> 00:41:56.884
(assailant gasping)

702
00:41:58.152 --> 00:41:59.020
- Please.

703
00:42:01.222 --> 00:42:02.223
Please. please!

704
00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.227
- So.

705
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.294
Fuck.

706
00:42:07.328 --> 00:42:10.031
- let's get back
to the accountability.

707
00:42:11.899 --> 00:42:13.501
Please. no no no!
Wait wait wait. wait!

708
00:42:13.534 --> 00:42:15.770
I have a photo. in my pocket.

709
00:42:15.803 --> 00:42:19.106
(assailant breathing hard)

710
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.076
(soft dramatic music)

711
00:42:25.713 --> 00:42:27.014
I think I know how to get this
guy.

712
00:42:27.048 --> 00:42:29.917
She. she's a local. Runs the
island dojo.

713
00:42:31.252 --> 00:42:33.354
(gun firing)

714
00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:35.689
(body splashing)

715
00:42:35.723 --> 00:42:39.026
(soft dramatic music)

716
00:42:43.597 --> 00:42:44.632
- Are you gonna come back inside

717
00:42:44.665 --> 00:42:46.033
and finish fucking me or what?

718
00:42:47.635 --> 00:42:48.936
- I'll be back in a moment.

719
00:42:50.505 --> 00:42:53.542
- This cop? More trouble than we

00:44:10.184 --> 00:44:13.120
(soft dramatic music)

735
00:44:15.389 --> 00:44:17.758

(soft dramatic music)

737

island.

739

Because he spilled some wine on
me.

757

Don't worry. You can trust him.

772

one of the good guys.

So how we looking?

777

- We're good.

778
00:47:32.654 --> 00:47:35.122
- Are you sure it isn't better
for her to stick around?

779
00:47:35.155 --> 00:47:37.559
We could arrest him now. and
with her testimony we could--

780
00:47:37.592 --> 00:47:40.361
- There isn't gonna be any
trial.

781
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.232
And I promised to get her off
the island.

782
00:47:47.401 --> 00:47:48.268
- We better get going.

783
00:47:48.969 --> 00:47:50.170
- Thank you.

784
00:47:50.204 --> 00:47:52.172
- No need to thank me
for doing what's right.

785
00:47:55.042 --> 00:47:56.578
You can come with me.

786
00:47:56.611 --> 00:47:57.978

There was an eyewitness.

of.

00:49:11.786 --> 00:49:13.120
This boat will take you to a
taxi

796
00:49:13.153 --> 00:49:15.289

Leave the demons you're
carrying. the ones in your head.

behind on this island.

805
00:49:43.518 --> 00:49:45.687
There's no reason for you
to carry them anymore.

(soft piano music)

807

I thought you were keeping her
locked up.

878
00:55:50.251 --> 00:55:51.986
Kind of hard for her to stay
strung out

879
00:55:53.921 --> 00:55:55.488
if she's out of junk!

880
00:55:55.523 --> 00:55:57.024

I dropped off some dope.

I gave it to her. I swear.

888
00:56:16.844 --> 00:56:19.013
- Did she use it. in front of
you?

889
00:56:20.181 --> 00:56:21.549
- I. I don't remember.

890
00:56:21.582 --> 00:56:23.851
- Oh. you don't remember?

891
00:56:25.019 --> 00:56:26.020
Don't remember.

892
00:56:28.122 --> 00:56:29.790
Do you have any on you now?

893
00:56:30.858 --> 00:56:31.993

894
00:56:32.026 --> 00:56:34.629

Do you have some on you now?

895
00:56:34.662 --> 00:56:36.564
- Yeah. yeah. right here. Right
here.

896
00:56:37.265 --> 00:56:37.932
See?

897
00:56:39.734 --> 00:56:42.036
Look. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm real
sorry.

898
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:43.137
I'm real sorry.

899
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:44.305
(blow striking)

900
00:56:44.338 --> 00:56:45.506
(clerk gasping)

901
00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:46.774
- Hold him down.

902
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:50.511
- No. please!

903
00:56:50.544 --> 00:56:51.646
- Open his mouth.

904
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.516
(clerk gasping)

905
00:56:56.416 --> 00:56:58.719
Swallow it!

906
00:57:01.522 --> 00:57:03.925
Swallow it. junkie puta!

907
00:57:11.899 --> 00:57:15.269
Now. that's how you keep someone
doped up.

908
00:57:15.303 --> 00:57:18.639
(soft dramatic music)

909
00:57:23.544 --> 00:57:26.981
(siren blaring in distance)

910
00:57:27.014 --> 00:57:29.951
(soft dramatic music)

911
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.896
(phone ringing)

912
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.164
- Hey. Nate.

913
00:58:17.198 --> 00:58:18.799
- Everything go as planned?

914
00:58:18.833 --> 00:58:22.136
- Yeah. she's safe and sound.
You get the email I sent?

915
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:25.973
- Yeah. looking at it now.
Thanks for helping me with this.

916
00:58:26.007 --> 00:58:29.010
Our resources on the island are
tight.

917
00:58:29.043 --> 00:58:29.977
- Yeah. happy to help.

918
00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:34.048
You know. the fingerprints
belong to a sicario.

919
00:58:34.081 --> 00:58:36.951
a member of a pretty
vicious Colombian cartel.

920
00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:39.420
What's going on down there. man?

921
00:58:39.453 --> 00:58:40.321
Give it to me straight.

922
00:58:40.354 --> 00:58:41.355
Mark aint telling me anything.

923
00:58:41.389 --> 00:58:44.158
and these are not small-town
players.

924
00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:45.059
- I know.

925
00:58:46.127 --> 00:58:46.994
I got to go.

926
00:58:48.329 --> 00:58:49.497
Thanks again.

927
00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:50.197
- You got it.

928
00:58:52.133 --> 00:58:55.669
(soft suspenseful music)

929
00:59:17.158 --> 00:59:20.094
(printer whirring)

930
00:59:23.631 --> 00:59:26.300
(horn beeping)

931
00:59:26.333 --> 00:59:28.903
(doors closing)

932
00:59:30.104 --> 00:59:32.106
- Hey. Yvonne. Good to see you.
welcome.

933
00:59:32.873 --> 00:59:33.542
Akilah.

934
00:59:33.574 --> 00:59:35.109
- Hi. Teseam. Glad to see you.

935
00:59:35.376 --> 00:59:36.243
- Hey. Brother.

936
00:59:36.644 --> 00:59:38.946
(children laughing)

937
00:59:38.979 --> 00:59:40.881
Hey. guys. let's go. Come
inside.

938
00:59:41.582 --> 00:59:43.117
Welcome to my home.

939
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:49.890
Hey. you kids be careful
around our guests. okay?

940
00:59:49.924 --> 00:59:52.426
- It's okay. the laughter of
children

941
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.295
is the most beautiful thing in
the world.

942
00:59:55.262 --> 00:59:58.632
You know. I remember when
you two were the same age.

943
00:59:58.666 --> 01:00:00.067
nothing but trouble (laughs).

944
01:00:03.737 --> 01:00:05.272
- Kids. get in here and eat.

945
01:00:06.707 --> 01:00:07.842
- I'll help you with that.

946
01:00:08.075 --> 01:00:11.011
- Thanks. Yvonne. Welcome to our
home.

947
01:00:11.045 --> 01:00:11.679
- Thank you.

948
01:00:11.712 --> 01:00:12.713
- Hey. Dayana.

949
01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.281
- Hello. Mark. It's good to see
you.

950
01:00:14.315 --> 01:00:15.182
- You too.

951
01:00:17.384 --> 01:00:18.452
Are you sure this is okay?

952
01:00:18.486 --> 01:00:19.887
- Of course.

953
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.988
Dayana and I wish that there
was more we could do to help.

954
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:24.258
- Hey. taking care of my mother
and Akilah

955
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.993
is more than enough. bro.

956
01:00:26.026 --> 01:00:28.395
- You mean taking care of your
mother.

957
01:00:28.429 --> 01:00:29.930
I'm not staying.

958
01:00:29.964 --> 01:00:31.298
- Akilah. you need to stay here.

959
01:00:31.332 --> 01:00:35.002
- What I need is to be
there for my island.

960
01:00:35.035 --> 01:00:36.337
- Akilah. please.

961
01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.972
- And to be there for you too.

962
01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:40.975
(soft music)

963
01:00:44.044 --> 01:00:47.014
- All right. I'll be
back as soon as I can.

964
01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:50.619
- Stay safe. my friends.

965
01:00:50.651 --> 01:00:51.685
Don't worry about your mother.

966
01:00:51.719 --> 01:00:53.888
She gonna be safe here with us.

967
01:00:53.921 --> 01:00:56.023
Akilah. take care. Be safe.

968
01:00:56.056 --> 01:00:56.991
- Thank you.

969
01:01:03.297 --> 01:01:05.966
(bell tolling)

970
01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:17.011
(footsteps approaching)

971
01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:24.185
(soft music)

972
01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:29.156
- Forgive me. Father.

973
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:33.160
I can't even remember the
last time I came to church.

974
01:01:34.596 --> 01:01:36.197
- As one of God's children.

975
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:38.399
all that matters is that you are
here now.

976
01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:43.103
Go on. What is on your mind. my
son?

977
01:01:44.639 --> 01:01:46.207
- I need to ask you to
do something for me.

978
01:01:49.511 --> 01:01:50.978
Please keep it safe.

979
01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:53.080
- I don't understand. What is
it?

980
01:01:54.348 --> 01:01:56.016
- If anything happens to me.

981
01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.952
open it and I'll trust
you'll know what to do.

982
01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:01.255
(soft music)

983
01:02:05.826 --> 01:02:09.029
(singer vocalizing)

984
01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:14.703
(birds singing and calling)

985
01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:18.038
- We could be in real trouble
here.

986
01:02:18.339 --> 01:02:19.940
We sent the Amore.

987
01:02:19.974 --> 01:02:24.078
- Si. Carla (speaks Spanish).

988
01:02:24.111 --> 01:02:26.146
I take care. don't worry about
it. okay?

989
01:02:27.515 --> 01:02:29.116
- I might have a solution.

990
01:02:29.149 --> 01:02:31.720
- You better. because if they
have her.

991
01:02:31.752 --> 01:02:33.854
then she can testify against
you.

992
01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:35.289
- I'll find her.

993
01:02:35.322 --> 01:02:36.691
- No you won't.

994
01:02:36.725 --> 01:02:38.959
If she's gone. it means they got
to her.

995
01:02:39.728 --> 01:02:41.996
And if they got to her. then
that means

996
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:44.465
they can bring an international
warrant against me.

997
01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:48.235
- And if you're still here.

998
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:51.305
it means that little piece
of shit is still breathing.

999
01:02:51.338 --> 01:02:54.074
- He is. but we have a card to
play.

1000
01:02:54.108 --> 01:02:55.342
if you're willing to play it.

1001
01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:59.146
- I'm willing to play
it. Do what it takes.

1002
01:02:59.179 --> 01:02:59.980
- It's messy.

1003
01:03:00.014 --> 01:03:01.650
- Everything I did for this
island

1004
01:03:01.683 --> 01:03:04.084
is in jeopardy because of this
man!

1005
01:03:04.118 --> 01:03:07.488
I will make a mess if
I have to. believe me.

1006
01:03:07.522 --> 01:03:11.091
(soft suspenseful music)

1007
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:26.473
(crickets chirping)

1008
01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:33.080
- I don't understand
why you just don't let

1009
01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:34.616
Nate make a case against him.

1010
01:03:34.649 --> 01:03:36.884
And put an end to all of this.

1011
01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:38.852
With that singer's testimony.

1012
01:03:38.886 --> 01:03:41.055
he'll spend the rest of his life
in jail.

1013
01:03:41.088 --> 01:03:44.224
- Because guys like him
don't end up in jail. Akilah.

1014
01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:48.262
- Mark. he's never going to
stop.

1015
01:03:48.295 --> 01:03:49.096
- And neither am I.

1016
01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:53.133
There's only one way this ends.

1017
01:03:55.770 --> 01:04:00.140
- To carry a life inside
of me. for nine months.

1018
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.243
one that you and I created
together.

1019
01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:08.583
And to never get to hear her
cry.

1020
01:04:10.284 --> 01:04:13.354
Or see her open her eyes to look
at me.

1021
01:04:13.387 --> 01:04:16.090
To never get to hold her against
my skin.

1022
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:19.159
Or see her take her first steps.

1023
01:04:20.628 --> 01:04:21.995
Or watch her grow up.

1024
01:04:22.797 --> 01:04:23.631
- Akilah.

1025
01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:25.933
- It broke me. in more ways

1026
01:04:25.966 --> 01:04:27.468
than I ever thought was
possible.

1027
01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:35.042
I was so. so numb to everything
that wasn't heartache.

1028
01:04:37.712 --> 01:04:39.012
And I know it broke you too.

1029
01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.117
It broke you so much
that you had to leave.

1030
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:45.085
- Akilah. why are you
talking about this now?

1031
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:47.655
- Because nothing that either of
us does

1032
01:04:47.689 --> 01:04:49.089
will ever bring her back.

1033
01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:51.593
She's gone. Mark.

1034
01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:54.161
You can't save her.

1035
01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:56.430
- But I can save our island.

1036
01:04:56.463 --> 01:04:57.599
- But at what cost?

1037
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.336
I don't want to lose you too.

1038
01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:07.474
I don't think that I could
take being broken anymore.

1039
01:05:08.942 --> 01:05:10.310
- You will never lose me.

1040
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.284
(vehicle approaching)

1041
01:05:17.317 --> 01:05:18.085
It's Nate.

1042
01:05:18.118 --> 01:05:21.455
(soft suspenseful music)

1043
01:05:23.457 --> 01:05:25.593
(door opening)

1044
01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:26.493
Nate?

1045
01:05:30.732 --> 01:05:32.700
Nate? Talk to me.

1046
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:36.538
Wait here.

1047
01:05:38.472 --> 01:05:39.339
Nate?

1048
01:05:41.576 --> 01:05:43.243
Nate?

1049
01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:44.011
- Mark.

1050
01:05:49.584 --> 01:05:52.152
- Nate. Hey. talk to me.

1051
01:05:53.053 --> 01:05:55.657
- Mark (breathes hard).

1052
01:05:56.524 --> 01:06:00.060
I'm sorry about this. They're
gonna kill your family.

1053
01:06:00.093 --> 01:06:03.531
- Sh. relax. Take deep breaths.

1054
01:06:03.565 --> 01:06:07.067
Slow. slow. Everything's
gonna be all right.

1055
01:06:07.669 --> 01:06:10.204
(gun firing)

1056
01:06:11.506 --> 01:06:14.542
(guns firing)

1057
01:06:14.576 --> 01:06:17.377
(dramatic music)

1058
01:06:20.515 --> 01:06:22.416
(Akilah grunting)

1059
01:06:22.449 --> 01:06:23.484
Akilah!

1060
01:06:23.518 --> 01:06:25.720
(guns firing)

1061
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.389
(elbow striking)

1062
01:06:29.423 --> 01:06:32.125
(blows striking)

1063
01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:33.994
(stun gun zapping)

1064
01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:38.432
(guns firing)

1065
01:06:38.465 --> 01:06:40.735
(body thudding)

1066
01:06:40.768 --> 01:06:42.804
(dramatic music)

1067
01:06:42.837 --> 01:06:45.472
(gun firing)

1068
01:06:47.842 --> 01:06:50.578
(engine fading)

1069
01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:54.348
- I'm sorry.

1070
01:06:54.616 --> 01:06:56.016
- Sh sh. sh sh.

1071
01:06:57.284 --> 01:06:58.118
Relax.

1072
01:06:59.086 --> 01:07:02.757
Think about all the times we. we
were here

1073
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:04.692
and we played cricket together.

1074
01:07:06.828 --> 01:07:09.129
- (groans) With your brother.

1075
01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:15.168
- I'm so glad that you were
able to help teach him for me.

1076
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:19.106
And he was always so
stubborn. and before long.

1077
01:07:20.407 --> 01:07:21.776
he was better than both of us.

1078
01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:27.314
Take care of him. my friend.

1079
01:07:28.583 --> 01:07:30.350
until we meet again.

1080
01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:32.520
(soft music)

1081
01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:39.293
(singer vocalizing)

1082
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:45.800
- God commands us to speak up
for those

1083
01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:48.435
who cannot speak for themselves.

1084
01:07:49.771 --> 01:07:51.706
For the rights of the destitute.

1085
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.443
To speak up. To judge fairly.

1086
01:07:56.476 --> 01:07:59.212
Reach out to someone in your
community.

1087
01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:00.480
One of your neighbors.

1088
01:08:00.515 --> 01:08:03.751
Help those less fortunate than
yourself.

1089
01:08:04.886 --> 01:08:06.186
This is what God--

1090
01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:08.422
(door opening)

1091
01:08:08.455 --> 01:08:11.926
- I'm sorry. Father. May I
please speak with everyone?

1092
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.361
Just for a moment?

1093
01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:15.495
- Here.

1094
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.163
- Thank you.

1095
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:25.840
My family immigrated to
this island from the States

1096
01:08:25.873 --> 01:08:28.509
when I was only two years old.

1097
01:08:28.543 --> 01:08:33.514
Many of this community helped
us to build a new life here.

1098
01:08:33.815 --> 01:08:36.116
so that we could call
this island our home.

1099
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:40.955
Now look. I know many of you

1100
01:08:40.989 --> 01:08:44.324
rely on the jobs and the many
businesses

1101
01:08:44.358 --> 01:08:48.362
owned by Manuel Alvarez.

1102
01:08:49.764 --> 01:08:51.131
But I'm here to tell you

1103
01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.902
that he has taken Akilah hostage

1104
01:08:56.436 --> 01:08:58.740
and has killed both my brother
Akheem

1105
01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:04.277
and now. my friend. our
police chief. Nate Wayland.

1106
01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:07.548
(congregation gasping)

1107
01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:10.518
Nate Wayland died an honorable
man.

1108
01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:13.955
who fought for what's
right and for the island

1109
01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:16.791
that we love and have called
home.

1110
01:09:16.824 --> 01:09:22.195
Please. don't let him or
my brother die in vain.

1111
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:24.565
Help me find Akilah.

1112
01:09:26.034 --> 01:09:28.536
And help me put an end to this
devil

1113
01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:31.873
who has coiled himself around
all our feet

1114
01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:35.175
and is trying to choke the
life out of our island.

1115
01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:40.280
Please. if you hear or see
anything.

1116
01:09:41.582 --> 01:09:43.685
reach out to me at the police
station.

1117
01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:45.887
Thank you.

1118
01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:49.289
- That concludes everything for
today.

1119
01:09:52.694 --> 01:09:54.829
Mark? A moment please.

1120
01:09:55.897 --> 01:09:58.633
(birds singing)

1121
01:10:04.539 --> 01:10:06.239
Nate asked me to hold onto it.

1122
01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.078
- What is it?

1123
01:10:10.111 --> 01:10:11.179
- I don't know.

1124
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:12.980
He said. if something happened
to him.

1125
01:10:14.082 --> 01:10:16.450
And with his passing. I just
think

1126
01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:17.852
he would want you to have it.

1127
01:10:19.319 --> 01:10:20.822
- Thank you. Father.

1128
01:10:20.855 --> 01:10:23.691
(dramatic music)

1129
01:10:30.464 --> 01:10:32.332
- Wake up. bitch (laughs)!

1130
01:10:37.105 --> 01:10:37.972
- Where am I?

1131
01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:43.443
What do you want with me?

1132
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:46.013
Answer me!

1133
01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:49.884
(soft dramatic music)

1134
01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:52.954
- She's not answering you
because she don't work for you.

1135
01:10:54.122 --> 01:10:55.790
She work for me.

1136
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.631
(sighs) And I'm getting really
tired

1137
01:11:03.664 --> 01:11:06.601
of your boyfriend getting in my
way.

1138
01:11:06.634 --> 01:11:10.037
- Then you're really gonna
be upset when he kills you.

1139
01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:12.774
- Oh. aren't you a clever one?

1140
01:11:14.642 --> 01:11:18.311
But it's going to be hard to
be clever without a tongue.

1141
01:11:19.412 --> 01:11:20.380
(Akilah spitting)

1142
01:11:20.413 --> 01:11:22.650
(hand slapping)

1143
01:11:22.683 --> 01:11:24.451
- You're gonna pay for that.
bitch.

1144
01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:27.387
Then just get it over with and
kill me now

1145
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.589
if you're really gonna do it.

1146
01:11:28.623 --> 01:11:30.992
- In time. I'll do just that.

1147
01:11:31.926 --> 01:11:36.931
But unfortunately for
you. it won't be quick.

1148
01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:42.369
No. I'm going to take my
time and enjoy so much.

1149
01:11:44.639 --> 01:11:49.510
Eventually. you'll beg me to
kill you.

1150
01:11:49.544 --> 01:11:52.780
(Akilah breathing hard)

1151
01:11:52.814 --> 01:11:56.784
(soft suspenseful music)

1152
01:11:56.818 --> 01:11:57.985
Don't leave her sight.

1153
01:12:02.123 --> 01:12:04.292
(laughing)

1154
01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:06.928
(dramatic music)

1155
01:12:15.136 --> 01:12:16.003
- Everyone.

1156
01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:18.405
Listen up.

1157
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.876
(phone ringing)

1158
01:12:23.578 --> 01:12:25.580
Nate was a good man who died

1159
01:12:25.613 --> 01:12:28.015
fighting to protect this island.

1160
01:12:28.049 --> 01:12:32.687
And now. I have taken over
as acting chief of police

1161
01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.690
so I can do what needs to be
done.

1162
01:12:35.723 --> 01:12:40.528
Now if any of you would like
to leave. you can leave now.

1163
01:12:43.764 --> 01:12:44.599
Good.

1164
01:12:45.498 --> 01:12:47.668
Now the first thing I want you
to do

1165
01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.804
is get the word out all across
the island

1166
01:12:49.837 --> 01:12:54.041
that I will be here. waiting for
Alvarez.

1167
01:12:54.075 --> 01:12:56.878
(suspenseful music)

1168
01:13:16.463 --> 01:13:18.866
(Mark exhaling)

1169
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.869
(suspenseful music)

1170
01:13:26.507 --> 01:13:29.043
(keys clicking)

1171
01:13:30.044 --> 01:13:30.912
Ah.

1172
01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:33.948
(suspenseful music)

1173
01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:35.917
Okay.

1174
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:38.953
Cartel drug money.

1175
01:13:39.987 --> 01:13:43.423
You've been building
a case against Alvarez

1176
01:13:43.456 --> 01:13:45.559
for money laundering.

1177
01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:49.063
Mm. gotcha.

1178
01:13:50.998 --> 01:13:54.001
(children laughing)

1179
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:56.604
- I won!

1180
01:13:56.637 --> 01:13:59.240
- No fair. You're taller.

1181
01:13:59.273 --> 01:14:00.207
(birds singing)

1182
01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:01.976
- Look. Desmond.

1183
01:14:02.009 --> 01:14:02.843
- Who's that?

1184
01:14:02.877 --> 01:14:03.811
- Sh.

1185
01:14:04.779 --> 01:14:05.613
Come on.

1186
01:14:05.646 --> 01:14:08.983
(soft suspenseful music)

1187
01:14:15.256 --> 01:14:16.991
That's the guy who's always with
him.

1188
01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:22.096
Did he see us?

1189
01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:22.797
- No.

1190
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:24.899
- Come on. Let's get outta here.

1191
01:14:27.134 --> 01:14:29.870
(phone buzzing)

1192
01:14:34.175 --> 01:14:35.309
- Hello.

1193
01:14:35.343 --> 01:14:37.611
- A police officer just came
here looking for the boss.

1194
01:14:37.645 --> 01:14:38.946
- What'd you tell him?

1195
01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.948
- That he wasn't here and
I don't know where he is.

1196
01:14:40.982 --> 01:14:42.650
- All right. you did the right
thing.

1197
01:14:42.683 --> 01:14:43.918
- Wait. there's more.

1198
01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:45.786
Before he left. he told
me that Mark has replaced

1199
01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.822
the chief of police and
now he's at the station

1200
01:14:47.855 --> 01:14:49.757
waiting for the boss to make a
move.

1201
01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:51.826
- Understood.

1202
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.495
(phone beeping)

1203
01:14:55.529 --> 01:14:57.765
(knocking on door)

1204
01:14:57.798 --> 01:15:00.768
- Excuse me. sir. these two
children say that they saw

1205
01:15:00.801 --> 01:15:03.304
something and may be able to
help you.

1206
01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:04.872
- Oh. Hello. kids.

1207
01:15:05.606 --> 01:15:07.942
So. what did you see?

1208
01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:09.210
- Mr. Mark?

1209
01:15:09.243 --> 01:15:10.911
- Just Mark is fine.

1210
01:15:10.945 --> 01:15:11.912
- We saw him.

1211
01:15:12.546 --> 01:15:13.714
- Who did you see?

1212
01:15:13.748 --> 01:15:16.884
- The man who is always
with the Manuel guy.

1213
01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:20.955
- Oh. mean-looking guy. looks
like Mr. Clean. never smiles?

1214
01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:21.956
- Yeah. that's him.

1215
01:15:23.324 --> 01:15:25.326
- So. where was this?

1216
01:15:25.359 --> 01:15:28.496
- We saw him at the old
abandoned hotel.

1217
01:15:28.529 --> 01:15:29.897
- The one by the water?

1218
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:30.798
- Yep.

1219
01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.202
- You two kids did very well.

1220
01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:39.807
But listen. do not go
anywhere near there. okay?

1221
01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.543
And tell nobody. It's
very. very important.

1222
01:15:42.576 --> 01:15:43.644
- Okay.
- Okay.

1223
01:15:44.513 --> 01:15:46.647
- All right. run along.

1224
01:15:48.582 --> 01:15:49.650
Thanks. Sergeant.

1225
01:15:52.753 --> 01:15:54.922
- Awfully young for some CIs.

1226
01:15:56.057 --> 01:15:58.059
- Phil. what the hell are you
doing here?

1227
01:15:58.092 --> 01:16:00.327
- Not exactly a warm island
welcome.

1228
01:16:00.361 --> 01:16:02.329
It's nice to see you too.
partner.

1229
01:16:02.363 --> 01:16:04.832
- This does not concern you.

1230
01:16:04.865 --> 01:16:07.001
- Oh. it doesn't concern me.

1231
01:16:07.034 --> 01:16:11.739
Well. um. I have been
stashing potential witnesses

1232
01:16:11.772 --> 01:16:13.941
for you in safe houses
and running fingerprints

1233
01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:16.343
for your buddy Nate on a
Colombia sicario

1234
01:16:16.377 --> 01:16:17.978
working for the Cali Cartel.

1235
01:16:18.012 --> 01:16:19.780
But. sure. it doesn't concern
me.

1236
01:16:19.814 --> 01:16:21.916
I'm good. by the way.
Thank you. for not asking.

1237
01:16:24.752 --> 01:16:25.920
- How's the girl?

1238
01:16:25.953 --> 01:16:29.090
- She's safe. Hence the word
safe house.

1239
01:16:30.124 --> 01:16:31.025
How's your buddy Nate?

1240
01:16:32.226 --> 01:16:34.028
- Well he's been killed.

1241
01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:37.131
Hence. why I'm sitting at his
desk.

1242
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.136
- Then I guess you need my
help more than I thought.

1243
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:45.039
Come on. cut the bullshit.
man. Catch me up.

1244
01:16:47.274 --> 01:16:49.643
(Mark sighing)

1245
01:16:49.677 --> 01:16:52.880
(suspenseful music)

1246
01:16:59.653 --> 01:17:02.189
(phone buzzing)

1247
01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:06.093
- Who's this?

1248
01:17:06.827 --> 01:17:09.029
- [Manuel] I think it's time we
meet.

1249
01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:10.831
- When and where?

1250
01:17:11.699 --> 01:17:14.902
- Tomorrow. 7:00 AM.

1251
01:17:14.935 --> 01:17:16.937
At the old sugar factory in
ruin.

1252
01:17:17.638 --> 01:17:20.575
Come alone. Unarmed.

1253
01:17:20.609 --> 01:17:23.177
And bring Nora. I'll bring
Akilah.

1254
01:17:24.845 --> 01:17:27.014
- I need to know she's alive.

1255
01:17:34.822 --> 01:17:37.358
- Your boyfriend. he want
to know you're still alive.

1256
01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:40.562
- Mark. don't worry about
me! Kill the bastard!

1257
01:17:40.595 --> 01:17:42.930
- Oh. she's a nasty one.

1258
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:44.398
7:00 AM.

1259
01:17:44.431 --> 01:17:47.968

01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:59.246
(phone ringing)

1261
01:18:00.781 --> 01:18:02.116
- Oh. yo. Mark. what's up. man?

1262
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:04.919
This beach house you got me
is fucking bitchin'. dude.

1263
01:18:04.952 --> 01:18:06.754
I could see myself
staying here a long time.

1264
01:18:06.787 --> 01:18:08.889
- Phil. Phil. listen.

1265
01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:11.825
I just spoke to Alvarez. I
need you to assemble a team.

1266
01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:14.195
We leave first thing in the
morning.

1267
01:18:14.228 --> 01:18:15.062
- Copy that. buddy.

1268
01:18:16.497 --> 01:18:18.866
(engine starting)

1269
01:18:18.899 --> 01:18:22.102
(suspenseful music)

1270
01:18:39.486 --> 01:18:42.156
(engine stopping)

1271
01:18:44.758 --> 01:18:46.126
- I'm here. What's your 20?

1272
01:18:47.761 --> 01:18:50.497
- Little busy. Let me get back
to you.

1273
01:18:50.532 --> 01:18:54.034
(intense dramatic music)

1274
01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:14.088
Moving in position now.

1275
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:16.423
- All right. you got five
minutes.

1276
01:19:16.457 --> 01:19:17.825
- Okay. Dad.

1277
01:19:17.858 --> 01:19:20.027
I'm embarrassed you think
it's gonna take me that long.

1278
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.795
- Well I'm accounting for
four minutes of your blabbing

1279
01:19:21.829 --> 01:19:23.998
and one minute of actual action.

1280
01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:25.165
- You know. this only works
if one of us is the funny one

1281
01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:27.268
and the other one's mean and
gruff. right?

1282
01:19:27.301 --> 01:19:30.437
- Hurry the fuck up and
save Akilah. Better?

1283
01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:32.973
- I did miss you. Going dark.

1284
01:19:43.884 --> 01:19:47.221
(intense dramatic music)

1285
01:20:04.506 --> 01:20:07.107
(guns firing)

1286
01:20:12.413 --> 01:20:14.148
Let's move. Come on!

1287
01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:18.185
(soft suspenseful music)

1288
01:20:24.559 --> 01:20:27.461
(footsteps crunching)

1289
01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:31.031

1290
01:20:38.972 --> 01:20:41.075
(gun clicking)

1291
01:20:44.478 --> 01:20:45.145

1292
01:21:00.528 --> 01:21:02.196
He's clean.

1293
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:03.097
- Good.

1294
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:12.139
Well. I appreciate a man who
shows up

1295
01:21:12.172 --> 01:21:14.441
early for an appointment.

1296
01:21:14.475 --> 01:21:15.943
- Where's Akilah?

1297
01:21:15.976 --> 01:21:17.177
- Where is Nora?

1298
01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:20.013
- You'll get her as soon
as I know Akilah's safe.

1299
01:21:20.447 --> 01:21:23.651
- You know. I don't think you're
really

1300
01:21:23.685 --> 01:21:25.452
in a position to negotiate here.

1301
01:21:25.486 --> 01:21:26.554
Where is she?

1302
01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:29.056
- I just need to make a call.

1303
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:32.627
- Well. I suggest you do just
that.

1304
01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.996
(soft suspenseful music)

1305
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.000
- I need you to bring her now.

1306
01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:44.071
Do you copy?

1307
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.643
(intense dramatic music)

1308
01:22:13.568 --> 01:22:16.170
(guns firing)

1309
01:22:17.672 --> 01:22:20.307
- Talk to me. Is there a
problem?

1310
01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:24.144
- No problem. It's just that
we're here early. remember?

1311
01:22:26.313 --> 01:22:28.148
- Don't waste my fucking time.

1312
01:22:28.182 --> 01:22:32.085
- Wait wait. Wait. hey.
let's talk about this. huh?

1313
01:22:32.119 --> 01:22:34.955
- Drop it and come out real
slow.

1314
01:22:34.988 --> 01:22:38.526
- All right here. look. My gun.
all right?

1315
01:22:40.093 --> 01:22:42.764
Here we go. okay? That's all I
want.

(screaming)

1318
01:22:45.432 --> 01:22:46.568
You're a dick.

1319
01:22:48.402 --> 01:22:49.069
Shit.

1320
01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:53.675
Hey. hey. I'm with Mark. Akilah.
right?

1321
01:22:53.708 --> 01:22:55.075
We gotta get you outta here.

1322
01:22:55.108 --> 01:22:57.645
(ropes stretching)

1323
01:22:57.679 --> 01:23:00.314
(thug shouting in Spanish)

1324
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:02.951
- Drop the gun!

1325
01:23:02.983 --> 01:23:05.085
- All right. hey. taking the gun
out.

1326
01:23:05.118 --> 01:23:07.589
Taking the gun out. Okay?

1327
01:23:07.622 --> 01:23:08.288
- [Thug] Guns!

1328
01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:10.758
- Okay. okay (speaks Spanish).

1329
01:23:10.792 --> 01:23:12.159
- Shut up!

1330
01:23:12.192 --> 01:23:15.262
- (speaks Spanish) See?

1331
01:23:16.363 --> 01:23:17.297
See?

1332
01:23:17.331 --> 01:23:18.833
Okay. okay.

1333
01:23:18.867 --> 01:23:21.669
Tranqilo. amigo. huh (speaks
Spanish).

(Phil chuckling)

1339
01:23:37.084 --> 01:23:38.820
- She. she's safe. Mark.

1340
01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:40.287
- [Phil] She's safe.

1341
01:23:41.154 --> 01:23:44.091
- It's seven o'clock. Where is
she?

1342
01:23:44.124 --> 01:23:46.159
- Nora won't be coming back to
the island.

1343
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:49.597
She's safe.

1344
01:23:49.631 --> 01:23:51.633
(suspenseful music)

1345
01:23:51.666 --> 01:23:55.570
- Well. I wish I could say
the same for Akilah. Kill her.

1346
01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:00.508
(gun clicking)

1347
01:24:01.743 --> 01:24:02.710

Did you hear me? Kill
the (shouts in Spanish)!

1349
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:10.818
- I don't believe they can hear
you.

1350
01:24:10.852 --> 01:24:13.555
because they're in the
afterlife.

1351
01:24:13.588 --> 01:24:16.858
(suspenseful music)

1352
01:24:16.891 --> 01:24:20.227
- Well. then.

1353
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.796
I have no more use for you.

1354
01:24:21.829 --> 01:24:23.196
Kill him.

1355
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:24.431
(gun firing)

1356
01:24:24.464 --> 01:24:26.433

(gun firing)

1360
01:24:37.879 --> 01:24:40.682
(dramatic music)

1361
01:24:54.762 --> 01:24:58.165
- You're right. Alvarez.
Things are changing.

1362
01:24:58.900 --> 01:24:59.801
Starting with you.

1363
01:25:01.836 --> 01:25:02.670
- Now what?

1364
01:25:03.771 --> 01:25:07.441
You're just gonna let your
little friends shoot me?

1365
01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:10.645
- I thought about it.

1366
01:25:11.512 --> 01:25:13.180
But I'm gonna give you a choice

1367
01:25:13.213 --> 01:25:15.482
that you didn't give my brother.

1368
01:25:15.516 --> 01:25:19.486
You wanna live? You
have to get through me.

1369
01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.122
(dramatic music)

1370
01:25:26.728 --> 01:25:28.830
- Let us shoot him. brother.

1371
01:25:28.863 --> 01:25:31.398
(soft music)

1372
01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:39.641
- I wish you could have
seen your brother's eyes

1373
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:42.744
when I bled the life from his
body.

1374
01:25:43.745 --> 01:25:46.146
- I guess I'm gonna have
to settle for yours.

1375
01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:50.685
(soft suspenseful music)

1376
01:25:54.221 --> 01:25:57.592

01:26:27.354 --> 01:26:30.457
(Manuel groaning)

1381
01:26:33.828 --> 01:26:36.531
- You don't know what you're
dealing with.

1382
01:26:36.564 --> 01:26:39.399
My associates will come for you.

1383
01:26:39.433 --> 01:26:41.936
- I look forward to it.

1384
01:26:41.969 --> 01:26:43.303
(both groaning)

1385
01:26:43.336 --> 01:26:46.273
(flesh tearing)

1386
01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:50.444
I told you the weather
was gonna be bad for you.

1387
01:26:51.679 --> 01:26:55.382
Now. look at me. This is the
last face you will ever see.

1388
01:26:56.483 --> 01:26:58.052
Take it to hell with you.

1389
01:26:58.086 --> 01:27:01.622
(knife stabbing)

1390
01:27:01.656 --> 01:27:04.491

(soft music)

1394
01:27:59.747 --> 01:28:02.683
- [Akilah] So. did you decide to
stay?

1395
01:28:04.952 --> 01:28:07.622
(Mark sighing)

1396
01:28:10.691 --> 01:28:13.027
(soft music)

1397
01:28:14.695 --> 01:28:17.397
(Akilah laughing)

1398
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:18.566
- I have never left.

1399
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.203
- You're right. You never did

1400
01:28:22.402 --> 01:28:24.939
(soft music)

1401
01:28:29.644 --> 01:28:33.881

No. cheers. cheers to you. All

1409
01:28:48.696 --> 01:28:53.100
- Yeah. believe it or not.
You'll get used to him.

1410
01:28:53.134 --> 01:28:55.736
