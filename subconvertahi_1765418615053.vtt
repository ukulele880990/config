We’re at Repouso Road.

78
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.582
No visual on suspect vehicle.

79
00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:40.916
What do you mean no visual?

80
00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:41.957
It’s right there.

81
00:04:41.957 --> 00:04:43.082
Are you all blind?

82
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:52.457
Madam.

83
00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:54.041
Can you see me?

84
00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:57.291
Madam.

85
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.083
What do we do now?

86
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:10.375
Pawn out.

87
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:14.291

Police.

93
00:06:26.082 --> 00:06:27.541
Sure about not going to the bank?

94
00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:28.416
Why would I want to go?

95
00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:30.916
The paper with half of my password was stolen. right?

96
00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.125
Right?

97
00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:34.000
They probably wouldn't act this fast.

98
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.291
No. they want the other half.

99
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.291
They need the other half.

100
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:37.166
Without the other half.

101
00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:38.082
all of this would be for nothing.

102
00:06:38.082 --> 00:06:39.957
What exactly is cryptocurrency?

103
00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:40.957
Money. sir.

104
00:06:40.957 --> 00:06:42.041
Over 500 million HK dollars.

105
00:06:42.457 --> 00:06:44.207
No answer at JH Digital Asset Management.

106
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.791
They may be doing it right now.

107
00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.207
Hi. Aoxing Tower security office.

108
00:06:52.207 --> 00:06:52.666
Hello. sir.

109
00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:54.750
This is Polícia Judiciária Command Center.

110
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.957
We suspect that someone on the 4th floor

111
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.625
at JH Digital Asset Management

112
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.541
is attempting to steal sensitive data.

113
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:00.791
Please don't act on your own.

114
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:02.166
What's the police's ETA?

115
00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.458
What's your ETA?

116
00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:04.166
Within five minutes.

117
00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:05.458
Understood.

118
00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:07.833
Three minutes.

119
00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:08.916
Got it. Three minutes.

120
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.416
Found it.

121
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.207
Damn...

122
00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:22.875
So many files.

123
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:23.582
Copy them all.

124
00:07:23.582 --> 00:07:25.041
Can't you transfer the money out yourself?

125
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.541
Account passwords for cryptocurrency

126
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:28.082
consist of twelve English words.

127
00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:28.957
all randomly generated.

128
00:07:28.957 --> 00:07:32.082
That's 2048 to the 12th power.

129
00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:33.582
That's an algorithm behind it.

130
00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:34.416
You've no idea.

131
00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:35.541
Sit back.

132
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:37.791
It's impossible to memorize.

133
00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:40.791
Two minutes.

134
00:07:54.582 --> 00:07:55.375
Xin. what are you doing?

135
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.082
Just look around.

136
00:07:56.082 --> 00:07:57.375
Don’t touch anything else.

137
00:07:58.332 --> 00:07:59.666
Lots of VIP clients.

138
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:04.583
Gordon D.

139
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:09.833
What is this?

140
00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:10.875
Digital encryption key.

141
00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:13.083
It's Duan Zhihong.

142
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:14.583
Who’s Duan Zhihong?

143
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:16.791
CEO of Kuala Lumpur's biggest crypto exchange.

144
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:18.250
He vanished with $1.5 billion USD.

145
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.250
then mysteriously turned up dead in Macau.

146
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.207
People still think he faked his own death.

147
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:25.541
This digital key's firewall is

148
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:26.957
TAQ-LX-5 level.

149
00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:28.166
What does that mean?

150
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:29.957
One level short of military-grade.

151
00:08:29.957 --> 00:08:30.875
Why is such an important key

152
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:32.500
hidden in a crappy server like this?

153
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.957
I heard Duan's $1.5 billion

154
00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:35.000
is still unaccounted for.

155
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.457
That's over HK$10 billion.

156
00:08:37.457 --> 00:08:38.207
Copy everything.

157
00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:39.875
We're out of time. Simon.

158
00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:40.582
Won't take long.

159
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.000
Xin. we’re leaving.

160
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.790
Give me a minute.

161
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.040
There's no time.

162
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:11.833
Go.

163
00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.125
Heads down.

164
00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:15.375
Don't look.

165
00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.166
Police are at the entrance.

166
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:26.958
Don’t panic.

167
00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:28.541
What’s going on upstairs?

168
00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:35.458
Sorry.

169
00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:36.625
Hi. who are you?

170
00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:37.250

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.540
Suspects just left.

Get them.

178
00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:53.583
Song. cut them off.

179
00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:57.458
Freeze.

180
00:09:57.458 --> 00:09:58.083
Stop.

181
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.415

189
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.915
Don't move.

190
00:10:57.708 --> 00:10:58.333
Freeze.

191
00:10:58.333 --> 00:10:58.790
Don't move.

192
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.625
Drop the gun.

193
00:10:59.915 --> 00:11:00.500
Drop the gun.

194
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.000
Don't move.

195
00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:02.333
Freeze.

196
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:03.000
Don't move.

197
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:03.958
Put the gun down.

198
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:05.333
Don't worry about me. do your job.

199
00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:09.166
Captain Wu's been held hostage.

200
00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:10.041
They're going up.

201
00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:12.208
Wynn Macau.

202
00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:12.875
The boys.

203
00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:13.416
may be...

204
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.166
Wynn. let's go.

205
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:16.958
What are you waiting for?

206
00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:43.208
Captain.

207
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:48.750
Wu Yaolei.

208
00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:13.500
Fake.

209
00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:27.708
-Help me. -Pull.

210
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.291
They have parachutes.

211
00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:33.540
Captain.

212
00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:38.125
Send reinforcements

213
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:38.915
to Wynn Macau.

214
00:12:38.915 --> 00:12:39.625
Go.

215
00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:41.583
Captain. elevators are hacked.

216
00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:42.458
How will you come down?

217
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.165
I'm jumping.

218
00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:45.040
Jumping?

219
00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:47.000
Stay where you are.

220
00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:04.333
Wynn Macau. rooftop.

221
00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:05.250
You really jumped?

222
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.166
Attention. all units.

223
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:08.333
Send backup to new target location.

224
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.166
Wynn Macau.

225
00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:10.125
Assist with the arrest.

226
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:11.291
I've called their security chief.

227
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.416
Mathew Tab.

228
00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:13.250
Sit back.

229
00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:14.041
They're coming on the rooftop.

230
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:14.750
Call for backup.

231
00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:15.791
Call for backup.

232
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.083
Call for backup.

233
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:17.791
Call for backup.

234
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:20.708
They must have a plan B.

235
00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:21.916
tell Tab to watch out.

236
00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:26.708
This isn't that simple.

237
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.041
What?

238
00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:48.125
What do you mean?

239
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.540
How can they just vanish

240
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.915
from all the cameras?

241
00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:51.875
That's what they did.

242
00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:09.541
You look like shit.

243
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.125
Where are they?

244
00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:12.250
They're in the hotel.

245
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.083
Xin. the police have arrived.

246
00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:18.208
That's fast.

247
00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:19.208
Rook route is dead.

248
00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:19.875
Take the queen route.

249
00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:20.916
How'd you let them run?

250
00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:22.833
They did not run. they flew.

251
00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:26.125
Fifteen seconds.

252
00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:26.750
Ready for Queen.

253
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.541
I need a location.

254
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:28.500
Looking for it.

255
00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:30.916
Find them. and fast.

256
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:36.375
What's going on?

257
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.083
Not us.

258
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.040
What the hell happened to my cameras?

259
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.958
Wynn's surveillance was remotely shut down.

260
00:14:44.875 --> 00:14:45.458
Everyone.

261
00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.290
Get moving.

262
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.165
Split up. eyes open.

263
00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:48.583
As long as they're still in here.

264
00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:49.833
they can't keep their faces hidden.

265
00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:00.125
Everyone.

266
00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.041
turn on your body cameras.

267
00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:04.000
Capture every face you come across.

268
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.625
Du Ping.

269
00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:08.541
Operate S.P.A.I.S. manually.

270
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:09.833
Run facial recognition on all live images

271
00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:10.833
caught on body cameras.

272
00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:11.375
On it.

273
00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:12.500
Find those without entry records.

274
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.666
starting with the staff area.

275
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:15.791
Don’t get caught on camera.

276
00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:17.125
Or we're screwed.

277
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:21.458
I'm in.

278
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:22.791
Tell me your whereabouts.

279
00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:24.958
I'll handle it from here.

280
00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:26.125
King's move.

281
00:15:38.165 --> 00:15:39.040
Turn around.

282
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.708
Locker room.

283
00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:45.208
Change.

284
00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:49.208
Excuse me. sir.

285
00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:50.040
Sir.

286
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.291
Alpha 2 is taking elevator MCS1 to Ground Floor.

287
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:10.250
Ray.

288
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.875
Turn around.

289
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.000
Take the cart at your 10.

290
00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:21.875
Attention all units.

291
00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:23.458
Suspects may have changed disguises.

292
00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.083
Stay sharp. keep moving.

293
00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:32.000
175 centimeters.

294
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.540
medium length hair.

295
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.833
black and white hooded baseball jacket.

296
00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:34.875
dark camouflage multi-pocket pants.

297
00:16:34.875 --> 00:16:35.333
Backpack.

298
00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:36.583
He just headed to the cafeteria.

299
00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:37.750
Xin.

300
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.708
You’re blown.

301
00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:39.583
Feng.

302
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:40.750
burn that face.

303
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.500
Help Xin.

304
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.333
Yes. sir.

305
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.040
Song. the guy who just passed by.

306
00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:57.375
Now.

307
00:16:57.665 --> 00:16:58.833
He has no entry record.

308
00:16:58.833 --> 00:16:59.375
What?

309
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:00.708
There.

310
00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:01.291
That's him.

311
00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:02.291
I got this one.

312
00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:03.666
Song. go after the other guy.

313
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.208
Excuse me.

314
00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:07.665
Song. wipe the lens.

315
00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:12.540
Go get that one.

316
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.040
Go.

317
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.250
Move.

318
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:41.083
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.583
Where is he?

320
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:53.333
The Wynn Prosperity Tree lobby is packed.

321
00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:01.458
I thought the show is after 12.

322
00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:02.833
When there's a system upgrade.

323
00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:04.500
they run a test show that morning.

324
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.333
Find them.

325
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:07.458
Spread out.

326
00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:09.250
Eyes peeled. stay sharp.

327
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:13.916
Over there.

328
00:18:18.416 --> 00:18:19.416
They're posing as cops.

329
00:18:19.541 --> 00:18:20.750
They're posing as cops.

330
00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:38.375
Checkmate.

331
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.375
It's all gone.

332
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:45.291
500 million.

333
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.291
Not a penny left.

334
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.291
Crypto is impossible to trace!

335
00:18:50.291 --> 00:18:52.666
You police are useless!

336
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:02.291
They hacked us

337
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:03.625
and infiltrated the surveillance system.

338
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.583
So...

339
00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:05.916
Without Skyeye.

340
00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:06.958
we can't fight crimes anymore.

341
00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:07.708
Is that it?

342
00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:09.958
Before we had all this technology.

343
00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.833
how did the police do their jobs?

344
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.125
It was my mistake.

345
00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:15.708
I'll catch them next time.

346
00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:16.833
Even if there's a next time.

347
00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.583
they'll probably still counter our every move.

348
00:19:19.583 --> 00:19:20.375
So tell me...

349
00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:21.250
What do we do?

350
00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:23.000
If they stop now.

351
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.166
where's our breakthrough?

352
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:26.041
Sorry. sir.

353
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.000
What's the progress

354
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.291
from cyber division?

355
00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:31.625
We've patched the intrusion point and code bugs.

356
00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:33.083
but no progress on reverse tracking.

357
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.208
To catch a cunning fox.

358
00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:39.625
we need an experienced hunter.

359
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.000
Are you suggesting

360
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.375
bringing back Wong?

361
00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:53.333
I know he's your old boss.

362
00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.708
But this is the era of A.I. tracking.

363
00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:56.708
And they've just exploited its weakness.

364
00:19:58.166 --> 00:19:59.250
There are flaws in the network

365
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.583
and surveillance equipment.

366
00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:02.000
but S.P.A.I.S. is flawless.

367
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.708
You stopped S.P.A.I.S. learning from real operations.

368
00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:06.208
You let your phone tell you how to do your job?

369
00:20:06.208 --> 00:20:07.583
That doesn't mean bringing in a fossil

370
00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:08.958
will fix the police's image.

371
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.916
Captain.

372
00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:13.875
I don't care if we use fossil or Spice Girl.

373
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:15.916
Find them. catch them.

374
00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:17.166
Do your job.

375
00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:22.500
Jeez. Guoguo.

376
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.458
have you seen Wong's file?

377
00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:26.375
He's incredible.

378
00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:28.666
Multiple commendations.

379
00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.375
Special Ops all-around champion.

380
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:33.125
Police hand-to-hand combat champion.

381
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:35.041
Five years straight!

382
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:36.291
Proficient in firearms.

383
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:36.916
surveillance.

384
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:37.708
infiltration.

385
00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:39.375
intelligence gathering.

386
00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:41.750
He’s gone undercover in drug cartels

387
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.291
and organ trafficking rings.

388
00:20:44.708 --> 00:20:46.458
Restrained. low-profile.

389
00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.916
Skilled at blending in.

390
00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:49.916
Hobby...

391
00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.000
Making up call signs.

392
00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:54.333
This says his career's single stain is

393
00:20:54.333 --> 00:20:58.125
a major personal mistake that killed

394
00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.375
his partner.

395
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:14.291
Write down which dog pees and poos first.

396
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.041
Is that really him?

397
00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:20.041
Hi.

398
00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:21.625
Have you find it?

399
00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:22.750
Nope.

400
00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:26.083
Everyone else is on the field for the big case

401
00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:29.083
and I have no idea what I’m doing.

402
00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:30.541
Observing someone's retirement?

403
00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:31.500
Be patient.

404
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.291
Maybe captain's looking out for you.

405
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.750
Perhaps we're not ready for the field yet.

406
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.416
I’ll call you later.

407
00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:12.666
A training drill on a geezer like me?

408
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:15.416
Come again?

409
00:22:19.916 --> 00:22:20.958
Why are you following me?

410
00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:25.791
You're mistaking me for someone else.

411
00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:29.250
You don’t know me?

412
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.083
I don't.

413
00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:35.375
Do you need something?

414
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:39.916
You weren't tailing me in a jacket in reverse?

415
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.333
Can you sit elsewhere?

416
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:53.958
Sorry.

417
00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:54.708
It’s fine.

418
00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:05.333
At 14:23. you reached the first target.

419
00:23:05.333 --> 00:23:07.375
which was the pet shop.

420
00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:08.041
Up to now.

421
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:10.708
you've tailed me for 4 hours and 17 minutes.

422
00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:12.500
You changed your outfit three times.

423
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.291
and stopped 9 times to jot notes.

424
00:23:15.458 --> 00:23:16.541
On the bus.

425
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:18.375
you had a colleague help you.

426
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:20.208
Watch it.

427
00:23:20.208 --> 00:23:20.833
Pardon me.

428
00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:22.625
Am I right. He Qiuguo?

429
00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:31.708
That look

430
00:23:31.708 --> 00:23:32.958
just gave you away.

431
00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:38.125
You remember me.

432
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:38.875
Uncle Wong.

433
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.958
We haven't met since I was 8.

434
00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:44.833
I heard you joined the force

435
00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:46.291
and inherited your father's badge number.

436
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.458
He would be proud.

437
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.708
How'd you know when I was at the pet shop?

438
00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:55.708
I have a few pointers.

439
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.750
First of all.

440
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.458
never throw away your notes.

441
00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:00.000
Second.

442
00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:00.750
dog walking time.

443
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.375
leaving work.

444
00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:02.583
and boarding the bus

445
00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:03.500
were all inaccurate.

446
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.708
The order of dogs pee and poo is a mess.

447
00:24:05.708 --> 00:24:07.333
Which one was the sixth to poop?

448
00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:08.250
Al Paca-paca.

449
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.166
the poodle.

450
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:17.375
It'd be my mistake if I didn't pick it up.

451
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:19.416
Confuse my memory if I did.

452
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.583
Not bad.

453
00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:23.125
You said my colleague was on the bus.

454
00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:23.958
Why do you say that?

455
00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:25.666
Oh. I see.

456
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.083
This isn't training.

457
00:24:27.083 --> 00:24:29.166
You're checking

458
00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:30.458
if I’ve still got it.

459
00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:40.000
You two tailed me for 4 hours at that skill level.

460
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.416
Who gave you the confidence?

461
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:00.875
Long time no see. Officer Wong.

462
00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:02.708
This is inspector Wu Yaolei.

463
00:25:06.083 --> 00:25:06.625
Let me do it.

464
00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:07.416
No.

465
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.750
You call yourself a cop?

466
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.541
No wonder I felt that old man touched me.

467
00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:17.500
Sound like you're proud of it.

468
00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:20.791
So the partner

469
00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:22.833
who died on duty...

470
00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:24.416
That was your dad?

471
00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:28.041
Back off.

472
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:32.875
These are footage we gathered from the scene.

473
00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:34.166
This footage is

474
00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.500
Wynn's feed before hackers cut it.

475
00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:46.750
Just play the last 15 seconds. please.

476
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.041
Play it again.

477
00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:08.041
Once more.

478
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.500
Stop.

479
00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:45.833
How did you spot them?

480
00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:47.958
They peeked at cameras when they entered.

481
00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:50.791
They must have scouted beforehand

482
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:51.916
and knew where the cameras were.

483
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:52.916
Why'd they look. then?

484
00:26:52.916 --> 00:26:54.625
To see if the cameras were still on.

485
00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:58.291
Once the cameras were cut.

486
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.583
they changed their disguises.

487
00:27:01.583 --> 00:27:02.333
Didn’t they?

488
00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:14.166
Xiwang.

489
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:25.333
Old man pissed over the change of plans?

490
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.041
What do you think?

491
00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.500
Go console him.

492
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.665
Godfather...

493
00:27:32.665 --> 00:27:33.750
We all made it back safely.

494
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.250
Hell of a day. wasn't it?

495
00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:36.750
I can explain.

496
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:40.458
You almost got everyone killed.

497
00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:42.125
That wasn’t part of the plan.

498
00:27:44.416 --> 00:27:45.791
But we got the job done.

499
00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:48.875
With a bonus. no less.

500
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.166
What bonus?

501
00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:52.458
I only saw mistakes.

502
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:56.000
All these years.

503
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.375
I've never been caught on camera.

504
00:27:57.791 --> 00:27:58.833
Now I have.

505
00:27:59.541 --> 00:28:00.958
you little shit!

506
00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:03.041
It'll be fine. I'll handle it.

507
00:28:03.041 --> 00:28:04.208
You're a little shit too.

508
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:07.041
Just let go.

509
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:08.833
Let us call the shots for once.

510
00:28:14.208 --> 00:28:15.041
Let go?

511
00:28:23.208 --> 00:28:24.291
Let go.

512
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:40.708
Can you tell me

513
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.375
what I should be scared of now?

514
00:28:48.708 --> 00:28:50.583
You wouldn't understand it anyway.

515
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:55.833
Let me tell you

516
00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:57.500
what you should fear.

517
00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:06.916
Godfather.

518
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:18.875
Even you're turning on me.

519
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.208
Godfather.

520
00:29:22.541 --> 00:29:23.708
It's our fault.

521
00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:25.708
For decades. no one's had a photo of me.

522
00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:27.458
That's changed because of you shitheads.

523
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.583
Don't be mad.

524
00:29:28.583 --> 00:29:30.375
That's more than 10 billion sweet HKD.

525
00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:31.125
With this money.

526
00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:32.625
we can all live our dreams.

527
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.416
Shut it. You know how deep you were in danger?

528
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.041
That tall guy.

529
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:45.958
The walking lightning rod changed outfits.

530
00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:46.791
Eyes on the screen.

531
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:47.916
Lightning Rod.

532
00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:49.833
Remember his characteristics.

533
00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:52.416
This guy. grinding his teeth.

534
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:53.416
Number 2. number 2.

535
00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:55.041
Found the one with the earrings.

536
00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:55.916
That's right.

537
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:56.708
That's him.

538
00:29:56.916 --> 00:29:57.375
Send it.

539
00:29:57.666 --> 00:29:58.208
On the screen.

540
00:29:58.208 --> 00:29:59.291
that's Lil Puppy no. 2.

541
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:00.833
Lightning Rod 3 spotted.

542
00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:01.625
not very clear though.

543
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:02.875
I've got a decent shot over here.

544
00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:03.833
Very good. very good.

545
00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:04.916
Pretty Face number 2.

546
00:30:04.916 --> 00:30:05.833
wearing a small mustache.

547
00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:06.166
Got it.

548
00:30:06.166 --> 00:30:07.083
I got Pretty Face number 3.

549
00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:07.666
The squatting one.

550
00:30:07.791 --> 00:30:08.458
He changed disguises.

551
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.166
How many fake mustaches does he have?

552
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.333
Sir. I think this one is...

553
00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:18.625
Pretty Face number 4.

554
00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:21.166
I've seen this coat somewhere.

555
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:25.333
Someone gave it to him!

556
00:30:25.625 --> 00:30:26.541
Everybody. listen up.

557
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:27.583
There's one more person.

558
00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:29.000
Cast everything you find

559
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.083
to the main screen.

560
00:30:30.083 --> 00:30:30.500
Yes. sir.

561
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:30.875
Yes. sir.

562
00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:31.416
Yes. sir.

563
00:30:48.166 --> 00:30:48.791
Police.

564
00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:49.375
Police.

565
00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:51.916
Sorry.

566
00:31:11.625 --> 00:31:12.250
Xiwang.

567
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:16.541
You saved my life once.

568
00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:21.125
I value this life very much.

569
00:31:23.583 --> 00:31:25.958
I don't want anything to happen to you all.

570
00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:29.458
Got that?

571
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:33.250
Got it.

572
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.500
We're with you.

573
00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:36.916
live or die.

574
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.916
I don't want to die.

575
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.541
I want all of us to enjoy our lives.

576
00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:00.041
Ms. Sun. the lobby café barista.

577
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:02.125
took this photo that afternoon.

578
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.041
This is very likely the fifth person at Wynn.

579
00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:06.333
Do we have any idea

580
00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:07.166
of his identity?

581
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:09.583
Sorry sir. not yet.

582
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.500
In the late 80s.

583
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.875
there was a wanted foreign ex-special force

584
00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:19.125
known as "The Shadow".

585
00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:22.666
He served in an elite assassination squad.

586
00:32:22.666 --> 00:32:24.625
During the war. he disguised himself

587
00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:26.958
to infiltrate military and political targets.

588
00:32:26.958 --> 00:32:29.000
His kills were executed up close with a knife.

589
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.166
And he always got away.

590
00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:32.833
Later. he fled here to seek greater wealth.

591
00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:35.875
He planned more than a dozen bank heists

592
00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:37.916
and evaded three manhunts

593
00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:39.791
before vanishing without a trace in 1999.

594
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:42.625
This guy could be the Shadow

595
00:32:43.541 --> 00:32:45.375
coming out of retirement.

596
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:47.083
I remember him.

597
00:32:47.083 --> 00:32:48.500
What's your next step?

598
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.541
This photo isn't enough for facial recognition.

599
00:32:51.541 --> 00:32:52.625
We plan to increase manpower

600
00:32:52.625 --> 00:32:54.416
for a comprehensive sweep.

601
00:32:54.416 --> 00:32:55.041
Area?

602
00:32:55.291 --> 00:32:57.541
We have few shots of his accomplice's vehicle.

603
00:32:57.541 --> 00:32:59.500
These were all taken in the Old Town area.

604
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.250
It’s a large area.

605
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.083
I suggest a two-pronged approach.

606
00:33:02.083 --> 00:33:03.708
Conduct an open sweep for diversion

607
00:33:03.708 --> 00:33:05.666
while dispatching a covert surveillance team.

608
00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:06.500
Officer Wong.

609
00:33:07.416 --> 00:33:09.083
There’s no covert surveillance team anymore.

610
00:33:09.083 --> 00:33:10.125
Not anymore?

611
00:33:10.333 --> 00:33:13.000
With today's surveillance network and A.I..

612
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.125
traditional covert surveillance teams

613
00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:16.458
are hardly ever needed.

614
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:22.250
Small suggestion

615
00:33:22.666 --> 00:33:23.916
for ground surveillance.

616
00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:26.625
You should use your most inconspicuous officers.

617
00:33:26.625 --> 00:33:28.791
Preferably ones suspects haven't seen before.

618
00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:35.708
Officer Wong.

619
00:33:36.166 --> 00:33:39.041
why don't you help us set up a temporary team?

620
00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:44.708
A covert team put together last-minute

621
00:33:44.708 --> 00:33:46.250
won’t be as effective as

622
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.500
a comprehensive approach.

623
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.291
Guoguo.

624
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.708
Stay in your lane out there.

625
00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.125
Leave the arresting to us.

626
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.333
Remember that.

627
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.291
Guoguo can show off all she wants.

628
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:09.333
I'm just worried that showing off will get to her head

629
00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:10.666
and let them slip away again.

630
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:17.375
Why did someone so tiny become a cop?

631
00:34:17.375 --> 00:34:19.083
Her old man was a cop.

632
00:34:19.083 --> 00:34:19.625
Doesn’t she know

633
00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:22.083
she's just a poster child?

634
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.833
Can't even crack a smile.

635
00:34:26.833 --> 00:34:28.833
What business is it of yours that I’m a cop?

636
00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:30.791
I earned my spot in the Police Force.

637
00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:32.000
How dare you.

638
00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:35.208
Don't forget. it was you idiots who let them get away.

639
00:34:36.916 --> 00:34:37.791
Com'on. I'm the suspect.

640
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:38.541
Catch me.

641
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:39.250
Com'on.

642
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.083
Field agent? Yeah. right.

643
00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:07.291
Come on.

644
00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:09.166
Com'on. get him.

645
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:26.208
In a place like the detective squad.

646
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:27.958
a little spar will earn you respect.

647
00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:30.083
They'll watch your back out there.

648
00:35:34.416 --> 00:35:36.166
No one in this place thinks

649
00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:38.541
a woman could be the first to kick down a door.

650
00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:41.875
The first one can catch a bullet. too.

651
00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:43.166
So what?

652
00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:44.458
I'm not afraid to die.

653
00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:46.125
But they don't want you to die.

654
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.250
My life isn’t their concern.

655
00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.416
They do care about their colleagues' lives.

656
00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:52.000
No one sees me as a colleague.

657
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.625
Old friend...

658
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.625
Guoguo's all grown up.

659
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:05.791
She's just like you.

660
00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:10.875
But I can tell she's not happy in the squad.

661
00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:14.583
That short fuse of hers

662
00:36:15.083 --> 00:36:16.332
might get her in trouble

663
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.666
out on the field.

664
00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:20.625
Freeze. Police.

665
00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:30.333
Rest assured.

666
00:36:30.333 --> 00:36:31.500
I'll look after her.

667
00:37:18.125 --> 00:37:19.041
I'll do it.

668
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:21.000
I'll train a covert surveillance team.

669
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.458
Let's catch him.

670
00:37:34.541 --> 00:37:36.750
How nice of Captain Wu to send so many.

671
00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:49.833
Thank you. Goodbye.

672
00:37:51.666 --> 00:37:52.833
You look like a cop.

673
00:37:55.041 --> 00:37:55.583
Thanks.

674
00:37:55.583 --> 00:37:56.166
Thanks.

675
00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:59.833
We're dealing with an old fox.

676
00:37:59.833 --> 00:38:01.125
An old-school thief.

677
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.250
That's why

678
00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:03.541
I'm going to train you

679
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:04.791
to become old-school hunters.

680
00:38:05.208 --> 00:38:05.791
Come.

681
00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:08.000
During surveillance.

682
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.958
develop an instinct to watch and memorize.

683
00:38:11.583 --> 00:38:12.208
One glance.

684
00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:13.291
That's all you get.

685
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:14.875
Focus on key characteristics.

686
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:18.000
Remember prominent and permanent features.

687
00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:20.000
I had my hands on my hips just now.

688
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.291
Which two fingers

689
00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:23.000
were in my belt loops?

690
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.916
Left forefinger.

691
00:38:23.916 --> 00:38:25.000
Right middle finger.

692
00:38:32.665 --> 00:38:34.708
A surveillance team is an entity.

693
00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:37.333
It takes every member

694
00:38:37.333 --> 00:38:38.833
to complete a mission.

695
00:38:40.083 --> 00:38:40.958
Let's go.

696
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.375
Guoguo.

697
00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:47.250
Get in.

698
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.416
Starting today. you need to blend into the city.

699
00:38:53.416 --> 00:38:54.666
Let's put theory into action.

700
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.708
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

701
00:38:56.958 --> 00:38:57.833
Officer Wong.

702
00:38:57.833 --> 00:38:58.666
what did you say?

703
00:38:59.041 --> 00:38:59.916
Doghead.

704
00:38:59.916 --> 00:39:00.500
That's me.

705
00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:02.541
My call sign.

706
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:04.375
Adorable Unit's on site.

707
00:39:05.041 --> 00:39:06.541
I'll give your call signs now.

708
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:07.875
Liu. you're Al Paca-paca.

709
00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:10.000
Can I get another one?

710
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:11.875
I'll make it simpler.

711
00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:12.666
Alpaca.

712
00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:15.000
Okay.

713
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.791
Wanwan...

714
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:16.583
You're Tofu.

715
00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:17.291
Yang Zhiwei...

716
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:17.958
Rice Noodles.

717
00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:18.708
Ting...

718
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.666
Pudding.

719
00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:21.083
Sun Xu....

720
00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:21.958
Potstickers.

721
00:39:21.958 --> 00:39:22.750
Liao Qihang...

722
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.708
Eggy.

723
00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:24.666
Qiao Weidong...

724
00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:25.291
Lucky.

725
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:26.458
Song Keyu...

726
00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:28.000
Pork Bun.

727
00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:31.875
Isn't that body shaming?

728
00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:33.250
It's a local specialty.

729
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.791
This is a foodie squad.

730
00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:36.250
Better than my old unit.

731
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:37.625
He Qiuguo...

732
00:39:38.708 --> 00:39:39.666
Little Flower Piggy.

733
00:39:40.166 --> 00:39:40.958
Can I change it?

734
00:39:40.958 --> 00:39:42.250
I'll drop "Little".

735
00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:44.791
Then drop "Flower".

736
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.583
Patience.

737
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.333
You're my ace in the hole.

738
00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:57.583
Like I believe you.

739
00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:01.916
It's fine.

740
00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.458
I'm used to being benched.

741
00:40:04.875 --> 00:40:05.500
Boss.

742
00:40:05.708 --> 00:40:06.791
how much for this?

743
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.916
Where'd you get this?

744
00:40:09.208 --> 00:40:09.875
None of your business.

745
00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:10.916
Pay her and send her off.

746
00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:15.458
Hey...

747
00:40:15.625 --> 00:40:17.958
Don't stare like they're suspects.

748
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:21.875
Pull over.

749
00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:38.000
Are you really here?

750
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.208
This is your third time

751
00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:40.208
in the same spot

752
00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:41.208
in the same outfit

753
00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:41.875
using the same hand

754
00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:43.666
to drink the same way.

755
00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:44.666
Your water

756
00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:46.083
is stuck at the same amount.

757
00:40:46.666 --> 00:40:48.416
I'm worried I'd need to pee.

758
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:50.000
Dehydration kills you too.

759
00:40:50.416 --> 00:40:51.000
Drink.

760
00:41:22.333 --> 00:41:24.000
There's 10 billion at stake.

761
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.458
Once we get it.

762
00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:27.125
we're set for life.

763
00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:29.000
It's just one last time.

764
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.291
That's what you all think.

765
00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:31.333
isnt it?

766
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.875
Money isn't everything.

767
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:36.833
Freedom is.

768
00:41:37.416 --> 00:41:38.500
Different time.

769
00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:39.958
different game.

770
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.458
If I let you plan

771
00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:49.500
the next mission...

772
00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.333
You know what you're doing?

773
00:42:08.666 --> 00:42:09.541
Simon.

774
00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:11.500
Dad.

775
00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:15.708
Dad.

776
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:16.625
Xiwang

777
00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:19.083
You've grown so much.

778
00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:20.291
Come.

779
00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:20.750
Come on.

780
00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:25.375
Thanks. daddy!

781
00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:28.791
I have to leave for a while.

782
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:29.916
Take good care of your brothers.

783
00:42:34.583 --> 00:42:36.000
I’ll come back for you boys.

784
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.291
Duan stashed 1.5 billion USD worth of crypto.

785
00:42:44.291 --> 00:42:46.708
The server location has been found.

786
00:42:46.708 --> 00:42:48.250
We already have the decryption key.

787
00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.458
but the digital vault is hard to access.

788
00:42:50.875 --> 00:42:52.125
Simon's hiding at the orphanage.

789
00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:53.333
making plans right now

790
00:42:56.708 --> 00:42:58.041
Good place to hide.

791
00:42:58.458 --> 00:42:59.791
It holds a lot of memories.

792
00:43:01.333 --> 00:43:02.416
I know you're all tired.

793
00:43:02.416 --> 00:43:03.625
but stay focused.

794
00:43:17.458 --> 00:43:18.291
Don't want a coffee?

795
00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:19.083
Get a pick-me-up.

796
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.041
Do I look tired to you?

797
00:43:23.583 --> 00:43:25.291
Have you thought about

798
00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:26.375
killing me?

799
00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:30.750
Then you can split my share.

800
00:43:32.833 --> 00:43:34.583
How could we. Godfather?

801
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:37.916
I'm old anyway.

802
00:43:37.916 --> 00:43:39.500
I'll just be in your way.

803
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.166
Am I right?

804
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:47.208
Why'd you say

805
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.625
I'm your ace in the hole?

806
00:43:56.416 --> 00:43:58.208
Are you gaslighting me?

807
00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:00.666
Gas what?

808
00:44:01.416 --> 00:44:02.833
If anyone even considers that.

809
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:04.000
I'll kill him.

810
00:44:05.083 --> 00:44:06.416
The knife was already in your hand.

811
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:08.958
You think I didn't see that?

812
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.333
Am I not good enough?

813
00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:14.458
You think I need special treatment. too?

814
00:44:14.458 --> 00:44:15.208
No.

815
00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:16.207
You're fine.

816
00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:19.041
You don't need special treatment.

817
00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.083
When the knife's in your hand...

818
00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:25.666
Don't blink.

819
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:29.125
Be forceful.

820
00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:36.625
or it wouldn't be a clean shave.

821
00:44:39.791 --> 00:44:41.583
Then why is everyone on the field

822
00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:44.041
and I'm sitting here. getting you coffee?

823
00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:45.625
You just really want to...

824
00:44:45.625 --> 00:44:46.208
Yes.

825
00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.083
I really want to.

826
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.916
But I need you here right now.

827
00:45:01.625 --> 00:45:03.458
Be my surveillance partner.

828
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.708
That's an order.

829
00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:13.125
Yes. sir.

830
00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:17.875
Brother.

831
00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:20.458
if Xin hadn't held the old man back.

832
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:21.916
he would've stabbed me.

833
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.541
He really meant to kill me.

834
00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:33.333
Is it really that good?

835
00:45:33.583 --> 00:45:35.041
It's just luncheon meat and egg noodles.

836
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.416
Yours is much better than the diners'.

837
00:45:39.833 --> 00:45:41.833
When I was your age.

838
00:45:41.833 --> 00:45:43.541
all I thought about was

839
00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:45.708
how to stay alive on the battlefield.

840
00:45:48.916 --> 00:45:52.541
I envy that you boys can dream of anything

841
00:45:53.541 --> 00:45:54.708
and dare to dream anything.

842
00:45:55.666 --> 00:45:56.666
All I want

843
00:45:56.666 --> 00:45:58.291
is a life in peace

844
00:45:58.291 --> 00:45:59.583
with all my brothers together.

845
00:46:00.083 --> 00:46:01.375
Not scattered. like now.

846
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:03.916
All these years.

847
00:46:04.291 --> 00:46:05.708
in order to look after me.

848
00:46:05.708 --> 00:46:08.833
you sacrificed spending time with your brothers.

849
00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:11.875
Since the day we met.

850
00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:13.000
you’ve been protecting me.

851
00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:16.000
When all those cops were after me.

852
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:16.958
I couldn't believe

853
00:46:18.291 --> 00:46:20.375
a little beggar like you

854
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.083
would save me.

855
00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:25.958
Then you risked your life

856
00:46:25.958 --> 00:46:27.333
to keep the bankrupt orphanage alive.

857
00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:28.500
Without you.

858
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.250
we’d have starved to death.

859
00:46:36.833 --> 00:46:38.333
Eat mine. too.

860
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.791
Out of all the kids.

861
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:46.833
you’re the one I care about the most.

862
00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:49.958
Because you’re just like me.

863
00:46:51.666 --> 00:46:52.583
Simon is more like you.

864
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:56.875
If that is so...

865
00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:59.208
He could be very dangerous.

866
00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:08.208
Eggy and Tofu.

867
00:47:08.208 --> 00:47:09.166
your date's over.

868
00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:10.375
Get changed and get to Point E.

869
00:47:12.083 --> 00:47:12.666
Pudding.

870
00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:13.958
Change.

871
00:47:13.958 --> 00:47:14.666
Point B.

872
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.708
Pork Bun.

873
00:47:18.708 --> 00:47:19.416
Point A.

874
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.583
Something's been feeling off lately.

875
00:47:30.208 --> 00:47:31.375
Stay away

876
00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:33.000
for a while.

877
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.875
I can take care of myself.

878
00:48:08.333 --> 00:48:09.875
Come back to the car.

879
00:48:09.875 --> 00:48:10.791
Call the police.

880
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.500
I am the police.

881
00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:18.750
Help.

882
00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:20.708
Leave them alone.

883
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:21.583
Get lost.

884
00:48:23.125 --> 00:48:26.708
You're pretty cute. little missy.

885
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:43.791
Who are you?

886
00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:54.291
Go.

887
00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:04.541
Let's go.

888
00:49:09.458 --> 00:49:10.083
Drive.

889
00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:16.000
Systems off.

890
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:22.416
Do you know you're on a mission?

891
00:49:25.958 --> 00:49:27.458
Protecting civilians is a cop’s mission.

892
00:49:27.458 --> 00:49:28.500
At the right place

893
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.208
and the right time.

894
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.040
You're on an active mission.

895
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.833
What's the mission?

896
00:49:32.833 --> 00:49:34.541
Operation Dinner for Officer Wong?

897
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.958
Sorry. I failed the mission.

898
00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:38.458
Listen carefully.

899
00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:40.458
You are on a covert surveillance mission.

900
00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:42.916
You cannot blow your cover. no matter what.

901
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.708
I didn't blow shit.

902
00:49:43.708 --> 00:49:44.583
You reached for your badge.

903
00:49:44.583 --> 00:49:45.833
If the Shadow saw that. it’s all over.

904
00:49:45.833 --> 00:49:47.416
And where is he?

905
00:49:48.583 --> 00:49:49.750
We’ve been wandering for weeks.

906
00:49:50.166 --> 00:49:51.416
It's time we actually do some real work.

907
00:49:51.416 --> 00:49:52.541
This is real work.

908
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:02.833
It's only been two weeks.

909
00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:06.291
Do you know how long our longest mission was?

910
00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:08.541
Eight months.

911
00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:13.625
I know.

912
00:50:16.082 --> 00:50:16.708
Eight months.

913
00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:18.958
Then what?

914
00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:22.333
What happened?

915
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.625
My father died because of you.

916
00:50:24.625 --> 00:50:25.708
The drug dealer escaped.

917
00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:28.375
Do you know I hadn't seen him

918
00:50:28.375 --> 00:50:30.375
for over a year before he died?!

919
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.041
It was all my fault.

920
00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:51.458
I...

921
00:50:53.916 --> 00:50:55.458
You know what I did that day?

922
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:58.083
I did what you did.

923
00:51:01.083 --> 00:51:02.916
What a cute kid.

924
00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:05.041
I have bubbles right here.

925
00:51:06.416 --> 00:51:07.250
Do you like bubbles?

926
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.791
Yes

927
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.666
Let's play in the van. shall we?

928
00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.166
We've got lots of toys inside.

929
00:51:11.166 --> 00:51:11.958
Shall we?

930
00:51:23.625 --> 00:51:24.041
What?

931
00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.291
-Put the kid down. -Get lost.

932
00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:26.416
Who are you?

933
00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:28.000
Put the kid down.

934
00:51:28.333 --> 00:51:28.916
Police.

935
00:51:30.666 --> 00:51:31.250
Don't move.

936
00:51:32.333 --> 00:51:33.375
So what?

937
00:51:33.375 --> 00:51:34.166
Don't you move.

938
00:51:34.583 --> 00:51:36.291
Let’s see your badge.

939
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.250
Police.

940
00:52:06.166 --> 00:52:07.500
My recklessness

941
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.833
got your father killed.

942
00:52:16.291 --> 00:52:17.916
But you saved that child.

943
00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:19.958
I didn't.

944
00:52:21.833 --> 00:52:23.750
The traffickers escaped in the chaos.

945
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.875
Did they ever find the child?

946
00:52:32.958 --> 00:52:33.708
I don't know.

947
00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:47.916
As police officers.

948
00:52:47.916 --> 00:52:50.791
we have to learn to stay rational.

949
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:51.875
Follow discipline.

950
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:53.833
Execute orders.

951
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:57.583
Better to have regrets

952
00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:01.583
than to make mistakes.

953
00:53:03.875 --> 00:53:05.333
Because that's our duty.

954
00:53:56.958 --> 00:53:57.875
Possible sighting of the Shadow.

955
00:53:57.875 --> 00:53:59.041
Mercado Rua de Oeste.

956

Grey pants.

958
00:54:01.375 --> 00:54:02.041
Wearing a brown beret.

959
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:03.083
Could be wearing glasses.

960
00:54:03.666 --> 00:54:05.125
Everyone. change outfits.

961
00:54:05.125 --> 00:54:05.916
Prepare to ID him.

962
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.791
All units. be advised.

963
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:13.125
Shadow spotted.

964
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:14.125
Monitoring the market.

965
00:54:14.833 --> 00:54:16.416
Adorable Unit en route.

966
00:54:16.625 --> 00:54:18.500

Pudding. Pork Bun. north.

970
00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:24.458
The Shadow may have seen you before.

971
00:54:24.458 --> 00:54:26.583
A pro like him doesn't forget.

972
00:54:26.583 --> 00:54:28.041
He'll be vigilant the second time

973
00:54:28.041 --> 00:54:29.208
and get suspicious.

974
00:54:29.208 --> 00:54:30.625
Maintain a two-unit distance.

975
00:54:31.916 --> 00:54:32.625
Piggy.

976
00:54:36.208 --> 00:54:38.083
ID him up close.

977
00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:40.458
He hasn't seen your face.

978
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.750
Small suggestion for ground surveillance.

979
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.125
You should use your most inconspicuous officers.

980
00:54:46.125 --> 00:54:48.208
Preferably ones suspects haven't seen before.

981
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:54.583
Go.

982
00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:14.250
Slow down.

983
00:55:14.791 --> 00:55:16.250
Maintain distance.

984
00:55:19.166 --> 00:55:20.583
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

985
00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:22.291
Adorable Unit's on site.

986
00:55:22.958 --> 00:55:23.791
Alpaca.

987
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:25.416
Approach the fruit stall on the west.

988
00:55:30.166 --> 00:55:31.041
Walk slowly.

989
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:32.165
Don't rush.

990
00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:35.458
Our mission is to ID the target.

991
00:55:35.458 --> 00:55:37.208
Don't spook the Shadow.

992
00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:41.333
Relax. Be natural.

993
00:55:42.291 --> 00:55:43.250
He's a pro.

994
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.583
No room for negligence.

995
00:55:48.791 --> 00:55:49.875
Potsticker. east exit.

996
00:55:49.875 --> 00:55:50.625
Copy.

997
00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:52.375
Pork Bun. stand by at the footbridge.

998
00:55:52.375 --> 00:55:53.125
Copy.

999
00:55:58.541 --> 00:55:59.791
Pudding. don't get too close.

1000
00:56:00.208 --> 00:56:00.958
Walk away.

1001
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:02.833
Alpaca.

1002
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:04.541
Can you ID him?

1003
00:56:06.208 --> 00:56:07.250
Negative.

1004
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.375
Can't see his face.

1005
00:56:08.375 --> 00:56:09.291
Can't confirm.

1006
00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:17.375
We may be able to see his face.

1007
00:56:23.916 --> 00:56:26.083
Eggy. Shadow might've seen you at Aoxing.

1008
00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:27.791
Don’t turn.

1009
00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:39.291
Tofu. well done.

1010
00:56:39.291 --> 00:56:40.666
Piggy. it's on you.

1011
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.541
Be careful.

1012
00:56:53.208 --> 00:56:54.916
I'll get closer to him.

1013
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:01.791
Piggy. you might get blown.

1014
00:57:01.791 --> 00:57:03.125
I know. I have an idea.

1015
00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:38.541
It’s him.

1016
00:57:38.916 --> 00:57:39.583
Confirmed.

1017
00:57:40.625 --> 00:57:41.875
Hand down.

1018
00:57:50.708 --> 00:57:51.666
Don't move the camera.

1019
00:58:08.458 --> 00:58:10.208
All units. positive ID on the Shadow.

1020
00:58:11.125 --> 00:58:12.500
Adorable Unit. change and stand by.

1021
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.416
Maintain cover.

1022
00:58:14.166 --> 00:58:15.666
Everyone. good job.

1023
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.833
Target confirmed.

1024
00:58:20.833 --> 00:58:24.041
All units. do not breach 3 blocks perimeter.

1025
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:24.875
I repeat.

1026
00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:26.708
Do not approach target area.

1027
00:58:26.708 --> 00:58:28.666
Be advised. no siren.

1028
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.083
The target has entered a blind spot.

1029
00:58:37.958 --> 00:58:39.500
Lucky. you're up.

1030
00:58:40.666 --> 00:58:41.958
Potsticker. tail him.

1031
00:58:43.375 --> 00:58:44.625
Not too close.

1032
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.458
The bastard won't get away.

1033
00:58:50.125 --> 00:58:52.000
Shadow's headed to Changning Apartments.

1034
00:58:53.916 --> 00:58:55.000
The blocks are connected inside.

1035
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.041
There are hundreds of flats.

1036
00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:57.666
If we don't get his flat number.

1037
00:58:57.666 --> 00:58:58.958
there won't be a next time.

1038
00:59:12.583 --> 00:59:14.500
The Shadow's in Block C. Unit 1.

1039
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.583
No camera inside the building.

1040
00:59:15.583 --> 00:59:17.041
We'll lose him in an elevator.

1041
00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:18.166
Pull over.

1042
00:59:18.166 --> 00:59:18.708
Adorables.

1043
00:59:18.708 --> 00:59:19.541
They are too far away.

1044
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:20.416
Adorable unit. come in.

1045
00:59:20.416 --> 00:59:22.125
I'm too far away to catch up.

1046
00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.291
Potsticker cannot follow.

1047
00:59:23.291 --> 00:59:24.916
Eggy cannot follow.

1048
00:59:24.916 --> 00:59:25.625
I’ll go.

1049
00:59:25.625 --> 00:59:26.625
Piggy can follow.

1050
00:59:30.125 --> 00:59:30.875
I'm in.

1051
01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:49.500
Top floor.

1052
01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:06.875
What are you doing?

1053
01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:07.958
Will you listen to me or not?

1054
01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:09.166
What?

1055
01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.208
Dating behind my back.

1056
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.750
My friend caught you. you know.

1057
01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:18.958
What floor?

1058
01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:21.625
I forgot something.

1059
01:01:21.916 --> 01:01:22.750
You two go ahead.

1060
01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:42.000
Getting all dolled up now?

1061
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.458
I knew you'd lose your earrings

1062
01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:45.208
with those big earphones on.

1063
01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.416
Com'on. leave me alone.

1064
01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:49.541
See this?

1065
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.916
They stop listening when they grow up.

1066
01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.958
All they do is go against their parents.

1067
01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:58.875
They're grown-ups with minds of their own.

1068
01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:01.625
What can a father do?

1069
01:02:02.333 --> 01:02:03.583
You're terribly open-minded.

1070
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.416
Otherwise. they’ll start

1071
01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:07.041
hiding things from you.

1072
01:02:14.583 --> 01:02:17.500
Your Aunt Kandam said that guy looks like an alpaca.

1073
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.666
Is that why you’re hiding him from me?

1074
01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:19.875
Who?

1075
01:02:20.916 --> 01:02:21.916
The guy you’re dating.

1076
01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:24.291
What's wrong with looking like a alpaca?

1077
01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:25.583
Alpacas are cute.

1078
01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.041
He’s actually really handsome. okay?

1079
01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:30.958
That's been sitting for days.

1080
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:31.541
Why'd you buy it?

1081
01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:32.958
Got a camera signal.

1082
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.333
It's all the same in the stomach.

1083
01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:36.166
Here.

1084
01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:37.166
Want one?

1085
01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:43.791
Check his background.

1086
01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:44.291
Roger that.

1087
01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:45.833
Shadow's face acquired.

1088
01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:46.750
Caught on camera.

1089
01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:49.458
How can you just spit that out?

1090
01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:51.666
The janitors will clean it up.

1091
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:53.333
Look. it's fine.

1092
01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:56.375
I hope you’ll marry into

1093
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.375
a rich family someday.

1094
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.000
Ever seen a rich father-in-law

1095
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.583
behave this uncivilized?

1096
01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:05.958
One bad apple can't drag a family down.

1097
01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:07.625
Will you be better to yourself?

1098
01:03:07.625 --> 01:03:09.083
Buy some fresh fruits.

1099
01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:11.583
I'm saving up for you.

1100
01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:12.666
Not again.

1101
01:03:16.916 --> 01:03:17.583
Bye.

1102
01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:28.750
So who's courting who now?

1103
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.750
None of your business.

1104
01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:31.666
You have such a bad temper.

1105
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.416
What does he see in you?

1106
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.000
Keep walking.

1107
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.666
Keep walking.

1108
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.791
I have a great temper.

1109
01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:40.875
Now what?

1110
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.166
Follow me.

1111
01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:43.375
What's his zodiac?

1112
01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:44.666
What's it to you?

1113
01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:46.791
To see if he is compatiable with me.

1114
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:48.666
You're not serious.

1115
01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:49.500
Get the package.

1116
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.166
I'm amazed how nosy you can be.

1117
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.083
You buy so much stuff.

1118
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:09.750
Police.

1119
01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:11.916
Close the door.

1120
01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:13.541
We need this flat. please move out.

1121
01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:14.458
Police business.

1122
01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:20.208
Eighth floor.

1123
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.666
802. got it.

1124
01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.666
Shadow lives in Channing apartment.

1125
01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:46.708
C block. unit 1. 802. Solid intel.

1126
01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:17.875
Pick it up.

1127
01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:38.125
What's that sound?

1128
01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.541
Popping bubble wrap?

1129
01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:40.666
Is it OCD?

1130
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.625
It's unsolvable.

1131
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.041
No wonder it's torn.

1132
01:06:00.083 --> 01:06:01.083
Weird.

1133
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.875
They’re all wrong.

1134
01:06:28.666 --> 01:06:30.583
In the past. the Shadow would always

1135
01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:32.750
disappear after a job

1136
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:34.625
and remains silent for a while.

1137
01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:35.750
He's a man of principle.

1138
01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.500
This time. he broke his own protocol.

1139
01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:40.125
What's happening?

1140
01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:42.416
If I’m not mistaken.

1141
01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.041
my guess is

1142
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:46.083
we've spooked him.

1143
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.333
Whatever he wants to play.

1144
01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:49.958
we'll play with him.

1145
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.625
Finally stopped buying rotten apples?

1146
01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:01.250
What a coincidence.

1147
01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:05.458
How much?

1148
01:07:06.666 --> 01:07:07.291
$3.70.

1149
01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:09.000
Prices have gone up.

1150
01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:10.458
It's all right.

1151
01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:11.500
Twenty cents.

1152
01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:13.791
Everything's more expensive now.

1153
01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:14.416
This one.

1154
01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:15.000
Thanks.

1155
01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.083
That stall is cheaper.

1156
01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:22.416
Are you joking? They're terrible.

1157
01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:23.166
Nothing fresh.

1158
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.791
I meant

1159
01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:28.250
the fish stall behind it.

1160
01:07:28.666 --> 01:07:29.166
It's cheap.

1161
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:30.625
You're right.

1162
01:07:31.875 --> 01:07:32.791
Not to mention

1163
01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:34.416
the owner's dad is a good man.

1164
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:35.750
Ten dollars.

1165
01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:37.750
It's unfortunate

1166
01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:40.083
how sudden he passed.

1167
01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:40.916
Heart attack.

1168
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:42.708
Asthma.

1169
01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:47.791
Your daughter’s all grown up.

1170
01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:49.000
Doesn’t she want to move out?

1171
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.166
Her mom left me because of my gambling.

1172
01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:53.333
After her mom

1173
01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:54.500
died from illness.

1174
01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:56.833
she moved in with me.

1175
01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.166
Thanks.

1176
01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:02.166
What are you doing?

1177
01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:03.791
Planning to work in a casino?

1178
01:08:03.791 --> 01:08:05.083
Selling fish doesn't pay the bills

1179
01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:05.833
Give me a grass carp.

1180
01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:09.833
See these calluses?

1181
01:08:10.958 --> 01:08:13.083
Got them from playing cards when I was young.

1182
01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:14.541
I wanted to be a God of Gamblers.

1183
01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:15.958
I didn't know

1184
01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.332
that was only in the movies.

1185
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.582
I thought

1186
01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:22.125
you got callus from holding guns.

1187
01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:23.500
Never held a gun.

1188
01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.707
Held a chef's knife for 10 years. though.

1189
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.082
Let's find a time.

1190
01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:28.957
I'll cook a few dishes.

1191
01:08:29.416 --> 01:08:30.916
Come over

1192
01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:31.832
and have a drink.

1193
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.166
That's funny.

1194
01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:36.957
I was a chef when I was abroad.

1195
01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:38.457
My teacher was from Hangzhou.

1196
01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:40.207
I make a mean West Lake vinegar fish.

1197
01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:43.375
How about today?

1198
01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:46.582
Great.

1199
01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.207
I happen to have a bottle of Chilean wine

1200
01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:50.832
that goes with that dish.

1201
01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:53.332
You bring the wine. I'll cook.

1202
01:08:57.957 --> 01:08:58.666
Come in.

1203
01:08:59.041 --> 01:08:59.832
Have a seat.

1204
01:09:00.457 --> 01:09:01.375
I'll put this into the fridge.

1205
01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:10.791
What was he doing?

1206
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:11.916
Checking for dust.

1207
01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:13.291
To see if they just moved in.

1208
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:18.416
You're not getting away.

1209
01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:20.332
You may be the guest.

1210
01:09:20.332 --> 01:09:21.791
but you're not spared from kitchen duty.

1211
01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:23.291
Show us what you've got.

1212
01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:25.582
I can't wait.

1213
01:09:27.707 --> 01:09:29.082
How long were you a chef for?

1214
01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:30.750
Over ten years.

1215
01:09:32.415 --> 01:09:33.582
And that's the knife you use?

1216
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.666
You know your knives.

1217
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:56.000
I just like

1218
01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:57.875
doing things the right way.

1219
01:10:00.041 --> 01:10:00.833
Got any kids?

1220
01:10:02.333 --> 01:10:03.625
I'm on my own.

1221
01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:04.750
A lonely old man.

1222
01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:07.416
Here's a home-cooked meal.

1223
01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.416
Your girl seems like a smart kid.

1224
01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:15.500
That scar on her forehead...

1225
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.416
How'd she get it?

1226
01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:27.125
Put that phone away.

1227
01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:28.125
Talk with our guest instead.

1228
01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:28.750
Okay.

1229
01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.583
I need the bathroom.

1230
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.333
If I had a child.

1231
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:41.250
I'd ban phones from the dinner table. too.

1232
01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.166
Start coloning.

1233
01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:48.541
What are you studying?

1234
01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:49.083
Nursing.

1235
01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.416
You plan to be a nurse after graduation?

1236
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.333
Maybe in a retirement home.

1237
01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:57.583
What a kind heart.

1238
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:02.625
How'd you get that scar?

1239
01:11:02.875 --> 01:11:03.458
This one?

1240
01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:08.166
Fifth grade.

1241
01:11:08.791 --> 01:11:10.583
Got into a fight with some girls.

1242
01:11:11.666 --> 01:11:13.125
Why were you fighting?

1243
01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.458
A classmate was being bullied.

1244
01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:15.583
Couldn't stand idly by.

1245
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:18.333
But I never told anyone that until now.

1246
01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:22.541
Does your dad know?

1247
01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:24.041
He couldn’t possibly know.

1248
01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:26.833
That’s odd.

1249
01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:28.708
What’s up?

1250
01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:32.625
How'd she get that scar again?

1251
01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:35.750
She got into a fight in fifth grade.

1252
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:36.583
One against five.

1253
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.333
Someone bashed her with a bottle.

1254
01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:44.041
I never told anyone.

1255
01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:46.833
Not even my mom.

1256
01:11:47.958 --> 01:11:49.083
You didn’t tell her because

1257
01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.250
you didn't want her to worry.

1258
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:51.708
Even your teacher

1259
01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.083
thought you hit a door.

1260
01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.041
Right?

1261
01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:58.541
How'd you know. then?

1262
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.041
After our divorce.

1263
01:12:07.166 --> 01:12:08.166
my debts

1264
01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.125
made me some enemies.

1265
01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:13.125
I was worried they'd hurt you.

1266
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:17.708
The truth is...

1267
01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:20.708
I was always nearby.

1268
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.458
See?

1269
01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:34.333
That's a dad.

1270
01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:42.416
Then why didn’t you help me?

1271
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.166
Help you?

1272
01:12:44.166 --> 01:12:45.958
Remember what you did to those girls?

1273
01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:47.000
It's horrifying.

1274
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.583
I was too scared to step in.

1275
01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:50.625
Give me some credit.

1276
01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:51.708
I was standing up for someone.

1277
01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:52.208
You were...

1278
01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:52.958
What?

1279
01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:53.958
You were committing murder.

1280
01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:55.166
Com'on now.

1281
01:12:56.416 --> 01:12:58.083
You're embarrassing me.

1282
01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:18.250
How'd it go?

1283
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:22.791
Go on.

1284
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:28.166
Thank you.

1285
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.166
What for?

1286
01:13:32.415 --> 01:13:33.791
For protecting us.

1287
01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:42.875
Some things

1288
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.791
can never be mended.

1289
01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:50.291
The only thing I could do for your father

1290
01:13:52.416 --> 01:13:53.541
was to watch over you.

1291
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.125
I know you've been worrying about me.

1292
01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:00.791
You want to protect me.

1293
01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:05.375
But I’ve grown up.

1294
01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:08.458
I'll be okay.

1295
01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:14.791
You're okay.

1296
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:18.458
Big Brother...

1297
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:19.750
If you fail.

1298
01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:21.166
what happens next

1299
01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.250
will be my call.

1300
01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.708
If we do it your way.

1301
01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:26.208
there's no turning back for us.

1302
01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:28.000
I just want to

1303
01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:30.291
do things the right way.

1304
01:14:37.166 --> 01:14:38.125
They have anti-tracking.

1305
01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:39.333
Must be that hacker.

1306
01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:40.000
Stand down.

1307
01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:45.125
Have you checked their background?

1308
01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:48.916
I have.

1309
01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:53.875
Guoguo?

1310
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:54.750
Forgot something?

1311
01:15:05.541 --> 01:15:06.708
Nothing to worry about.

1312
01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:09.083
Maybe I did worry too much.

1313
01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:17.083
Did you

1314
01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:18.208
sense something's off?

1315
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:41.333
I realize that

1316
01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:43.125
you're a big boy now.

1317
01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:45.166
It really is time to let go.

1318
01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:23.625
Let's follow through with your plan.

1319
01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:24.708
Got it.

1320
01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:26.125
You know what you're doing?

1321
01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:32.791
I do.

1322
01:17:22.833 --> 01:17:24.458
That girl isn't Guoguo.

1323
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:25.541
What do you mean?

1324
01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:27.333
There’s something wrong with this feed.

1325
01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:28.875
That’s definitely not Qiuguo.

1326
01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:34.916
Send backup to Wong.

1327
01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:35.708
He's in danger.

1328
01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:38.041
Cops are coming. leave.

1329
01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:11.166
I failed.

1330
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:12.875
I'll find another way.

1331
01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:36.250
Hey.

1332
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:37.833
Has the Shadow moved?

1333
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.375
Nope. all quiet.

1334
01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.666
You had your chance. Xiwang.

1335
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:54.500
Those boys

1336
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.333
didn’t even tell the Shadow

1337
01:18:56.333 --> 01:18:57.375
that he’s being watched.

1338
01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:02.208
They know we'd use the Shadow to track them.

1339
01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.333
so we wouldn't touch him.

1340
01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.458
Killing me and creating chaos

1341
01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:14.125
would've created an opening to break The Shadow out.

1342
01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:15.916
After failing this time.

1343
01:19:15.916 --> 01:19:17.416
they'll look for another chance.

1344
01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:24.125
Their chance is our opportunity. too.

1345
01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:25.833
We have to nail this gang of thieves

1346
01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:26.833
once for all.

1347
01:19:51.666 --> 01:19:52.541
Shadow's on the move.

1348
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.500
Surveillance team. spread out.

1349
01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:17.125
Madam. that's the same taxi as the one at Aoxing.

1350
01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:19.125
Sending photo to the surveillance team now.

1351
01:20:19.125 --> 01:20:20.250
We’re standing by.

1352
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.541
When the suspects' location is locked.

1353
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:22.583
we're ready to move in.

1354
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.708
Target vehicle is approaching our HQ.

1355
01:20:29.708 --> 01:20:31.541
Are they turning themselves in?

1356
01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.833
Doesn’t look like it.

1357
01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:41.833
Wait.

1358
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:44.208
Show me that cabinet again.

1359
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.333
Why is that still there?

1360
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.708
It's unsolvable.

1361
01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:58.416
They're all wrong.

1362
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.041
Get closer. show me again.

1363
01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:12.750
What’s that?

1364
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.708
It seems Wong's van has been hit.

1365
01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:42.958
Officer Wong?

1366
01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:44.375
Wong. can you hear me?

1367
01:21:44.791 --> 01:21:45.875
Wong. come in if you hear me.

1368
01:21:46.833 --> 01:21:47.458
Officer Wong?

1369
01:21:47.833 --> 01:21:48.416
Officer Wong?

1370
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:49.583
Officer Wong?

1371
01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:50.208
Guoguo.

1372
01:21:50.541 --> 01:21:51.000
Their...

1373
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.416
Their vehicles broke in.

1374
01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:53.791
Whose vehicles?

1375
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.166
HQ is under attack?

1376
01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:07.333
Madam. what's going on?

1377
01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:16.332
Du Ping.

1378
01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:17.416
ready the mobile command unit.

1379
01:22:17.416 --> 01:22:17.750
Yes. ma'am.

1380
01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:19.083
Surveillance. stay focused.

1381
01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.083
Eyes on target.

1382
01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:21.166
Watch the Shadow's every move.

1383
01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:30.083
Officer Wong.

1384
01:22:33.958 --> 01:22:35.500
Someone's still alive.

1385
01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:36.500
Terminate.

1386
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:15.416
The phone...

1387
01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.041
It's smashed.

1388
01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:18.666
The key to the puzzle isn't the numbers.

1389
01:23:18.666 --> 01:23:19.416
it’s the positions.

1390
01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:20.583
They’re using Braille.

1391
01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:22.083
The bubble wrap is also Braille.

1392
01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:24.291
Get Intelligence to decipher the messages.

1393
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:26.333
Find out what they're up to.

1394
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.333
Find a phone. I'll hold them back.

1395
01:23:34.333 --> 01:23:34.916
Go.

1396
01:23:43.666 --> 01:23:44.583
What's this place?

1397
01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:46.833
Looks like an abandoned orphanage.

1398
01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:48.125
No other suspect in sight.

1399
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.208
Use thermal to follow Shadow.

1400
01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:53.500
I need eyes on the inside.

1401
01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:06.458
Captain.

1402
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:07.375
In the orphanage!

1403
01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:13.125
HQ.

1404
01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:13.708
This is Alpaca.

1405
01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:14.666
Can anyone hear me?

1406
01:24:15.916 --> 01:24:16.708
Command central?

1407
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:18.291
We've lost all comms.

1408
01:24:18.291 --> 01:24:19.083
Command central?

1409
01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.333
Brothers. get to work.

1410
01:25:18.625 --> 01:25:20.625
Chop him up.

1411
01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:55.166
Do you know how many cops came after me?

1412
01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:56.875
Two hundred.

1413
01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:58.791
If I took off.

1414
01:25:59.125 --> 01:26:00.375
I’d be dead for sure.

1415
01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:02.125
So what did you do?

1416
01:26:02.916 --> 01:26:04.875
The idiot who got nailed

1417
01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:06.125
became bait.

1418
01:26:07.875 --> 01:26:09.791
Then I took out the biggest threat

1419
01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:11.250
in the Police Force.

1420
01:26:12.833 --> 01:26:15.916
That took out the cops' eyes.

1421
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.333
Then I took out the idiot.

1422
01:26:23.666 --> 01:26:25.583
cutting off the cops' ears. too.

1423
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.166
I've become the idiot in my boys' eyes.

1424
01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.208
However...

1425
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.500
first you need to be sure to have

1426
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:40.583
what it takes.

1427
01:26:42.958 --> 01:26:43.958
You're a big boy now.

1428
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.416
You know what you're doing?

1429
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:51.166
Who do you think I am?

1430
01:26:51.666 --> 01:26:52.625
Kill him.

1431
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:08.208
Cell signal's jammed.

1432
01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:10.041
Find a sat phone to call for backup.

1433
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:11.208
We'll go buy some time.

1434
01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.750
That's him.

1435
01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:44.250
Gotta kill him to get paid.

1436
01:28:13.916 --> 01:28:15.291
The Shadow sends messages via Braille.

1437
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.000
The bubble wrap and sudoku are all Braille.

1438
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:17.583
Guoguo.

1439
01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:18.750
Give that intel to Madam Wang.

1440
01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:23.625
Guoguo.

1441
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:11.125
How did the cops arrive so quickly?

1442
01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:37.416
Madam. we've got this.

1443
01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:23.625
Godfather.

1444
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:29.041
I failed.

1445
01:30:29.416 --> 01:30:30.375
I'll find another way.

1446
01:30:30.375 --> 01:30:32.083
You had your chance. Xiwang.

1447
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.750
If we're the ones nailed by the police.

1448
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:36.708
what would the old man do?

1449
01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:38.833
This is no one's fault.

1450
01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:39.541
It's just

1451
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.750
carelessness and bad luck.

1452
01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.250
Simon’s idea?

1453
01:30:45.583 --> 01:30:46.291
Mine.

1454
01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:00.583
Still think you're not like me?

1455
01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:05.958
Xiwang.

1456
01:31:06.083 --> 01:31:07.041
what are you doing?

1457
01:31:07.041 --> 01:31:08.083
You don’t understand

1458
01:31:08.541 --> 01:31:09.791
how dangerous this man is.

1459
01:31:19.625 --> 01:31:20.541
Leave.

1460
01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:21.750
This isn't part of the plan.

1461
01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:28.875
The old man has to die here

1462
01:31:28.875 --> 01:31:29.541
for you to be safe.

1463
01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:30.291
Leave.

1464
01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:31.916
This isn't part of the plan.

1465
01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:37.375
This was always my plan.

1466
01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:43.375
I'm helping you for the last time.

1467
01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:46.625
You want to die?

1468
01:31:46.625 --> 01:31:47.708
Simon's my little brother.

1469
01:31:48.458 --> 01:31:49.166
If he screws up...

1470
01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:50.750
It's my job to fix it.

1471
01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:51.791
I have no choice.

1472
01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:57.291
Then I'll send you on your way.

1473
01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:00.958
Godfather.

1474
01:32:02.916 --> 01:32:03.875
Your life

1475
01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:06.250
ends here too.

1476
01:33:25.875 --> 01:33:27.041
Get ready.

1477
01:34:47.125 --> 01:34:48.125
He’s a wolf.

1478
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:50.416
We’re wolf pups.

1479
01:34:53.416 --> 01:34:54.416
He's our father.

1480
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.708
In my next life.

1481
01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:04.500
I hope I'll be your real son.

1482
01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:10.375
Take care of them.

1483
01:36:10.375 --> 01:36:12.083
Look after their families.

1484
01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:14.791
Yes. sir.

1485
01:36:31.125 --> 01:36:32.458
Kandam. it's me.

1486
01:36:35.333 --> 01:36:35.833
Gundam.

1487
01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:36.500
Like the robot.

1488
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.416
What do we know?

1489
01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:40.041
I just contacted Captain Wu.

1490
01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:41.291
A big explosion at the orphanage.

1491
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:42.041
The Shadow?

1492
01:36:42.041 --> 01:36:42.958
Not sure.

1493
01:36:43.166 --> 01:36:44.666
But we've ID'd the assailants.

1494
01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:45.583
On the surface.

1495
01:36:45.583 --> 01:36:47.166
they're private security

1496
01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:49.208
for VIP clients at casinos.

1497
01:36:49.208 --> 01:36:50.583
But they also moonlight as mercenaries.

1498
01:36:50.583 --> 01:36:52.416
taking high-risk jobs on the dark web.

1499
01:36:52.791 --> 01:36:54.416
Alpaca contacted Evidence

1500
01:36:54.416 --> 01:36:55.541
after receiving Piggy's message.

1501
01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:57.333
We'll have the results soon. thanks to him.

1502
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.125
It's Gordon D.

1503
01:37:04.458 --> 01:37:06.250
Why is Duan's HK$10 billion

1504
01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:07.833
in the police station's server?

1505
01:37:07.833 --> 01:37:09.125
Without the decryption keys.

1506
01:37:09.125 --> 01:37:11.500
the loot can only be kept as digital evidence.

1507
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.750
The only way to access the cold wallet

1508
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:13.583
is by using its digital key.

1509
01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:14.791
enabling the 12-word passphrase

1510
01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:17.333
to be inputted with nanosecond precision.

1511
01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:19.416
They were here.

1512
01:37:22.708 --> 01:37:23.458
Madam.

1513
01:37:23.458 --> 01:37:24.458
leave this to us.

1514
01:37:24.625 --> 01:37:25.500
Be careful.

1515
01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:29.791
We have a report of a robbery.

1516
01:37:29.791 --> 01:37:30.791
Suspects just left.

1517
01:37:30.791 --> 01:37:32.750
Four males. all in early 20s.

1518
01:37:34.458 --> 01:37:36.166
It was those SWAT guys just now.

1519
01:37:36.625 --> 01:37:37.833
The perps cut the power to

1520
01:37:37.833 --> 01:37:40.083
stop us from shutting the hacker out remotely.

1521
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.333
They need a local network

1522
01:37:42.333 --> 01:37:43.958
within range to access the servers.

1523
01:37:44.208 --> 01:37:45.291
What does that mean?

1524
01:37:45.958 --> 01:37:47.416
The hacker was just here.

1525
01:37:57.875 --> 01:37:58.958
We were wrong.

1526
01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.208
What did we do wrong?

1527
01:38:02.208 --> 01:38:04.041
The old man got himself caught.

1528
01:38:05.291 --> 01:38:06.666
Like an idiot.

1529
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:09.291
He was outsmarted by the cops.

1530
01:38:12.166 --> 01:38:14.083
That cop’s house was too clean.

1531
01:38:14.083 --> 01:38:15.125
It didn't even have a router.

1532
01:38:15.125 --> 01:38:16.082
It was absurd.

1533
01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:18.833
No way the old man didn't notice.

1534
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.708
But he still played along.

1535
01:38:22.666 --> 01:38:24.291
What are you trying to say?

1536
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:27.875
I think

1537
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:30.875
he was actually throwing

1538
01:38:30.875 --> 01:38:31.875
the cops off our trail.

1539
01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:35.041
The 'Ghost Car' trap?

1540
01:38:39.208 --> 01:38:40.625
He's not that noble.

1541
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:43.416
He's the most cunning.

1542
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:45.666
ruthless.

1543
01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:47.166
and...

1544
01:38:53.208 --> 01:38:54.125
He's a dad.

1545
01:38:54.291 --> 01:38:55.291
He's a dad.

1546
01:39:00.375 --> 01:39:01.416
Get a grip.

1547
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:03.250
Get away first.

1548
01:39:03.833 --> 01:39:04.791
Then we'll cry.

1549
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:37.166
We lost a SWAT vehicle at

1550
01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:39.041
the surveillance blind spot on Calcada do Carmo.

1551
01:39:39.041 --> 01:39:40.916
It's likely the thieves will flee tonight.

1552
01:39:40.916 --> 01:39:42.250
Watch every possible exit route

1553
01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:43.583
and all scheduled departures.

1554
01:39:43.583 --> 01:39:44.666
Every route?

1555
01:39:44.666 --> 01:39:45.708
That'll take time.

1556
01:39:45.708 --> 01:39:46.916
We don’t have time.

1557
01:39:47.166 --> 01:39:47.875
What do we do now?

1558
01:39:49.666 --> 01:39:50.666
Activate S.P.A.I.S..

1559
01:39:50.916 --> 01:39:52.750
restore analysis and command authority.

1560
01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.166
Copy.

1561
01:39:54.875 --> 01:39:56.833
Have her study the thieves' past MO

1562
01:39:56.833 --> 01:39:58.625
and predict their next moves.

1563
01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.791
Show her their most recent methods. too.

1564
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:02.250
If possible...

1565
01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:02.750
Madam.

1566
01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:04.250
Spice Girl's got a lead.

1567
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.916
That fast?

1568
01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:10.083
The suspect vehicle disappeared on Calcada do Carmo.

1569
01:40:10.083 --> 01:40:11.041
Within a three-kilometer radius.

1570
01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:13.291
a gray van was caught on cameras.

1571
01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:15.000
There’s a 67% chance

1572
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.541
that the thieves switched to this van.

1573
01:40:16.541 --> 01:40:18.541
There's an 82% chance the thieves are

1574
01:40:18.541 --> 01:40:19.708
headed to the Wynn Palace.

1575
01:40:19.708 --> 01:40:20.250
Wynn?

1576
01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:21.291
The Wynn again?

1577
01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:22.333
I told you to learn.

1578
01:40:22.333 --> 01:40:23.125
not copy old answers.

1579
01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:26.750
Don’t move.

1580
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:27.125
Don’t move.

1581
01:40:27.125 --> 01:40:27.625
Hands on your head.

1582
01:40:27.625 --> 01:40:28.166
Don’t move.

1583
01:40:28.166 --> 01:40:29.958
Don’t move.

1584
01:40:30.916 --> 01:40:31.583
Put down the knife.

1585
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:32.958
Put down the knife.

1586
01:40:32.958 --> 01:40:33.708
Put down the knife.

1587
01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:34.833
- Put it down. -Put down the knife.

1588
01:40:34.833 --> 01:40:35.583
Freeze.

1589
01:40:41.541 --> 01:40:42.333
Ting.

1590
01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:44.583
Ting.

1591
01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:48.083
The Shadow's still alive.

1592
01:40:48.083 --> 01:40:48.916
The Shadow's still alive.

1593
01:40:49.666 --> 01:40:50.291
On your knees.

1594
01:40:50.458 --> 01:40:51.375
Hands on your head.

1595
01:40:51.375 --> 01:40:51.916
On your knees.

1596
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:53.375
Hands on your head.

1597
01:40:53.375 --> 01:40:54.125
On your knees.

1598
01:41:02.375 --> 01:41:03.583
Daddy.

1599
01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:13.458
On your knees.

1600
01:41:13.458 --> 01:41:14.208
Hands on your head.

1601
01:41:14.208 --> 01:41:15.541
On your knees. Hands on your head.

1602
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:16.541
On your knees.

1603
01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:22.458
Wynn Palace.

1604
01:41:25.583 --> 01:41:26.916
Take me there.

1605
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.625
There’s someone you haven’t seen.

1606
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:32.250
I'll point him out.

1607
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.875
Spice Girl found a vehicle

1608
01:41:38.875 --> 01:41:40.583
relevant to a possible exit route

1609
01:41:40.583 --> 01:41:42.000
that leads to suspicious individuals.

1610
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.791
Suspicious in identities?

1611
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:43.375
No.

1612
01:41:43.375 --> 01:41:44.041
In the number of them.

1613
01:41:44.375 --> 01:41:45.333
The Wynn has an art exhibition.

1614
01:41:45.333 --> 01:41:47.625
The paintings are flying back to Paris tonight.

1615
01:41:47.625 --> 01:41:48.666
Six Chinese personnel were added

1616
01:41:48.666 --> 01:41:50.666
to the manifest two days ago.

1617
01:41:50.666 --> 01:41:52.083
And on the night of the last heist.

1618
01:41:52.083 --> 01:41:53.958
Wynn also had art pieces set to leave.

1619
01:41:54.125 --> 01:41:55.625
This Spice Girl's gifted.

1620
01:42:16.416 --> 01:42:17.083
Cops are here.

1621
01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:18.166
That's fast.

1622
01:42:18.166 --> 01:42:19.166
Plan B.

1623
01:42:48.666 --> 01:42:49.458
Doghead here.

1624
01:42:49.458 --> 01:42:51.041
X Target may be in the laundry room.

1625
01:42:51.416 --> 01:42:53.125
Piggy. laundry room south door.

1626
01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:53.708
Get over there.

1627
01:42:53.708 --> 01:42:54.250
Copy.

1628
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:56.041
What's Surveillance's ETA?

1629
01:43:10.166 --> 01:43:11.625
Leave him to us. you go.

1630
01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:19.250
Piggy.

1631
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:21.416
X Target has left the laundry room.

1632
01:43:21.833 --> 01:43:22.833
Lil Puppy and Pretty Face

1633
01:43:22.833 --> 01:43:23.958
are showing off their moves here.

1634
01:43:24.333 --> 01:43:25.875
I'll have a chat with them.

1635
01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:27.333
Try to get them to surrender.

1636
01:43:27.625 --> 01:43:28.916
Surrender. my ass.

1637
01:43:31.541 --> 01:43:32.500
Attention. all units.

1638
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:35.333
Wynn Palace South Lawn is packed with people.

1639
01:43:35.333 --> 01:43:36.833
There seems to be an event tonight.

1640
01:44:12.541 --> 01:44:13.291
Scratch that.

1641
01:44:13.541 --> 01:44:14.916
It’s Mad Puppy and Psycho Puss.

1642
01:44:34.125 --> 01:44:35.458
Piggy to Doghead.

1643
01:44:35.458 --> 01:44:36.208
Go. Piggy.

1644
01:44:36.208 --> 01:44:37.416
I'm at the party.

1645
01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:39.041
I think he's here.

1646
01:44:39.041 --> 01:44:39.875
but I can't find him.

1647
01:44:40.083 --> 01:44:40.791
Stay calm.

1648
01:44:42.208 --> 01:44:43.291
Doghead to Animal Paradise.

1649
01:44:43.291 --> 01:44:44.875
Use the Shadow's number to call him.

1650
01:44:44.875 --> 01:44:45.541
A.I. voice imitation?

1651
01:44:45.541 --> 01:44:46.791
Let the old man talk to them.

1652
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.583
Copy.

1653
01:45:04.458 --> 01:45:05.291
Godfather?

1654
01:45:10.583 --> 01:45:11.708
Xiwang died for nothing.

1655
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.041
Tracing X Target's phone now.

1656
01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:18.833
There is no anti-tracking.

1657
01:45:19.125 --> 01:45:20.000
He's not hiding anymore.

1658
01:45:20.375 --> 01:45:20.958
Piggy.

1659
01:45:21.125 --> 01:45:22.041
Focus.

1660
01:45:22.875 --> 01:45:24.166
Observe people's reactions.

1661
01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.083
Copy.

1662
01:45:26.125 --> 01:45:26.916
Simon.

1663
01:45:27.583 --> 01:45:28.833
the police are fishing for you.

1664
01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:32.333
If the police catch you today.

1665
01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:34.541
I'll be very disappointed.

1666
01:45:35.791 --> 01:45:37.125
I may have disappointed you already.

1667
01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:42.250
You had a good plan today.

1668
01:45:42.916 --> 01:45:44.000
I like it.

1669
01:45:44.666 --> 01:45:45.708
Thank you. Godfather.

1670
01:45:45.708 --> 01:45:46.625
But...

1671
01:45:46.625 --> 01:45:48.375
Anyone who knows what they're doing

1672
01:45:49.041 --> 01:45:50.500
would finish things themselves.

1673
01:45:52.083 --> 01:45:52.916
Noted.

1674
01:45:56.166 --> 01:45:57.125
In this regard.

1675
01:45:58.458 --> 01:46:00.625
Xiwang did a better job.

1676
01:46:12.875 --> 01:46:15.250
I was really hoping you'd all be able

1677
01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:17.583
to live the life you wanted.

1678
01:46:30.041 --> 01:46:32.040
This is my last time helping you.

1679
01:46:37.708 --> 01:46:38.791
Shadow was stalling on purpose.

1680
01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:39.916
There is a chance to identify him

1681
01:46:39.916 --> 01:46:40.875
if he tries to move.

1682
01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.375
Piggy.

1683
01:46:42.375 --> 01:46:44.500
Remember the key points of tracking?

1684
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.208
Find prominent and permanent features.

1685
01:46:46.208 --> 01:46:47.291
It's okay if your memory's fuzzy.

1686
01:46:48.916 --> 01:46:49.833
When you see those features.

1687
01:46:49.833 --> 01:46:51.041
Your brain will kick in to help.

1688
01:47:33.250 --> 01:47:34.375
I see him.

1689
01:47:34.875 --> 01:47:35.666
He's...

1690
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.833
Hello?

1691
01:47:55.875 --> 01:47:56.791
Let me out.

1692
01:48:57.041 --> 01:48:57.458
Madam.

1693
01:48:57.458 --> 01:48:58.666
Piggy's not answering.

1694
01:48:58.666 --> 01:49:00.541
Potsticker and Tofu are on-site.

1695
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:02.250
We need X Target's features.

1696
01:49:02.625 --> 01:49:03.625
Too many people at the party.

1697
01:49:03.625 --> 01:49:05.208
Everyone looks like X Target to me now.

1698
01:49:05.666 --> 01:49:07.916
Your X Target is 180 cm tall

1699
01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:09.333
and weighs 68 kg.

1700
01:49:09.333 --> 01:49:10.083
Long hair.

1701
01:49:10.416 --> 01:49:11.583
That's Wu Yaolei's comms.

1702
01:49:11.583 --> 01:49:13.291
He's sneaking into the VIP area.

1703
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.625
Animal Paradise. is the intel solid?

1704
01:49:16.458 --> 01:49:17.166
Cut him off.

1705
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:22.791
Take my earpiece.

1706
01:49:22.791 --> 01:49:23.666
I'll grab another from the car.

1707
01:49:23.666 --> 01:49:24.375
Report your position.

1708
01:49:24.375 --> 01:49:25.333
They're worried about you.

1709
01:49:25.708 --> 01:49:27.291
Shadow just ID'd X Target.

1710
01:49:27.291 --> 01:49:27.875
Don't worry.

1711
01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:31.500
Him and the driver are twins.

1712
01:49:34.958 --> 01:49:36.333
Piggy to Animal Paradise.

1713
01:49:36.666 --> 01:49:37.750
Sorry for making you worried.

1714
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:38.666
I'm glad you're okay.

1715
01:49:39.291 --> 01:49:40.083
Found anything?

1716
01:49:40.083 --> 01:49:41.833
The target and the driver are twins.

1717
01:49:47.333 --> 01:49:49.208
VIP area. I may have found him.

1718
01:49:54.166 --> 01:49:54.666
Who are you?

1719
01:49:54.666 --> 01:49:55.250
Sorry.

1720
01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:00.708
Should've never trusted Shadow.

1721
01:50:00.708 --> 01:50:01.833
He had his reasons.

1722
01:50:01.833 --> 01:50:03.000
Everyone. report your position.

1723
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Tofu. south entrance.

1724
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:04.958
Potsticker. north entrance.

1725
01:50:04.958 --> 01:50:06.250
Pork Bun. north side of the dance floor.

1726
01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:07.791
Rice Noodle and Lucky. laundry room.

1727
01:50:08.791 --> 01:50:09.333
Alpaca.

1728
01:50:10.083 --> 01:50:10.750
Where's Alpaca?

1729
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:12.500
He gave me his earpiece. he went to get another.

1730
01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:13.916
No new comm device activated.

1731
01:50:13.916 --> 01:50:15.333
His badge's GPS shows

1732
01:50:15.708 --> 01:50:16.625
he's headed to

1733
01:50:16.625 --> 01:50:17.875
Cotai East LRT station.

1734
01:50:25.625 --> 01:50:27.333
Him and the driver are twins!

1735
01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:36.708
Did you mean to...?

1736
01:51:38.583 --> 01:51:40.041
Doesn't matter now.

1737
01:51:59.541 --> 01:52:00.416
Fragile.

1738
01:52:01.208 --> 01:52:02.208
Lucky.

1739
01:52:02.541 --> 01:52:03.500
Relax.

1740
01:52:04.208 --> 01:52:05.333
Energy.

1741
01:52:07.625 --> 01:52:08.666
Target.

1742
01:52:09.041 --> 01:52:10.000
Amateur.

1743
01:52:10.333 --> 01:52:11.333
Family.

1744
01:52:11.875 --> 01:52:13.083
Shadow.

1745
01:52:13.541 --> 01:52:14.291
Betrayal.

1746
01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:14.916
Grateful.

1747
01:52:14.916 --> 01:52:15.750
Blind.

1748
01:52:20.958 --> 01:52:22.250
The times have changed.

1749
01:52:23.083 --> 01:52:24.666
But rules are rules.

1750
01:52:25.583 --> 01:52:26.500
Simon...

1751
01:52:27.375 --> 01:52:28.083
Farewell.

1752
01:52:35.416 --> 01:52:36.625
He's dead!

1753
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:43.166
Madam. Officer Wong.

1754
01:52:43.166 --> 01:52:44.583
we just caught the other two.

1755
01:52:44.583 --> 01:52:45.708
Without Shadow's direction.

1756
01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:46.916
they had nowhere to hide.

1757
01:52:47.416 --> 01:52:48.500
How's it going?

1758
01:52:50.083 --> 01:52:51.500
Madam. Officer Wong...

1759
01:53:01.416 --> 01:53:01.916
Liu Jinxiao.

1760
01:53:01.916 --> 01:53:02.791
The artery was cut.

1761
01:53:02.791 --> 01:53:03.375
Guoguo.

1762
01:53:03.375 --> 01:53:04.125
press his wound.

1763
01:53:04.125 --> 01:53:05.000
Don't let him move.

1764
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.125
Black cap.

1765
01:53:06.791 --> 01:53:08.083
dark blue jacket.

1766
01:53:08.083 --> 01:53:09.500
black jeans.

1767
01:53:13.541 --> 01:53:14.375
Jinxiao.

1768
01:53:15.125 --> 01:53:16.000
Jinxiao.

1769
01:53:16.458 --> 01:53:17.750
Don't you sleep.

1770
01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:20.750
Ambulance.

1771
01:53:21.666 --> 01:53:23.333
Ambulance.

1772
01:53:39.083 --> 01:53:40.375
I understand how you feel.

1773
01:53:41.375 --> 01:53:43.666
but there's another unit assigned to follow up.

1774
01:53:43.666 --> 01:53:45.166
We have a new assignment now.

1775
01:53:49.958 --> 01:53:51.083
Then I'm taking leave.

1776
01:53:51.416 --> 01:53:53.333
I need some time off. personal reasons.

1777
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:16.791
What are you doing here?

1778
01:54:17.041 --> 01:54:18.541
Wu sent this retiree

1779
01:54:18.541 --> 01:54:20.125
to keep someone on leave company.

1780
01:54:21.125 --> 01:54:21.916
Eat up.

1781
01:54:22.625 --> 01:54:23.333
Thanks.

1782
01:54:23.916 --> 01:54:25.125
What's the status?

1783
01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:26.250
No leads.

1784
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.708
It’s like the Shadow vanished into thin air.

1785
01:54:47.583 --> 01:54:48.500
Money.

1786
01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.625
It always leaves a trail.

1787
01:54:51.250 --> 01:54:52.583
especially in a case like this.

1788
01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.333
This is where the first victim's crypto

1789
01:54:59.333 --> 01:55:00.875
was transferred out to.

1790
01:55:01.125 --> 01:55:01.833
Those boys confessed that

1791
01:55:01.833 --> 01:55:03.416
only two people know the password.

1792
01:55:03.416 --> 01:55:04.875
One of them is dead.

1793
01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:06.458
And the money hasn’t moved. right?

1794
01:55:07.291 --> 01:55:07.958
Not a cent.

1795
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:09.458
Do you remember

1796
01:55:09.458 --> 01:55:10.166
what I told you about

1797
01:55:10.166 --> 01:55:11.083
what kind of thief

1798
01:55:11.291 --> 01:55:12.500
the Shadow is?

1799
01:55:13.458 --> 01:55:14.500
Old-timer.

1800
01:55:14.958 --> 01:55:15.833
Old school.

1801
01:55:17.416 --> 01:55:19.583
I know nothing about this stuff.

1802
01:55:19.583 --> 01:55:20.625
and I’m guessing

1803
01:55:21.291 --> 01:55:22.166
he doesn't. either.

1804
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.583
He’s still a man of that era.

1805
01:55:28.666 --> 01:55:30.333
What do you think he'll do?

1806
01:55:35.083 --> 01:55:37.125
He's clueless about cashing out crypto.

1807
01:55:41.958 --> 01:55:43.583
Fu was an old-school thief.

1808
01:55:43.583 --> 01:55:45.000
His MO back in the day

1809
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.083
was robbing jewelry stores

1810
01:55:47.083 --> 01:55:48.875
and getting victims to buy back the loot

1811
01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:50.375
to spare the trouble of fencing them.

1812
01:55:56.791 --> 01:55:58.041
This is all he knows.

1813
01:56:00.666 --> 01:56:01.416
Let's eat.

1814
01:56:01.416 --> 01:56:02.041
No time.

1815
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:02.666
Let’s go.

1816
01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:14.375
Why not take the door?

1817
01:56:16.125 --> 01:56:17.166
Why take the door?

1818
01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:23.208
Sophia. where are you?

1819
01:56:24.166 --> 01:56:25.041
Where's my milk?

1820
01:56:25.875 --> 01:56:26.833
It's been days already.

1821
01:56:27.875 --> 01:56:29.583
Did I get it wrong?

1822
01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:32.333
Trust your instincts.

1823
01:56:32.875 --> 01:56:34.250
Blame me if it's wrong.

1824
01:56:36.833 --> 01:56:37.958
That's what I planned to do.

1825
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:42.875
I’ve been thinking these past few days.

1826
01:56:44.875 --> 01:56:47.250
Carrying out the mission is our duty.

1827
01:56:47.916 --> 01:56:49.625
But having blood. emotion.

1828
01:56:50.041 --> 01:56:51.083
and a heart...

1829
01:56:52.041 --> 01:56:53.333
That's our nature.

1830
01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:58.333
Being a cop shouldn’t strip that away.

1831
01:57:03.666 --> 01:57:05.541
So. back then...

1832
01:57:08.375 --> 01:57:09.416
You did nothing wrong.

1833
01:57:44.375 --> 01:57:45.250
Police.

1834
01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:46.875
Everyone out.

1835
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.541
I know you want to make up a story.

1836
01:57:53.083 --> 01:57:55.833
but don't turn yourself into an accomplice.

1837
01:57:57.541 --> 01:57:59.208
Fu asked Wang for 10 million in cash

1838
01:57:59.208 --> 01:58:00.208
for the account password.

1839
01:58:00.458 --> 01:58:01.958
The meet's at Tin Seng Tea House.

1840
01:58:01.958 --> 01:58:02.916
I'll notify Captain Wu.

1841
01:58:02.916 --> 01:58:04.041
Don’t move until we get there.

1842
01:58:10.541 --> 01:58:11.500
Wu. what’s your ETA?

1843
01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:12.333
Ten minutes.

1844
01:58:12.333 --> 01:58:12.750
Officer Wong?

1845
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:13.583
Under 5 minutes.

1846
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.083
We've tapped Qiuguo's phone.

1847
01:58:21.583 --> 01:58:22.041
Copy.

1848
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.666
Copy.

1849
01:58:26.875 --> 01:58:28.041
Sound check.

1850
01:58:28.041 --> 01:58:29.208
Loud and clear.

1851
01:58:30.166 --> 01:58:32.208
Wang is already 10 minutes late.

1852
01:58:32.208 --> 01:58:33.500
He'll leave at any moment.

1853
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:42.666
He's leaving.

1854
01:58:48.875 --> 01:58:49.583
Hi.

1855
01:58:49.583 --> 01:58:51.166
Use the front door next time.

1856
01:59:11.333 --> 01:59:12.375
Small world.

1857
01:59:24.208 --> 01:59:24.875
Alone?

1858
01:59:29.333 --> 01:59:30.625
You have the wrong person.

1859
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:34.750
You don't know me?

1860
01:59:37.416 --> 01:59:38.958
We had dinner together.

1861
01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:40.833
Forgotten me already?

1862
01:59:45.333 --> 01:59:46.916
Do you need something?

1863
01:59:58.666 --> 02:00:00.250
I'm so moved.

1864
02:00:01.541 --> 02:00:03.125
It's you. Uncle.

1865
02:00:03.125 --> 02:00:04.250
What's with the outfit?

1866
02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:05.208
That hair of yours

1867
02:00:05.708 --> 02:00:06.666
freaked me out.

1868
02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:08.416
I thought you were some creepy old guy

1869
02:00:08.416 --> 02:00:10.000
trying to hit on me.

1870
02:00:13.583 --> 02:00:14.458
Sorry for scaring you.

1871
02:00:15.166 --> 02:00:16.000
I apologize.

1872
02:00:16.625 --> 02:00:17.375
No problem.

1873
02:00:20.083 --> 02:00:21.166
You were leaving.

1874
02:00:21.875 --> 02:00:23.791
Were you planning to tail me?

1875
02:00:33.416 --> 02:00:34.666
All by yourself?

1876
02:00:36.041 --> 02:00:37.083
Pardon?

1877
02:00:37.583 --> 02:00:38.958
What are you talking about?

1878
02:00:40.833 --> 02:00:42.000
A few days ago.

1879
02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:43.833
you were at Wynn.

1880
02:00:44.791 --> 02:00:46.500
You were with a boy.

1881
02:00:50.833 --> 02:00:51.791
Where's that boy now?

1882
02:00:58.458 --> 02:00:59.458
Dead.

1883
02:01:00.958 --> 02:01:01.875
Broke up?

1884
02:01:02.833 --> 02:01:04.500
Didn’t you hear me?

1885
02:01:06.875 --> 02:01:08.083

02:01:17.291 --> 02:01:19.208
He was killed in an LRT station.

1890
02:01:39.041 --> 02:01:40.583
That boy was a cop.

1891
02:01:44.125 --> 02:01:44.625
and so are you.

1892
02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:45.666
You’re crazy.

1893
02:01:46.583 --> 02:01:47.875
Get away from me.

1894
02:01:49.041 --> 02:01:49.916
Go away.

1895
02:01:59.166 --> 02:02:00.416
You've managed to stall me.

1896
02:02:00.416 --> 02:02:01.166
Kiddo...

1897
02:02:01.625 --> 02:02:02.458
You're pretty good.

1898
02:02:17.708 --> 02:02:18.291
Guoguo.

1899
02:02:20.958 --> 02:02:21.750
Call an ambulance.

Please use the front door.

1903
02:03:43.875 --> 02:03:47.333
Liked my West Lake vinegar fish?

1904
02:03:51.916 --> 02:03:53.166
It sucked.

1905
02:03:53.958 --> 02:03:56.208
Go to hell.

1906
02:03:57.958 --> 02:03:59.125
Join me.

1907
02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:25.666
Come on.

1908
02:06:34.375 --> 02:06:35.041

Guoguo.

1910
02:07:59.458 --> 02:08:00.500
Are you all right?

1911
02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:01.375
It's not deep.

1912
02:08:01.708 --> 02:08:02.416
I'll be fine.

1913
02:08:04.458 --> 02:08:05.625
Backup is almost here.

1914
02:08:05.625 --> 02:08:06.833
Earpiece is in the pocket.

1915
02:08:07.666 --> 02:08:08.250
Guoguo...

1916
02:08:08.666 --> 02:08:09.583
Go after him.

1917
02:08:12.333 --> 02:08:13.208
Target headed out front door.

1918
02:08:13.208 --> 02:08:14.416

1919
02:08:15.125 --> 02:08:15.958
I'm going after him.

1920
02:08:42.083 --> 02:08:43.916
Piggy. he's heading north.

1921
02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:45.541
There's no surveillance in the alley.

1922
02:08:45.541 --> 02:08:46.375
You have to find him yourself.

1923
02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:53.833
Possible suspect sighting.

1924
02:08:58.041 --> 02:08:58.916
It's not the Shadow.

1925
02:09:03.625 --> 02:09:04.708
The roads are a mess.

1926
02:09:04.708 --> 02:09:05.750
I can't find him.

1927
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:07.000
Qiuguo. stay calm.

1928
02:09:08.375 --> 02:09:09.333
Get it together.

1929
02:09:14.791 --> 02:09:15.625
I can't find him.

1932
02:09:20.791 --> 02:09:21.750
He can't be far.

1933
02:09:22.041 --> 02:09:22.875
You got this.

1934
02:09:28.666 --> 02:09:30.416
Remember the key points of tracking?

1935
02:09:30.416 --> 02:09:31.083
He Qiuguo?

1936
02:09:33.333 --> 02:09:33.791
Watch

1937
02:09:34.125 --> 02:09:34.791
and memorize.

1938
02:09:35.125 --> 02:09:36.375
You only get one glance.

1939
02:09:36.541 --> 02:09:37.583
Focus on key points.

1940
02:09:38.083 --> 02:09:39.125
All by yourself?

1941
02:09:42.208 --> 02:09:42.750
Memorize.

1942
02:09:43.833 --> 02:09:45.541
Memorize actively first.

1943
02:09:45.541 --> 02:09:46.250
Where's the boy?

1944
02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:47.208
Over time...

1945
02:09:47.333 --> 02:09:47.916
Broke up?

1946
02:09:47.916 --> 02:09:50.208
...You'll start to memorize subconsciously.

1947
02:09:57.791 --> 02:09:58.791
Go after him.

1948
02:10:02.166 --> 02:10:02.750
Hand.

1949
02:10:09.375 --> 02:10:10.125

Target spotted.

1951
02:10:29.541 --> 02:10:30.166
I got him.

1952
02:10:30.166 --> 02:10:30.583
Where are you?

We're here.

1956
02:10:38.708 --> 02:10:40.791
Sir. you can't take painkillers like that.

1957
02:10:42.375 --> 02:10:43.041
Guoguo.

1958
02:10:44.125 --> 02:10:45.125
You got this.

1959
02:10:48.541 --> 02:10:49.291
Wait.

1960
02:10:50.291 --> 02:10:51.208

02:10:51.208 --> 02:10:52.958

1962
02:10:52.958 --> 02:10:54.208

02:10:55.416 --> 02:10:56.000
Captain.

1964
02:10:56.208 --> 02:10:57.208
I can't do this alone.

1965
02:10:57.958 --> 02:10:58.958
I need my team.

1966
02:10:59.250 --> 02:11:00.250

We'll be needing your help in the future.

2034
02:15:38.708 --> 02:15:39.958
I've already taught them

2035
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:42.125
everything I know.

2036
02:15:43.166 --> 02:15:43.833
I'm going back

2037
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:45.958
to my retirement.

2038
02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:48.916

2040
02:18:59.583 --> 02:19:01.750
Why are we meeting here?

2041
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:02.958
We found a lead.

2042
02:19:02.958 --> 02:19:04.333
That hacker. Simon.

2043
02:19:04.333 --> 02:19:06.415
had help from someone much more capable.

2044
02:19:06.415 --> 02:19:08.000
My people thought so. too.

2045
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.415
We checked his computer.

2046
02:19:09.415 --> 02:19:11.875
There is no hacking source code in his devices.

2047
02:19:11.875 --> 02:19:14.125
The more important question is

2048
02:19:14.125 --> 02:19:15.415
why did this mastermind

2049
02:19:15.415 --> 02:19:18.500
deliberately leave loopholes for my people to find?

2050
02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:19.500
Wait.

2051
02:19:20.915 --> 02:19:23.083
I know who my people are.

2052
02:19:24.415 --> 02:19:26.958
Your people are...

2053
02:19:28.708 --> 02:19:30.165

2054
02:19:30.165 --> 02:19:31.915
you don't have the clearance yet.

2055
02:19:33.208 --> 02:19:35.790
Are't you just a retired dogwalker?

2056
02:19:36.333 --> 02:19:38.165
You sound like you have a secret identity.

2057
02:19:38.375 --> 02:19:40.165

2058
02:19:41.415 --> 02:19:43.165
