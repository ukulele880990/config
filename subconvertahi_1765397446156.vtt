2
00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:17.554
Hey.

3
00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.767
I know you're scared.
and I know you're angry.

4
00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:24.270
but I promise you.
we are here to help you.

5
00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:26.814
Hey. Derek. Derek.

6
00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:29.275
If you keep doing that.
you're gonna hurt yourself.

7
00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.778
Just calm down so we can talk. okay?

8
00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.115
Do you know who I am?

9
00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:37.825
An evil child kidnapper.

10
00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:41.869
Okay. I understand
why you would think that.

11
00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.996
but I'm not evil.

12
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.499
I'm just a mom. a regular mom.

13
00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:49.752
That's my son. Will.

14
00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:51.378
Zombie boy.

15
00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:53.297
You know why they call him that?

16
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.549
Because he died and came back to life.

17
00:00:55.632 --> 00:00:59.219
But what people don't know is
that when he went missing.

18
00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:03.223
he was taken by a terrible. scary monster.

19
00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:06.560
And now. that scary monster is after you.

20
00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:10.272
Yeah. I know. Mr. Whatsit told me.
which is why you need to let me go.

21
00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:13.817
No. no. Mr. Whatsit is not
who he says he is. okay?

22
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:17.196
He is lying to you.
All these monsters. they work for him.

23
00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:20.699
That's why we took you here to this barn.
We thought this barn was safe.

24
00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:21.784
but he's found us.

25
00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:24.578
So we have to move you again.
somewhere he can't find you.

26
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.624
So if I untie you.
will you cooperate and come with us?

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.293
Please?

28
00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:33.462
Okay. great.

29
00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:37.591
You're a very brave kid. Derek.
I want you to know that.

30
00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:39.093
Very--

31
00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:49.561
-Let me go! Get off of me!
-Derek. Please!

32
00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:51.522
-The door! Get the door!
-Help me!

33
00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:53.273
Let me go! Get off me!

34
00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:55.943
-Stay down!
-Get away!

35
00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:58.821
Somebody help! I'm being kidnapped!

36
00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.031
Get away from me! Let me go!

37
00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:03.075
Mom. the rope! I need the rope!

38
00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:06.620
-Let me go! Eat dirt!
-Ah!

39
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.166
Come try us. dipshit!

40
00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:12.207
Shit!

41
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.679
Dude! She's not lying to you. okay?

42
00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:29.182
Mr. Whatsit is a very bad guy.
He sent the monsters after you.

43
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.809
Suck my fat one!

44
00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:32.102
Jesus! What?

45
00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.437
You just signed
your death warrant. dipshit!

46
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.398
You're a psycho. and you're going to jail!

47
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.984
-There is a monster coming!
-We're trying to help you.

48
00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:40.819
-La. la. la. la.
-Derek. please!

49
00:02:40.902 --> 00:02:42.112
You gotta come down.

50
00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.197
I'm not listening. La. la. la. la.

51
00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:08.847
Stay back!

52
00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:21.359
You want him.
you're gonna have to come through me!

53
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.221
Yeah. we got him! We got him!

54
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.324
It flipped! It's headed back towards us!

55
00:04:09.407 --> 00:04:11.493
Come on. What are you doing. man?
We gotta turn around!

56
00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.536
Wait. Gates are like
Peanut Butter Boppers. right?

57
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.498
-What?
-The outside is. like. crunchy and tough.

58
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.125
But bite down on it.
it gives way to a gooey. creamy core.

59
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.002
Dude. what the hell are you talking about?

60
00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.630
I drive fast enough.
the beamer can punch a hole into the gate.

61
00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.925
and then we can track the Demo
on its home turf in the Upside Down.

62
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:29.052
-Follow it back home.
-We're losing the signal!

63
00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.054
We won't be able to follow anything
if we crash!

64
00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.764
We won't crash if it's like a Bopper!

65
00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:33.765
It's almost gone!

66
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:37.602
Do it.

67
00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:43.817
-Oh my God! Oh my God!
-Jesus.

68
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.819
-Oh my God! Oh my God!
-I got it! I got it!

69
00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:47.612
Oh God. no!

70
00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:49.531
-It's not gonna work.
-We're not gonna make it!

71
00:04:49.614 --> 00:04:52.575
-It's not a Bopper. Stop!
-Slow down! Jesus Christ!

72
00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.828
-Shit! Oh my God!
-Hang on!

73
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.546
We did it! Woo!

74
00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:07.966
Signal?

75
00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.094
-Strong!
-Oh my God!

76
00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:13.888
We got you. son of a bitch! We got you!

77
00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:31.448
Will!? Will!

78
00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:35.160
I'm right here. Will.

79
00:05:35.243 --> 00:05:36.786
It's okay.

80
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.955
I got you. I got you.

81
00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.793
I got you. sweetie.

82
00:06:47.357 --> 00:06:50.360
Uh. hockety-pockety?

83
00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.736
Oh. yes. yes. that's right.

84
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.906
Hockety-pockety wockety wack
Odds and ends and bric-a-brac

85
00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:56.825
-I'll be with you in just a minute. son.
-What?

86
00:06:56.908 --> 00:06:58.326
Packing's almost done!

87
00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:02.914
Shush!

88
00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:05.417
Jelly!

89
00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:12.924
Alan Miller?

90
00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:15.218
I'm sorry. what is this about?

91
00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:17.846
It's your daughter. sir.

92
00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.171
Our boy's taking us on a shortcut
through Roane Cemetery.

93
00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:53.798
-That's almost at the county line.
-Doesn't this thing get tired?

94
00:07:53.882 --> 00:07:57.177
Unfortunately. it looks like the opposite.
I think he's speeding up.

95
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.928
-What?
-I'm losing the signal.

96
00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:00.221
You've gotta be shitting me!

97
00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:01.806
-Can you go faster?
-Let's see.

98
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.812
Henderson. you've gotta talk to me.
What do you got?

99
00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:10.023
-Henderson. what--
-I'm picking up interference.

100
00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:12.484
-How is that important?
-It means I can't hear the signal.

101
00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:14.152
-Listen harder.
-What do you mean?

102
00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:15.987
-You wanna put these on?
-I'm driving!

103
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.947
You do the driving. I do the navigating.

104
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.116
-What is that?
-I don't know.

105
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.451
Steve. slow down.

106
00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.119
Is he ahead of us or not?

107
00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:25.705
-Steve!
-Steve. watch out!

108
00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:27.624
-Steve. watch out!
-Shit!

109
00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:36.549
Jonathan.
it's Mom. Answer me. please. Over.

110
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.968
Jonathan. please answer.

111
00:08:39.636 --> 00:08:44.807
Jonathan. Nancy. Dustin. it's Joyce.
Please answer me.

112
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.434
Hey.

113
00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:47.685
Any luck?

114
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.690
Well. on the plus side.
I guess that means they made it through.

115
00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:54.317
Do you wanna see where they're headed?

116
00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:26.307
What is it?

117
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:27.725
I don't know.

118
00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:32.730
but I could feel it's important to him.

119
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:35.900
To Mr… Whatsit?

120
00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:37.527
His real name is Henry.

121
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.570
AKA Vecna.

122
00:09:38.653 --> 00:09:39.737
AKA One.

123
00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:41.364
That's too many names.

124
00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:44.158
Why won't you just zip it
and listen. dipshit?

125
00:09:44.242 --> 00:09:47.120
I had this feeling
he didn't want me there.

126
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.623
I wasn't supposed to see it.

127
00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:54.002
You've never been this close
to the hive mind before.

128
00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:56.879
I mean. that thing was. like. feet away.

129
00:09:58.673 --> 00:10:01.926
Sometimes at The Squawk.
when a signal comes in too strong.

130
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.845
it overloads the whole system.

131
00:10:03.928 --> 00:10:06.472
I think that's what this was. an overload.

132
00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:08.975
You didn't just tap into the hive mind.

133
00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:12.395
You jacked right in
to the goddamn control center.

134
00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:14.689
And Holly. Where was Holly?

135
00:10:14.772 --> 00:10:17.650
Holly. Holly. she was…

136
00:10:17.734 --> 00:10:21.112
She was attached to this… this spire.

137
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:26.659
And she became a part of it somehow.
like it was doing something to her.

138
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:29.787
And… And there were others.

139
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.582
There were three others.

140
00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:37.837
I thought
Vecna was just coming for dipshit.

141
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.090
So did I. But I only knew about Derek
because he walked right past me.

142
00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.053
Serendipitous timing.

143
00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:47.930
-You hear that? Serendipitous.
-I don't know what that means.

144
00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.225
I'm really not loving
all of these extra spires.

145
00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:54.854
I mean. night one. Vecna kidnaps Holly.
Night two. he takes three more.

146
00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:57.398
He's escalating. And he's coming for more.

147
00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:00.735
Eight more. if this is accurate.
which brings him to a total of 12.

148
00:11:00.818 --> 00:11:03.988
What does he want with them? And why kids?

149
00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:05.156
-And why 12?
-I don't know.

150
00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:07.241
But we have to stop him
before he takes any more

151
00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:10.244
and buy Dustin and the others time
to find this place. to find Holly.

152
00:11:10.328 --> 00:11:14.040
If we can pinpoint his exact targets.
we could get them out of Hawkins.

153
00:11:14.123 --> 00:11:15.375
And out of Vecna's reach.

154
00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:16.751
Did you forget we're quarantined?

155
00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:19.003
-That's not all.
-There's another problem.

156
00:11:19.087 --> 00:11:21.714
On the way here.
we saw soldiers load Debbie Miller

157
00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:23.675
onto a bus with a bunch more kids.

158
00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:26.761
We followed them for two blocks more.
and they loaded more kids onto it.

159
00:11:26.844 --> 00:11:29.889
I don't think
they were taking them to school.

160
00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:32.016
Vecna's not the only one
that wants these kids.

161
00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:42.151
Eleven was at the Wheeler house
the same night Holly was taken.

162
00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:45.446
Twenty-four hours later.
we've got three more missing kids.

163
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.575
There's 73 children in Hawkins
between the age of nine and ten.

164
00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:53.371
If the pattern holds.
our next target will be from this group.

165
00:11:53.454 --> 00:11:57.208
And you believe
Eleven has taken these kids?

166
00:11:57.291 --> 00:11:58.459
For what purpose?

167
00:11:58.543 --> 00:12:02.004
Killing them. protecting them.
The reason doesn't matter.

168
00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.756
These children? Where are they now?

169
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.218
Arriving at the MAC-Z any moment.
which is where I want you.

170
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:09.971
I should be looking for Lt. Akers.
I find Akers. I find--

171
00:12:10.054 --> 00:12:12.098
You'll find a dead man.

172
00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:14.934
Report to the MAC-Z. Colonel.
That's an order.

173
00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:23.234
Major General.

174
00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:28.239
With all due respect.
these kids are in danger.

175
00:12:28.322 --> 00:12:30.533
To use them as bait seems…

176
00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:34.412
Seems what. Sergeant?

177
00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:37.331
Reckless.

178
00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.463
It's only reckless
if you fail to protect them.

179
00:12:44.213 --> 00:12:47.508
Are you telling me
you can't protect them. Sergeant?

180
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.051
No. ma'am.

181
00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:52.555
Good.

182
00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:07.987
I'm sorry for scaring you.

183
00:13:09.697 --> 00:13:13.409
I haven't seen anyone
in… a really long time. so…

184
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:16.537
I guess I got excited.

185
00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:20.750
Good news is it doesn't look that deep.

186
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.293
Not enough for stitches.

187
00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:25.213
I bet it stings though. huh?

188
00:13:27.465 --> 00:13:29.550
You can talk to me. you know.

189
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.886
I won't bite.

190
00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:36.557
You do remember me. right?

191
00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:39.477
I've been to your house.

192
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.770
Like. a lot.

193
00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:46.609
You're Max. Max Mayfield.

194
00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:49.028
You skateboard
and never take off your Walkman.

195
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:51.197
-That's me.
-But--

196
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.866
How am I in here
when I'm in a coma in Hawkins General?

197
00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:58.079
That's a very reasonable question.

198
00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.375
We should get going.
It's not safe here. Come on.

199
00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:05.044
Where are we going?

200
00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:05.962
My home.

201
00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:08.214
Well. I can't go far.
I came here to meet Henry.

202
00:14:08.297 --> 00:14:10.091
-Do you know Henry?
-You could say that.

203
00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:13.970
He left me this note. See? And he told me
to meet him right here at the X.

204
00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:15.721
I think he's in trouble with the monsters.

205
00:14:15.805 --> 00:14:18.516
Henry is a lot of things. but in trouble
with the monsters is not one of them.

206
00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:20.685
-But the note says--
-I know what the note says.

207
00:14:20.768 --> 00:14:22.895
How do you know he's not in trouble?
He said hurry!

208
00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:26.190
Holly. I know what the note says
because Henry didn't write it. I did.

209
00:14:27.483 --> 00:14:30.862
I don't… I don't understand.

210
00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:33.155
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:38.661
I didn't want to lie. I… I just…
I had to make sure that you came here.

212
00:14:39.787 --> 00:14:41.289
You're one of them. aren't you?

213
00:14:41.998 --> 00:14:43.332
-One of what?
-The monsters.

214
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.294
-Do I look like a monster?
-I don't know. Maybe you're in disguise.

215
00:14:46.377 --> 00:14:48.504
You're dressed weird.
and you're in a coma.

216
00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:49.755
Okay.

217
00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:53.759
Well. would a monster know
that your brother tried to get a mohawk

218
00:14:53.843 --> 00:14:55.469
until your sister stopped him.

219
00:14:55.553 --> 00:14:58.514
saving him from possibly
the greatest social humiliation

220
00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:00.975
that a freshman has ever experienced
at Hawkins High?

221
00:15:02.018 --> 00:15:03.853
What color was this mohawk?

222
00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:05.438
Hot orange.

223
00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:09.567
And personally. I think the use
of the word "hot" is a bit ironic. but…

224
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.235
People say I'm too negative.

225
00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:12.737
I just think I'm honest.

226
00:15:35.843 --> 00:15:36.844
Come on.

227
00:15:45.937 --> 00:15:46.979
Welcome.

228
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:06.165
Hey.

229
00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.167
It even comes with a view.

230
00:16:31.273 --> 00:16:32.483
Where are we?

231
00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.777
In a memory.

232
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.615
Which exists inside a world
of 1.000 memories.

233
00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:41.242
I know it might look nice.

234
00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:43.285
but it's not.

235
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:46.747
This place. this world…

236
00:16:48.124 --> 00:16:49.208
It's a prison.

237
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:56.841
Henry's prison.

238
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.827
It's okay. sweetie.

239
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.456
These are the good guys.
They're going to keep everyone safe.

240
00:17:28.539 --> 00:17:32.376
Just try and think of this
as a field trip.

241
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.129
Mm-hmm. A learning expedition.

242
00:17:47.516 --> 00:17:53.022
Cargo has arrived.
I repeat. cargo has arrived.

243
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.611
They're taking them into a barracks
second from the library.

244
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.661
Tunnels.

245
00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:17.588
Yeah. See? The north tunnel of the MAC-Z
runs right underneath the barracks.

246
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:19.882
-Lucky break.
-Bound to happen one of these days.

247
00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.675
Gonna need more luck
if we want this plan to work.

248
00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:24.595
If we're right. the military is trying
to protect these kids.

249
00:18:24.678 --> 00:18:26.472
So this barracks
is gonna be heavily guarded.

250
00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:28.974
We have to dig up
into the barracks. unnoticed.

251
00:18:29.058 --> 00:18:31.268
grab the kids. get them to Murray.
smuggle them out of Hawkins.

252
00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:33.479
All before anyone notices they're gone.

253
00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:35.231
-Dick.
-What?

254
00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:37.358
What? Oh.

255
00:18:37.858 --> 00:18:40.986
Sorry. Did I say that out loud?
I thought I was talking in my head.

256
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.280
But you guys know
Tom. Dick. and Harry. right?

257
00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.618
Seriously? None of you have seen
The Great Escape?

258
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:51.288
Basically. it's about these POWs. right?

259
00:18:51.372 --> 00:18:54.291
And they're stuck
in a barracks just like this one.

260
00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:56.168
They need to escape.
so they dig these tunnels.

261
00:18:56.252 --> 00:18:58.671
and they call their tunnels
Tom. Dick. and Harry.

262
00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:00.589
They have to hide the tunnels
from the Nazis.

263
00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:03.926
So they put Tom in this dark corner.
and they put Harry under the stove.

264
00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:08.139
and they put Dick in the washroom.
And personally. for us. I like Dick.

265
00:19:11.267 --> 00:19:15.855
Oh. um… Sorry. The washroom.
I actually don't even… Never mind.

266
00:19:15.938 --> 00:19:17.731
Okay. say we go with Dick.

267
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.109
How do we find the washroom?

268
00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.735
And how do we get the kids to it?

269
00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:24.238
How do we know
which kids are being targeted by Vecna?

270
00:19:24.321 --> 00:19:27.825
We use an inside man.
someone who could get into the barracks.

271
00:19:27.908 --> 00:19:31.078
measure the distance to the washroom.
find out which kids have seen Mr. Whatsit.

272
00:19:31.162 --> 00:19:32.746
and somehow avoid the military.

273
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.000
Well. that's a lovely plan.
but isn't it a tad…

274
00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:37.209
Mission Impossible-y.

275
00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:40.588
Yeah. I mean. Mike.
who are you gonna get to do this?

276
00:19:40.671 --> 00:19:41.755
Bond? Magnum?

277
00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:43.799
No. no. we don't want a superspy.

278
00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:46.552
We want the opposite.
We want someone no one would suspect.

279
00:19:47.136 --> 00:19:49.597
Someone that could just walk in.
no questions asked.

280
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.057
The one kid
the military failed to wrangle.

281
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:00.065
What?

282
00:20:29.637 --> 00:20:34.433
Two grunts in the tower by the west gate.

283
00:20:34.516 --> 00:20:36.894
One more in the tower by the east gate.

284
00:20:36.977 --> 00:20:39.104
One. two. three. four on the ground.

285
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.566
I hope to God you're right.
and Vecna is in there.

286
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.818
because we might just die
trying to break in.

287
00:20:44.902 --> 00:20:45.945
I am right.

288
00:20:46.028 --> 00:20:49.031
You can't be right about everything.
Your theories aren't exactly lining up.

289
00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:51.700
-Why not?
-You heard kryptonite.

290
00:20:51.784 --> 00:20:53.661
If Vecna's in there.
he doesn't have his powers.

291
00:20:53.744 --> 00:20:54.870
If he doesn't have his powers.

292
00:20:54.954 --> 00:20:57.122
how could he have anything to do
with Holly's kidnapping?

293
00:20:57.206 --> 00:20:58.874
You can ask him before I kill him.

294
00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:01.335
How high is that fence?

295
00:21:02.336 --> 00:21:04.004
Hey. you're not jumping that.

296
00:21:04.088 --> 00:21:05.381
Why not?

297
00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:09.718
Because this is not training.
This is a real-world situation.

298
00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:12.096
And that roof is metal.

299
00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:15.474
You hit that on a jump.
you're gonna alert the whole damn base.

300
00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:17.017
Not if I time it with the thunder.

301
00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:18.686
Yeah.

302
00:21:18.769 --> 00:21:20.229
It's seven seconds.

303
00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:30.990
One. two. three. four. five. six…

304
00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:35.411
Seven.

305
00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.954
Okay. You got lucky.

306
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:40.332
-Hopper. do you copy?
-Dustin!

307
00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:41.917
Over. This is Dustin.

308
00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:44.503
Hopper. do you copy? This is Dustin.

309
00:21:44.586 --> 00:21:47.047
Hey. hey. it's Hop. I copy.

310
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:49.883
Holy shit! Okay. They're alive!

311
00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:51.051
El! Ask about El.

312
00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:52.344
El. Is El with you? Over.

313
00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:54.263
Yes. I'm here. Over.

314
00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:56.348
Okay. Yay. Terrific.

315
00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:59.101
I don't know if you're caught up
in something important. but--

316
00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:00.185
-Dustin. Come on.
-Meet us!

317
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:02.646
Meet us at Roane Cemetery church. please.

318
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.733
Roane Cemetery. How the hell
are you contacting us from there?

319
00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:08.777
Right. You don't know.
We're in the Upside Down.

320
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:09.820
What?

321
00:22:09.903 --> 00:22:12.948
Long story short. we're here to track
a Demogorgon using our telemetry tracker.

322
00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.951
only to then hit a wall. Literally.
Now. Steve's beamer is stuck.

323
00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:18.120
so we need El to come and pry it loose
using her powers

324
00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.997
so we can resume the search
for said Demogorgon

325
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.250
which will. in theory. lead us to Holly.
Does any of this make sense?

326
00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:26.754
Do you need additional details?
Questions? Concerns? Over.

327
00:22:26.837 --> 00:22:28.005
You hit a wall?

328
00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:30.758
What kind of wall. exactly?

329
00:22:31.842 --> 00:22:36.263
Uh… it's a bit… hard to describe.

330
00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:38.974
-Sort of…
-Huge?

331
00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.393
Disgusting.

332
00:22:41.477 --> 00:22:43.562
Smells like Henderson's armpit.

333
00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:46.607
We hit the same thing.
but not at the Roane Cemetery.

334
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.443
We hit it a quarter mile southeast
of the old Hagen Bridge.

335
00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:52.154
That's the opposite side of town.

336
00:22:53.447 --> 00:22:54.490
Fascinating.

337
00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:56.784
We don't know what it is.
but we think Holly's behind it.

338
00:22:56.867 --> 00:22:59.578
Don't bother trying to break through.
You can't.

339
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.288
We're working on a solution.

340
00:23:02.289 --> 00:23:04.917
-Nancy.
-Solution? What kind of solution?

341
00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:08.670
Wait. what kind of solution? Hopper!

342
00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:11.465
Listen. we gotta keep the airwaves clear.
all right?

343
00:23:11.548 --> 00:23:13.842
We'll come get you. Just stay put.

344
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.137
You think they're safe?

345
00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:18.931
I mean. compared to us? Yeah.

346
00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:20.933
Okay.

347
00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:24.019
Let's go see
if that training has paid off.

348
00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:25.896
You're gonna let me jump?

349
00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:29.316
Let's go before I change my mind.

350
00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.033
Vecna's curse.

351
00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:40.744
it never goes away.

352
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.621
Never leaves you.

353
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.375
With each victim that he took.
he created a new gate.

354
00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.502
A gate to the Upside Down?

355
00:23:49.503 --> 00:23:53.549
When he took me.
he opened the fourth. final gate.

356
00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:54.800
splitting Hawkins in two.

357
00:23:56.885 --> 00:24:03.600
Wait. but if Mr. Whatsit…
I mean Henry. took you. how are you here?

358
00:24:03.684 --> 00:24:05.185
You mean. shouldn't I be dead?

359
00:24:06.687 --> 00:24:08.856
It's okay. It's a fair question.

360
00:24:09.731 --> 00:24:10.858
I definitely should be.

361
00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:13.527
And for a moment…

362
00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:15.904
I was.

363
00:24:19.366 --> 00:24:21.076
I don't know how long I was gone.

364
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.581
But then I felt something… calling to me.

365
00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:19.301
Life could be dream

366
00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:22.262
If I could take you up
In Paradise up above

367
00:25:23.013 --> 00:25:24.681
If you would tell me I'm the only…

368
00:25:24.765 --> 00:25:28.185
One night only. Don't miss it.
Tickets are only 50 cents.

369
00:25:28.268 --> 00:25:30.479
That's two quarters for you poindexters.

370
00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:35.150
-Joyce! This that stupid play of yours?
-I better see you there. Harrington.

371
00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:37.402
Friday night? You wish.

372
00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:40.322
Life could be dream

373
00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:41.907
Nice shot. jerk.

374
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.034
If only all my precious plans
Would come true

375
00:25:45.327 --> 00:25:48.705
Somehow. I was in another time.

376
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:50.123
Hawkins.

377
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.960
Thirty years ago.

378
00:25:53.043 --> 00:25:54.169
Time travel.

379
00:25:55.087 --> 00:25:57.923
Only. I wasn't actually there.

380
00:25:58.549 --> 00:26:00.342
Not really. I was just…

381
00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:02.678
an observer.

382
00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:08.016
And that's when I understood.

383
00:26:08.725 --> 00:26:12.020
I was trapped inside Henry's mind.
his memories.

384
00:26:12.104 --> 00:26:15.065
Like a nightmare prison world

385
00:26:15.148 --> 00:26:19.111
ruled by an evil.
psychopathic piece of shit.

386
00:26:20.028 --> 00:26:21.154
Like Camazotz.

387
00:26:21.238 --> 00:26:23.198
Cama… What?

388
00:26:23.282 --> 00:26:25.534
Camazotz. From A Wrinkle in Time.

389
00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:27.536
-Never read it.
-You should. It's amazing.

390
00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:30.581
Camazotz is like this dark planet
that's under the control of IT.

391
00:26:30.664 --> 00:26:32.833
which is this giant.
disembodied. evil brain.

392
00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:34.918
Anyways. Meg's dad…
Meg's the main character.

393
00:26:35.002 --> 00:26:36.461
…he gets taken prisoner there.

394
00:26:36.545 --> 00:26:39.715
So. Henry's kinda like IT.
and you're kinda like Meg's dad.

395
00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:40.966
Okay. Well…

396
00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:44.845
I don't know if Meg's dad would agree.
but the way I see it.

397
00:26:44.928 --> 00:26:48.724
when you're a prisoner
in a messed up prison world.

398
00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:50.851
you really only have
a few doors open to you.

399
00:26:51.935 --> 00:26:54.730
Door one. you take your own life.

400
00:26:56.023 --> 00:26:58.692
Door two. accept your fate.

401
00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:01.153
-Or door three…
-You escape.

402
00:27:01.737 --> 00:27:04.406
-I chose door three.
-That seems like the best door.

403
00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:07.576
So. I kept moving.

404
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.621
From memory to memory.

405
00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:13.832
Only. this place is a maze.

406
00:27:14.541 --> 00:27:19.004
I became lost. turned around.
I got so turned around.

407
00:27:19.087 --> 00:27:21.923
I actually ended up
right back at the beginning.

408
00:27:32.142 --> 00:27:33.727
And that's when I heard her.

409
00:27:37.064 --> 00:27:38.565
I heard Kate Bush.

410
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:40.525
Is she one of your friends?

411
00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:43.445
You could say that.

412
00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:46.657
Do you wanna hear
About the deal that I'm making?

413
00:27:47.824 --> 00:27:51.578
Music has a way of finding you.
even in the darkest of places.

414
00:27:51.662 --> 00:27:55.874
Lucas had used it before. to reach me.
to guide me out of Vecna's mind.

415
00:27:56.458 --> 00:27:57.417
back to the light.

416
00:27:58.794 --> 00:28:02.798
If I only could make a deal with God

417
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.967
And I'd get him to swap our places

418
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:08.053
Be runnin' up that road

419
00:28:08.136 --> 00:28:13.308
So. this music was coming from Lucas.
from the real world?

420
00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:19.940
Even after all this time.

421
00:28:21.358 --> 00:28:22.818
he hadn't given up on me.

422
00:28:23.402 --> 00:28:25.654
If you follow this music.

423
00:28:26.613 --> 00:28:27.572
then what?

424
00:28:28.615 --> 00:28:30.617
Then it would lead me out of here.

425
00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:33.578
Back home.

426
00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:37.749
At least. that's what I thought.

427
00:28:40.502 --> 00:28:41.545
But then…

428
00:28:45.424 --> 00:28:47.300
everything went wrong.

429
00:28:47.384 --> 00:28:50.512
Oh. come on. angel
Come on. come on. darlin'

430
00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:53.056
Let's exchange the…

431
00:29:13.493 --> 00:29:14.786
Hey!

432
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:20.834
What the hell are you doing?
Can't you read. kid? No trespassing.

433
00:29:20.917 --> 00:29:22.836
Right. I see that. officer.

434
00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:25.505
It's just… my school is missing.

435
00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:33.221
Let's go.

436
00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:44.566
Move it.

437
00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:52.699
Holy shit! Are those laser blasters?

438
00:29:52.783 --> 00:29:54.075
Might just be.

439
00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.620
And they'll blast you
if you don't keep it moving.

440
00:30:00.916 --> 00:30:02.876
-Boys.
-Can't get me!

441
00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:03.960
Boys!

442
00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:08.340
All right. Absolutely not.

443
00:30:09.132 --> 00:30:10.842
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

444
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.513
This is Private Chapman.
You do exactly as he says.

445
00:30:14.596 --> 00:30:17.265
You got any questions. direct them to him.

446
00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:20.227
Where might I relieve myself?

447
00:30:22.896 --> 00:30:24.189
Breaking bar.

448
00:30:24.981 --> 00:30:26.107
Shovel.

449
00:30:27.484 --> 00:30:29.361
Five safety goggles.

450
00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:32.614
A surveyor's wheel and…

451
00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:34.157
Hold for applause.

452
00:30:37.953 --> 00:30:41.206
Santa's sleigh is ready for his reindeer.

453
00:30:41.289 --> 00:30:45.627
We got built-in benches.
seat belts. foam padding.

454
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.421
Everything a kidnapped child could desire.

455
00:30:48.505 --> 00:30:49.589
Foam padding?

456
00:30:49.673 --> 00:30:52.926
Don't want to break any eggs en route.
now do we?

457
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.639
I'm in. Do you copy?
Repeat. I'm in. Do you copy?

458
00:30:57.722 --> 00:31:00.308
Yes. yes. we copy. We copy. Where are you?

459
00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:03.812
Bathroom. Back stall.
45 of my paces from the front entrance.

460
00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:06.731
Good job. Now round up anyone
who's seen Mr. Whatsit.

461
00:31:06.815 --> 00:31:08.149
and we'll be there soon.

462
00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:11.653
And remember. you're not Dipshit Derek.
You're--

463
00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.071
Delightful Derek.

464
00:31:24.374 --> 00:31:28.920
Okay. once you get
that gate open. and I'm inside…

465
00:31:29.004 --> 00:31:30.964
-You lead.
-That's right.

466
00:31:31.047 --> 00:31:32.048
And you?

467
00:31:32.716 --> 00:31:36.428
I will destroy your kryptonite.
Don't worry.

468
00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:38.597
Okay.

469
00:32:20.555 --> 00:32:23.808
All right. come on.
Come on. you got this. You got this.

470
00:32:54.798 --> 00:32:56.466
Wait. You're too early. You're too early.

471
00:33:02.764 --> 00:33:03.682
God.

472
00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:07.936
Sorry.

473
00:33:12.774 --> 00:33:15.360
You trying to give
your old man a heart attack?

474
00:33:15.443 --> 00:33:16.945
Nice job. by the way.

475
00:33:23.952 --> 00:33:24.828
Hop?

476
00:33:24.911 --> 00:33:25.954
Yeah?

477
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.581
Thank you.

478
00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:30.041
For what?

479
00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:31.751
For teaching me.

480
00:33:33.503 --> 00:33:34.879
And trusting me.

481
00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:37.340
Always.

482
00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.433
The day of reckoning has arrived.

483
00:33:46.516 --> 00:33:48.810
With this in mind.
I've been sent by Mr. Whatsit

484
00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.145
to gather the chosen ones.

485
00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.814
If you've been visited by Mr. Whatsit.
speak now.

486
00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:55.400
And when night falls.
follow me to the latrine.

487
00:33:55.483 --> 00:33:58.695
and I will lead you
to our savior. to safety.

488
00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.698
Derek's gone mental.

489
00:34:03.491 --> 00:34:06.286
The monsters are coming.
and you're all gonna die.

490
00:34:08.204 --> 00:34:09.247
Derek?

491
00:34:10.623 --> 00:34:12.167
Were you talking about Henry?

492
00:34:23.678 --> 00:34:25.346
Any word from Derek yet?

493
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.765
Not yet.

494
00:34:26.848 --> 00:34:29.392
Just give him time.
It hasn't been that long.

495
00:34:29.476 --> 00:34:31.728
I just can't get over the fact

496
00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:36.274
that the fate of the world rests
on Derek freakin' Turnbow.

497
00:34:36.357 --> 00:34:39.527
When you look in the mirror. do you see
a Navy SEAL looking back at you?

498
00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:42.614
Sometimes people need
someone to believe in them.

499
00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:46.201
And then they can do amazing things.

500
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:49.079
Your mom and Robin
are getting along better.

501
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:52.916
Well. it didn't hurt
that Mom scared off that Demo.

502
00:34:52.999 --> 00:34:55.877
Saved Robin's life. everybody's life.

503
00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:02.634
So. when your mom. when she had her axe.

504
00:35:02.717 --> 00:35:04.010
you could see her?

505
00:35:04.094 --> 00:35:06.012
-Like. through the Demo's eyes?
-Yeah.

506
00:35:06.096 --> 00:35:08.473
And I was so close to the hive.

507
00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:13.103
it's like I could feel
what it was feeling. like this anger.

508
00:35:13.186 --> 00:35:15.563
That I was still in there too.

509
00:35:15.647 --> 00:35:17.941
And I was afraid. I was afraid for my mom.

510
00:35:18.024 --> 00:35:21.653
-You wanted to protect her.
-Yeah. But I… I just couldn't.

511
00:35:22.237 --> 00:35:25.031
It was like this scary movie
you just can't turn off.

512
00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:30.787
Open sesame.

513
00:35:32.038 --> 00:35:35.250
Oh. Well. have fun.

514
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.043
Thanks.

515
00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:40.380
-Are you positive you didn't?
-Didn't what?

516
00:35:40.463 --> 00:35:41.548
Turn off the scary movie.

517
00:35:41.631 --> 00:35:43.299
Protect your mom.
not the other way around.

518
00:35:43.383 --> 00:35:46.052
No offense. I know she's badass
and everything. but you know.

519
00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:47.679
-Yeah. she's 5'3".
-Yeah!

520
00:35:47.762 --> 00:35:50.932
And Vecna likes to control the hive mind
like a puppet master.

521
00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:53.977
So maybe when you tap into the hive.
you can pull the strings too.

522
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.146
Except I'm not Vecna.

523
00:35:56.229 --> 00:35:57.230
You sorta are.

524
00:35:57.939 --> 00:36:01.025
You're trying to say that I'm evil
and hell-bent on destroying the world?

525
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:02.068
Totally.

526
00:36:02.152 --> 00:36:05.572
No. I'm just saying that. you know.
you're like a wizard like him.

527
00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:07.615
In D&D. Mike. not real life.

528
00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:10.076
True. In real life.
you're more like a sorcerer.

529
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.996
because your powers don't come
from a book of spells. They're innate.

530
00:36:13.997 --> 00:36:17.167
Listen. as far as crazy theories go.
I've had crazier.

531
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.420
And with Eleven in the Upside Down.
we really need some magic up here.

532
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:00.543
Working on a solution?

533
00:37:00.627 --> 00:37:04.714
I mean. if Hopper has a solution
to get through this and to get to Holly.

534
00:37:04.797 --> 00:37:06.424
he should… he should share it with us!

535
00:37:06.507 --> 00:37:08.134
I just say we ignore the old man.

536
00:37:08.218 --> 00:37:10.845
We keep moving.
Look for a door or something.

537
00:37:10.929 --> 00:37:13.473
Yeah. and just curious.

538
00:37:13.556 --> 00:37:16.351
This door of yours.
it's soft like a Peanut Butter Bopper?

539
00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.519
You got something to say. Byers.
why don't you say it?

540
00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:21.231
I'm just saying maybe you shouldn't be
making the calls from now on.

541
00:37:21.314 --> 00:37:24.984
It was not just his call.
It was mine because it's my sister.

542
00:37:25.944 --> 00:37:26.945
And…

543
00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.365
I agree with Steve.
Okay. we can't just sit here.

544
00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:34.369
I don't know about a door.
but this wall can't go on forever.

545
00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:36.246
There has to be a way around it.

546
00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:37.372
There isn't.

547
00:37:38.164 --> 00:37:40.500
This wall is a circle.

548
00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:43.169
A circle completely surrounding
the Upside Down.

549
00:37:43.253 --> 00:37:44.671
Oh yeah? How do you figure that?

550
00:37:44.754 --> 00:37:47.423
Because unlike you.
I didn't sleep through Algebra 1.

551
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.846
My telemetry tracker picked up
a weird frequency coming from the wall.

552
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.225
and it took me a bit to place.
but I've heard it before.

553
00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:59.852
Rather. we have.
Remember when we were out looking for Hop.

554
00:37:59.936 --> 00:38:01.604
and you heard that sound
off of Irwin Road?

555
00:38:01.688 --> 00:38:04.148
-Yeah. You said it was interference.
-It was.

556
00:38:04.232 --> 00:38:07.944
But this interference. it wasn't coming
from a military broadcast or an EMI.

557
00:38:08.027 --> 00:38:10.780
It was coming from this wall.
which is important.

558
00:38:10.863 --> 00:38:13.366
because that gives us
three known locations.

559
00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:14.951
So. I connected the dots.

560
00:38:15.034 --> 00:38:17.662
measured the midpoints.
drew the perpendicular bisectors--

561
00:38:17.745 --> 00:38:21.082
All right! Yeah. we're not your teachers.
We don't need to see your work.

562
00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.251
We get it.
You think it's all a big circle.

563
00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:26.629
I don't think. I know. I triple checked.
and my calculations are correct.

564
00:38:26.713 --> 00:38:29.841
Whatever! I still don't see
how this gets us closer to finding Holly.

565
00:38:29.924 --> 00:38:33.136
Because it's not about the circle.
It's about the center.

566
00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:37.765
The DOE. The Department of Energy.

567
00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:40.351
-That's--
-Hawkins Lab.

568
00:38:41.144 --> 00:38:43.187
What are the chances
that the center of this wall

569
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.648
happens to be in the place
where all of this started.

570
00:38:45.732 --> 00:38:47.650
where the Upside Down was created?

571
00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:49.319
So. the lab created the wall?

572
00:38:49.902 --> 00:38:52.655
No idea. But I think we should find out.

573
00:38:53.323 --> 00:38:54.240
Don't you?

574
00:39:01.456 --> 00:39:03.708
The music. it led me to a new memory.

575
00:39:04.292 --> 00:39:07.003
Only. something was different
about this memory.

576
00:39:07.503 --> 00:39:09.589
I was there.

577
00:39:10.965 --> 00:39:12.759
It was the day that Henry cursed me.

578
00:39:13.676 --> 00:39:15.219
It was his first memory of me.

579
00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:19.932
I know. as if this goddamn place
wasn't heady enough. right?

580
00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:23.311
But I still had the music to guide me.

581
00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:25.688
So I followed it.

582
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.818
And it led me through new memories.

583
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.701
Terrible memories.

584
00:39:38.785 --> 00:39:42.080
-Let go!
-Follow me into death.

585
00:39:56.803 --> 00:39:59.097
And it felt like they would never end.

586
00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:05.770
But then eventually. they did.

587
00:40:07.063 --> 00:40:10.024
It was the night that Vecna killed me.

588
00:40:12.819 --> 00:40:14.445
The night he took me prisoner.

589
00:40:15.696 --> 00:40:17.448
Yeah. yeah. yo

590
00:40:17.532 --> 00:40:20.159
Do you wanna know
Know that it doesn't hurt me?

591
00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:21.828
I'd finally found it.

592
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:25.706
Do you wanna hear
About the deal that I'm making?

593
00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:28.543
The way out.

594
00:40:30.586 --> 00:40:34.340
It's you and me

595
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:38.719
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God

596
00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:40.805
And I'd get him to swap…

597
00:40:47.728 --> 00:40:49.313
And I was so close.

598
00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:55.611
So close
that I could feel his hand on mine.

599
00:40:58.448 --> 00:41:00.199
And it was like I was there.

600
00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:04.078
Like I was with him in that hospital.

601
00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:16.632
Come on. Angel
Come on. come on. darling

602
00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:20.386
Let's exchange the experience

603
00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:32.482
No.

604
00:41:33.483 --> 00:41:34.358
No.

605
00:41:39.822 --> 00:41:40.823
Lucas!

606
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:45.870
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

607
00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.500
Hello. Max.

608
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.755
I ran.

609
00:41:58.633 --> 00:41:59.842
And I kept running.

610
00:42:33.042 --> 00:42:35.545
I'll never forget
the look on his face that day.

611
00:42:36.504 --> 00:42:38.464
He was scared.

612
00:42:38.548 --> 00:42:42.176
More than scared. he was terrified.

613
00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.595
There's something about this cave…

614
00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:47.056
this memory.

615
00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.893
He won't come in.

616
00:42:52.687 --> 00:42:53.688
In here.

617
00:42:54.814 --> 00:42:55.815
I'm safe.

618
00:42:56.732 --> 00:42:59.860
So I turned it into my sanctuary.

619
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:04.532
My home.

620
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.619
I took door two.

621
00:43:10.496 --> 00:43:11.747
Shitty door two.

622
00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:15.585
Accept your fate.

623
00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:17.670
That was.

624
00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.214
until you showed up.

625
00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:23.259
And now door three is back.

626
00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:25.845
Escape.

627
00:43:26.512 --> 00:43:29.223
I have a plan.
a plan to get us out of here.

628
00:43:29.932 --> 00:43:33.269
And it's gonna take time.
more time than we have now.

629
00:43:33.352 --> 00:43:35.479
Henry will return to his house soon.

630
00:43:35.563 --> 00:43:38.399
And when he does.
he cannot know that you're gone.

631
00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:40.276
You want me to go back there?

632
00:43:41.235 --> 00:43:42.820
Back to him? Back to Henry? No. I--

633
00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:44.864
I know. It's scary.

634
00:43:44.947 --> 00:43:50.077
But if you wanna get out of here.
if you wanna escape Camazotz.

635
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:52.079
this is the only way.

636
00:43:53.789 --> 00:43:55.041
It's the only way.

637
00:44:00.546 --> 00:44:02.089
Tell me what I need to do.

638
00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:21.901
Hey. wh--

639
00:44:21.984 --> 00:44:23.235
-Hey.
-Hi.

640
00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:30.034
Do you. um. by any chance.
remember Tammy Thompson?

641
00:44:30.117 --> 00:44:32.828
Yeah. Isn't she that terrible singer?

642
00:44:32.912 --> 00:44:34.580
Yeah.

643
00:44:34.664 --> 00:44:36.082
But in the ninth grade.

644
00:44:36.165 --> 00:44:39.794
I thought that she sounded
like Whitney goddamn Houston.

645
00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:45.383
I mean. the first time I saw her.
oh my God. like. time slowed down.

646
00:44:45.466 --> 00:44:47.968
It was like a scene
from some lame-o movie.

647
00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:52.056
You know. her hair blew in the wind.
and she just looked perfect.

648
00:44:52.932 --> 00:44:54.266
So goddamn perfect.

649
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.853
And. uh. it was right then and there
that I knew she was the one.

650
00:44:58.437 --> 00:45:02.900
That with Tammy. I would finally be able
to be myself. you know. all of myself.

651
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.406
Because there was always this part of me
that kind of scared me. you know?

652
00:45:08.489 --> 00:45:12.410
But I thought
that if Tammy loved me. all of me.

653
00:45:12.493 --> 00:45:15.871
you know. I wouldn't be so scared anymore.

654
00:45:15.955 --> 00:45:19.375
And then he showed up.
Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

655
00:45:19.458 --> 00:45:20.918
Oh God.

656
00:45:21.001 --> 00:45:22.670
You probably can guess the rest.

657
00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:25.464
Tammy fell for him hard.

658
00:45:26.048 --> 00:45:31.429
And my entire fantasy life with her.
along with the rest of my life.

659
00:45:31.512 --> 00:45:33.264
pretty much imploded before my eyes.

660
00:45:33.347 --> 00:45:35.516
I mean. my grades plummeted.
I got grounded.

661
00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.685
I had to stay home every weekend
doing chores.

662
00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:41.021
But then one day. I was cleaning bat shit
out of my parents' garage.

663
00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:43.566
and I found this 8-millimeter film reel.
You know?

664
00:45:43.649 --> 00:45:46.944
And it was just from this silly movie
that I made in fourth grade.

665
00:45:47.027 --> 00:45:48.863
but I got it up on the projector.

666
00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:53.784
and all of a sudden. I was looking
at this little version of myself.

667
00:45:53.868 --> 00:45:57.246
And that little me.
I could hardly recognize her.

668
00:45:57.329 --> 00:46:00.583
You know. she was so carefree

669
00:46:01.709 --> 00:46:04.003
and. like. fearless.

670
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.547
She just loved every part of herself.

671
00:46:07.882 --> 00:46:09.133
And that's when it hit me.

672
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.344
It was never about Tone-deaf Tammy.

673
00:46:13.596 --> 00:46:16.807
It was always just about me.

674
00:46:17.516 --> 00:46:19.810
I was looking for answers
in somebody else. but…

675
00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.814
I had all the answers.

676
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.526
I just needed to stop being
so goddamn scared.

677
00:46:28.527 --> 00:46:31.906
Scared of… who I really was.

678
00:46:32.907 --> 00:46:34.950
Once I did that. oh.

679
00:46:36.035 --> 00:46:37.787
I felt so free.

680
00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:42.082
It's like I could fly. you know?
Like. I could finally be…

681
00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:43.542
Rockin' Robin.

682
00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:47.129
Yeah. Rockin' Robin.

683
00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:49.882
Hey. guys!

684
00:46:49.965 --> 00:46:51.425
Take your time. will ya?

685
00:46:56.639 --> 00:46:58.015
Did you finally hit Dick?

686
00:46:58.098 --> 00:46:59.600
-Hit the Dick.
-Yep.

687
00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:01.685
Let's just hope it's not too hard.

688
00:47:01.769 --> 00:47:02.853
If it is.

689
00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:04.939
I'll soften it.

690
00:47:10.653 --> 00:47:11.529
Hey!

691
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.823
Hey!

692
00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.450
Hey!

693
00:47:18.577 --> 00:47:19.912
Take me to Kay.

694
00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:41.851
Damn it! Damn it!

695
00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:49.650
Make a sound. it'll be your last.
Nod if you understand.

696
00:47:52.528 --> 00:47:55.239
Move! Move it! Come on. let's go!

697
00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.074
Come on!

698
00:47:59.159 --> 00:48:00.244
It's not working.

699
00:48:01.453 --> 00:48:03.330
-How do we get through?
-I don't have clearance.

700
00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:06.584
I didn't ask if you have clearance.
I asked. how do we get through?

701
00:48:06.667 --> 00:48:07.793
You can't.

702
00:48:07.877 --> 00:48:11.380
Dr. Kay. your boss. she got clearance?

703
00:48:11.463 --> 00:48:12.506
I don't know.

704
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:14.341
You don't know.

705
00:48:14.842 --> 00:48:16.927
Thanks for your help.

706
00:48:17.595 --> 00:48:18.596
Plan B.

707
00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.122
-Stop! Stop!
-El!

708
00:48:46.498 --> 00:48:48.125
-El!
-Stop!

709
00:49:26.246 --> 00:49:27.539
We're through.

710
00:49:36.423 --> 00:49:37.591
Oh. shit.

711
00:49:58.404 --> 00:49:59.363
Oh. shit.

712
00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:09.581
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

713
00:50:09.665 --> 00:50:11.917
Breathe in and out.

714
00:50:12.001 --> 00:50:14.003
As you continue breathing.

715
00:50:14.086 --> 00:50:16.880
I want you to picture yourself on a beach.

716
00:50:16.964 --> 00:50:20.426
The water is blue. Blue as a Smurf.

717
00:50:20.509 --> 00:50:26.056
You listen to it lap the sandy shore.
like a dog slurping from his bowl.

718
00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:35.190
It's called visualization.

719
00:50:35.274 --> 00:50:37.192
Mom does it when she's out of Valium.

720
00:50:49.621 --> 00:50:50.789
Go.

721
00:51:36.251 --> 00:51:37.169
Howdy.

722
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:47.638
Feel the sand under your butt.
It feels cool and soft.

723
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:49.890
…time. There you go.

724
00:51:50.933 --> 00:51:52.893
Good job. good job. All right.

725
00:51:53.894 --> 00:51:56.688
Hey. sweetie. Um. what's your name?

726
00:51:56.772 --> 00:51:58.190
Debbie.

727
00:51:58.273 --> 00:52:00.025
Do you work for Mr. Whatsit?

728
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:01.235
Mr. Whatsit.

729
00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:04.696
Oh. Um. yes. Of course.
I'm one of his elves.

730
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.574
You know. like a… a magic elf.

731
00:52:24.591 --> 00:52:27.386
Right here. A couple more steps.

732
00:52:27.469 --> 00:52:29.555
All right. Yes. okay.

733
00:52:29.638 --> 00:52:32.766
All right. Great job. Step by step.

734
00:52:48.574 --> 00:52:49.950
Shit.

735
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:27.905
Eleven.

736
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:33.285
I have been looking for you
for a very long time.

737
00:53:35.287 --> 00:53:36.163
My name is--

738
00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:37.331
Dr. Kay.

739
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:41.251
I know who you are.

740
00:53:43.295 --> 00:53:45.339
I know who you've taken.

741
00:53:49.635 --> 00:53:51.094
And I also know…

742
00:53:53.639 --> 00:53:55.224
that you and your men…

743
00:53:57.059 --> 00:53:59.102
are going to die.

744
00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:30.592
What the hell?

745
00:55:35.574 --> 00:55:37.659
It's best not to struggle.

746
00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:43.332
The greater the perceived threat.
the more aggressive its response.

747
00:55:49.254 --> 00:55:51.131
Miss Robin. what about the others?

748
00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.592
Uh. just Robin. And don't worry.
They're right behind us.

749
00:55:53.675 --> 00:55:55.927
-Something's wrong. isn't it?
-No. No. siree.

750
00:55:56.011 --> 00:55:57.888
Everything is going
exactly according to plan.

751
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:01.683
-Airlock-- Wrap it with your jacket.
-I got it.

752
00:56:01.767 --> 00:56:03.727
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

753
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:05.354
Here. Try it--

754
00:56:07.522 --> 00:56:10.275
Hey. Sorry.
Bit of a plumbing problem here.

755
00:56:10.359 --> 00:56:12.235
Are you by chance looking for Mr. Whatsit?

756
00:56:13.528 --> 00:56:15.322
-Right through there.
-Right there.

757
00:56:25.332 --> 00:56:28.335
There's a little breeze
in the air telling you a secret.

758
00:56:29.336 --> 00:56:32.589
You look up at the sky.
searching for clouds. but all you--

759
00:56:50.357 --> 00:56:51.400
Mr. Whatsit?

760
00:56:56.071 --> 00:56:57.197
Shit!

761
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.573
Officer! Officer!

762
00:56:58.657 --> 00:57:00.200
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Hey. calm down.

763
00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:01.410
-What's going on?
-Shitballs.

764
00:57:01.493 --> 00:57:02.327
Good job. man.

765
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:04.955
-Lucas! We've been spotted!
-No. no!

766
00:57:05.038 --> 00:57:06.248
Get 'em out of here. Go.

767
00:57:06.331 --> 00:57:08.375
-What about the others?
-Just go! Go. go. go!

768
00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:09.793
Damn it! Okay. come on. guys.

769
00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:18.427
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

770
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:19.886
Hey. stop right there!

771
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.013
Ashley Klein is a snitch!

772
00:57:24.015 --> 00:57:24.933
Hey!

773
00:57:30.397 --> 00:57:32.566
Open the door! Open the goddamn door!

774
00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.450
So you're the reason.

775
00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:45.662
The reason she's been so hard to track.

776
00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:49.875
The thorn in my side.

777
00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:58.175
And after all that effort to hide her.
you bring her here. of all places?

778
00:57:59.718 --> 00:58:00.719
Why?

779
00:58:01.887 --> 00:58:04.890
Why risk her life for the other?

780
00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.894
What do you know that I don't?

781
00:58:15.901 --> 00:58:19.112
It's actually holding back.
if you can believe it.

782
00:58:19.738 --> 00:58:21.656
That heat you feel…

783
00:58:23.033 --> 00:58:24.576
weakens it.

784
00:58:29.289 --> 00:58:32.501
But in the cold. it thrives.

785
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:38.632
I can stop it.

786
00:58:39.216 --> 00:58:41.134
But you're gonna have to start talking.

787
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.071
Go to hell.

788
00:59:15.794 --> 00:59:18.880
In your current state.
I'm afraid that won't work.

789
00:59:29.683 --> 00:59:31.309
Not the sharpest. are we?

790
00:59:50.912 --> 00:59:53.957
You're too late. Cavalry's on its way.

791
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.458
That's all right.

792
00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.711
I'll be quick.

793
01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.516
Grocery delivery.

794
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.018
Where's everyone else?

795
01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:14.269
Coming.

796
01:00:17.188 --> 01:00:20.900
Come on. sweetie. Come on down. Come on.

797
01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:24.112
You get down here right now.
or a monster's gonna eat you.

798
01:00:26.281 --> 01:00:27.490
Open the door!

799
01:00:27.574 --> 01:00:28.867
You little shit!

800
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:30.243
Get out of the way!

801
01:00:30.744 --> 01:00:31.953
About goddamn time!

802
01:00:41.296 --> 01:00:44.382
I got you. That's good. Good. good.

803
01:00:44.466 --> 01:00:46.843
Hey there.
Where do you think you're going?

804
01:01:00.398 --> 01:01:01.650
What are you doing?

805
01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:05.987
Hey. you gotta go. You gotta go. Come on.

806
01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.451
We're gonna get to the woods.

807
01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.995
The kryptonite shit can't get you there.

808
01:01:14.079 --> 01:01:16.665
Hop. we can't. We can't leave.
We came for Henry.

809
01:01:16.748 --> 01:01:19.959
Hey. You take this compass.
You're gonna follow it northeast.

810
01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:23.338
That'll take you to the graveyard.
You're gonna find Nancy and the others.

811
01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:25.465
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Hey. hey. hey. Hey.

812
01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.466
What is that?

813
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.426
It's just a failsafe. okay?

814
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.011
-It's a failsafe.
-No.

815
01:01:30.095 --> 01:01:31.805
I gotta make sure he goes down with me.

816
01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.516
-No. No. Hop.
-It's the only way. It's the only way.

817
01:01:34.599 --> 01:01:36.685
I'm not gonna risk losing you.

818
01:01:36.768 --> 01:01:37.894
I will not risk it.

819
01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:40.772
-Hopper. No.
-Listen. I want you to know something.

820
01:01:40.855 --> 01:01:42.357
From here on out.

821
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.984
I want you to know how proud I am of you.

822
01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:48.363
I am so proud of you.
I am so proud of what you've overcome.

823
01:01:50.532 --> 01:01:52.033
I'm proud of who you are.

824
01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:53.910
No.

825
01:01:53.993 --> 01:01:57.706
No. No. Hop. Hopper!

826
01:01:57.789 --> 01:02:01.459
-I love you. Jane.
-Hopper! No! Hopper!

827
01:02:08.675 --> 01:02:09.634
Hop!

828
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.970
Hopper!

829
01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:15.390
Hopper!

830
01:02:15.974 --> 01:02:16.933
Hop!

831
01:02:18.017 --> 01:02:19.060
Hopper!

832
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:26.234
Hopper!

833
01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:29.154
Hopper! Hopper!

834
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:31.698
Hopper!

835
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.288
Pulse ox is falling.

836
01:02:40.832 --> 01:02:41.916
Flatlining!

837
01:03:04.564 --> 01:03:07.025
All right. kids. Come on.
Find a seat in the back.

838
01:03:11.404 --> 01:03:12.238
Hi.

839
01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:14.574
All right.

840
01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:17.827
Okay. let's have some fun. huh?
This is gonna be great. huh?

841
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:19.788
Okay. Let's get our seat belts on. hmm?

842
01:03:19.871 --> 01:03:22.665
Safety first. Come on. Time's a-wastin'.

843
01:03:22.749 --> 01:03:23.625
Pretty comfy. huh?

844
01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:25.084
Not really.

845
01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.878
Oh. sorry.

846
01:03:26.961 --> 01:03:29.881
Robin. Lucas. do you copy? Over.

847
01:03:29.964 --> 01:03:30.882
Copy. It's Robin.

848
01:03:30.965 --> 01:03:32.050
Lucas. I copy.

849
01:03:33.468 --> 01:03:35.136
We've got a problem here at the MAC.

850
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.387
What kind of problem?

851
01:03:36.471 --> 01:03:38.556
Let go of me. you asshole!

852
01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.685
You want to explain to me
what in God's name is going on here?

853
01:03:42.769 --> 01:03:43.937
Get the hell off me.

854
01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.773
-We've got five missing kids. sir.
-You've lost five kids?

855
01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.191
-How is that possible?
-This woman--

856
01:03:48.274 --> 01:03:49.359
Joyce Byers.

857
01:03:49.442 --> 01:03:50.735
She broke into the barracks.

858
01:03:50.819 --> 01:03:53.488
She's been helping them escape
through some kind of tunnel.

859
01:03:53.571 --> 01:03:55.406
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

860
01:03:55.490 --> 01:04:00.078
Listen. These kids. they are not safe.
okay? They are in danger.

861
01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:02.455
And why exactly do you think
they're here. ma'am? Hmm?

862
01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:03.915
They're under our protection.

863

910
01:12:46.854 --> 01:12:47.813
Murray!

911
01:12:49.857 --> 01:12:51.400
Son of a bitch!

Stay away from him! You stay away!

919
01:15:12.082 --> 01:15:13.709
Can you see them…

920
01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:16.086
William?

921
01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:21.091
Can you see the children?

922
01:15:21.675 --> 01:15:23.511
Do you know why?

923
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.768
Why I chose them to reshape the world?

924
01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:38.400
It's because they are weak.

925
01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:47.451
Weak in body and mind.

926
01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.083
Please!

927
01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:56.585
Easily broken.

928
01:15:57.962 --> 01:16:00.130
Easily reshaped.

929
01:16:01.549 --> 01:16:03.008
Controlled.

930
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.305
The perfect vessels.

931
01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:11.892
And you…

932
01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:13.978
Will.

933
01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:16.939
You were the first.

934
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:24.863
And you broke so easily.

935
01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:35.749
You showed me what was possible.

936
01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:38.127
what I could achieve.

937
01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:43.132
Some minds. it turns out.

938
01:16:44.341 --> 01:16:47.052
simply do not belong in this world.

939
01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:57.021
They belong in mine.

940
01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:49.156
I was looking for the answers
in somebody else. but…

941
01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:51.659
I had all the answers.

Do you wanna be friends?

944
01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.096
I just…

945
01:18:13.013 --> 01:18:16.975
needed to stop being so goddamn scared.

946
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.985
Scared of who I really was.

947
01:18:31.281 --> 01:18:33.575
Wow! It's so good!

948
01:18:59.017 --> 01:19:00.644
And once I did that.

949
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:02.646
I was so free.

950
01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:05.399
It's like I could fly.
