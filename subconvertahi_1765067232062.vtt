Rozanov! Is there something
more important going on?

3
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.450
You listen. Don't speak.
You understand?

4
00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:44.617
Yes.

5
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.575
THE COLONEL

6
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.709
What the fuck is going on?
Why is Dad calling me?

7
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.087
<i>Baby brother.
happy New Year for you. right?</i>

8
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.839
Happy New Year. Alexei. but...

9
00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.424
How's it going. handsome boy?

10
00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.426
<i>What is going on with Dad?</i>

11
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.803
What the fuck are you talking about?
Dad is fine.

12
00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.514
<i>He keeps calling me.</i>

13
00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.600
'Cause you lost
a fucking hockey game. idiot.

14
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.561
What the fuck
do you want from me. Alexei?

15
00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.730
<i>Let me think about it!</i>

16
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.316
Can I have more money?

17
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.943
<i>Please...</i>

18
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.444
I have no more money. Alexei!

19
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:14.989
My bonus is done. man.
You snorted most of it!

20
00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:18.826
<i>Wah-wah. you whiny faggot.</i>

21
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:20.286
Go fuck yourself.

22
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.163
Go fuck yourself. bitch.

23
00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:31.756
Hello. Father.

24
00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.342
<i>And so he answers!</i>

25
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.510
I'm sorry. Father.

26
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.387
<i>Apologize to Russia.</i>

27
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.890
<i>Losing to the Czechs. Disgusting.</i>

28
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.225
We will beat Sweden. Father.

29
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.601
<i>Beat Sweden?</i>

30
00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:45.270
<i>You will have to!
Otherwise. you will...</i>

31
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.855
Not play for good. I know. Father.

32
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.775
We are all trying.

33
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.610
<i>I don't care about "we"!</i>

34
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.988
<i>You! You will not lose to him.</i>

35
00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:08.598
<i>But a goal off the face-off?
Your first against Rozanov?</i>

36
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.392
<i>That had to have felt pretty good?</i>

37
00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.769
<i>I'm happy with any goal I can get.</i>

38
00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.521
<i>But one off of Rozanov?</i>

39
00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.274
<i>Again. I'm happy with any goal.</i>

40
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:18.775
<i>And the face-offs?</i>

41
00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:22.195
<i>I'm here for the team.
I'm here to win.</i>

42
00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:23.947
<i>I don't care about the details.</i>

43
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.451
<i>And what do you think about being compared
to Tiger Woods and Serena Williams?</i>

44
00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:30.370
<i>Do you think you share
any of the same challenges?</i>

45
00:30:31.538 --> 00:30:33.582
<i>I don't really think
about stuff like that.</i>

46
00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:36.376
<i>I'm just super happy
to play for the Metros.</i>

47
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.381
How does it feel to be perfect?

48
00:30:41.464 --> 00:30:42.466
Fucking perfect.

49
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.509
Thanks for asking.

50
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:48.096
In fucking French.

51
00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.599
Twenty thousand dollars?

52
00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.350
<i>Yes. twenty thousand dollars.</i>

53
00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:56.021
I'm glad your hearing is OK.

54
00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:57.189
For what this time?

55
00:30:57.272 --> 00:30:59.023
For fuck you.

56
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.277
This is the last fucking time.

57
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.820
Yeah. fine.

58
00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:05.447
And I'm not sending it tonight!

59
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.615
<i>Why the fuck not?</i>

60
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.825
It's... It's midnight here. Alexei.

61
00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:11.661
You always have
some bullshit excuse. Ilya.

62
00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:14.664
How's Dad?

63
00:31:14.747 --> 00:31:17.375
<i>What the fuck is up with you and Dad?</i>

64
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:18.919
Jesus fucking Christ!
He is fine!

65
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:20.754
We can all live without you.

66
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.338
Go fuck yourself. Ilya.

67
00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:29.429
On the phone yesterday.
he asked me to bring home some bread.

68
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.808
Well. he is stupid!

69
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:40.023
Good night. Alexei.

70
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.567
First thing in the morning. Ilya.

71
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:57.243
Come on!

72
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:22.748
Jesus Christ.

73
00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:24.459
-Surprise!
-Svetlana!

74
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.835
I thought you were back in Russia!

75
00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:28.463
What the fuck are you doing here?

76
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:31.591
Being nice. but I already regret it.

77
00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:33.134
Sounds like you.

78
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.094
Go fuck yourself. Ilya.

79
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:39.640
Sorry. I didn't expect you.

80
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:42.185
-How did you know...
-That your game was cancelled?

81
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:44.144
It was announced. asshole.

82
00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:48.232
You don't deserve me. I should go.

83
00:42:52.444 --> 00:42:54.822
OK. now I'm really leaving.
