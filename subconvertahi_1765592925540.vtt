00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:23.333
Good. Send a message.

528
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:24.791
He got busted and told the vice principal.

Kevin.

530
00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.166
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

531
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:37.000
- I know. you're disappointed.
- I am disappointed.

you do it quietly.

You go in through a back door.
no fingerprints.

535
00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:44.041
But more importantly.
the second this kid Kevin

536
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.666
knew what you were doing.
you got a loose end.

537
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.833
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

538
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:53.375
And never let someone get the upper hand
on you. 'cause they'll use it.

539
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:57.791
Yeah.

540
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.125
All right. I got to go practice.

541
00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:11.208
I have this dumb winter pageant thing
tonight for jazz band.

542
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:13.500
A pageant? Oof.

543
00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:15.166
I know.

544
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.125
I said it was dumb.

545
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.250
Good luck.

546
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.750

- [Dylan] I know.

547
00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:28.583
- Thought labor wasn't progressing.
- Yeah. then it did.

548
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.541
Thanks for picking him up. though.

549
00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:33.333
I don't know what's going on
with him these days. He's acting out.

550
00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:35.750
Yeah. well. you know. growing up is tough.

551
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.666
Is that why you're avoiding it?

552
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.041
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

553
00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:41.625
Yeah.

554
00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:43.125
He'd really love to see you
more often. Jack.

555
00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:44.583
I just picked him up.

556
00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:46.666
- I know.
- It was really nice. We had a good talk.

557
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.666
He told me about school.
I mean. I don't know what...

558
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.625
He would love that to happen more often.
is all I'm saying.

559
00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:51.958
I got to go to work.

Now let's see if it works.

Who do you have in mind. Mum?

Well. it was nice to meet you. Cal.

886
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.958
Good luck with everything.

Thank you so much.

888
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:39.958
I'm just gonna live here now.

889
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.958
- Gonna marry her.
- Why don't you focus?

890
00:50:42.041 --> 00:50:44.125
We got to find your guy.

891
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:46.625
Not a lot of fun. are you. Cal?

892
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.875
Oh. I'm fun.

893
00:50:49.958 --> 00:50:52.916
As a matter of fact. I won the prize

[Callum] I would suggest
you give it a shot.

899
00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:09.333
I see the worst in everyone. Cal.

00:51:09.416 --> 00:51:10.916
It's my gift.

901

See. look at this guy.

904
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:20.333
He's married but not to her.

905
00:51:20.416 --> 00:51:22.666
That's why he has a tan line
where his wedding ring should be.

- This guy's about to screw over that guy.

That's the guy we're looking for.

He's a good kid.

1226
01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.875
Yeah. I know he's a good kid.

1227
01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:17.208
It's not what you think.
His mother and I were never together.

1228
01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:19.541
I mean. I'm his father.
but I've never been his dad.

1229
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.375
She's a doctor now.
and she's married to a really good guy.

1230
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:28.416
and he is a good dad.
so the last thing the kid needs is. like.

who's got nothing to offer him. so...

1233
01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.833
Honestly. the best thing I can do
for the kid is keep some distance

1234
01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:42.125
so I don't get in the way
and he's not disappointed all the time.

1235

Uh-huh.

1236
01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.291

1244

Red gave gifts to well-behaved children.

1245
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.500
and the brother helped keep track
of who they were.

1246
01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:44.583
Then the brother started making lists.

1247
01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:47.291
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1248
01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:50.833
He didn't like the idea of a running list
of misbehaved children.

1249
01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:54.291
But the brother became obsessed.

1250
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.708
So you're saying Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1251
01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.833
Yes.

1252
01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:04.375
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1253
01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:07.750
Red was furious.

1254
01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:12.625
So he took the list away.
and the brother never forgave him.

1255
01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.625
He went out on his own.
eventually hooking up with the Witch.

01:18:12.791 --> 01:18:14.833
[others join in laughter]

1397
01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:17.875
Last night. he was taken
from the compound by the Witch.

1398
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:21.208
And I know that she was here not long ago.

1399
01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:25.666
Are you accusing me of something. Drift?

1400
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:28.708
You and she were partners once.

1401
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.666
Roaming the countryside. the villages.

1402
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.166
Punishing people.

1403
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.916
Yes.

1404
01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.666
But back then. she was glorious.

1405
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.000
[laughter]

1406
01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:41.166
An ogre 18 feet high.

1407
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.333
The skin of an elephant.

1408
01:18:43.416 --> 01:18:46.625
Giant pair of tails.

1409
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:52.041
And yes. punishing as the cruelest winter.

1410
01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.958
We had some wonderful times together.

1411
01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.708
But I gave up that work. remember?

1412
01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:05.000
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty.

1413
01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:08.041
trying to scare them into decency.

1414
01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:10.000
I did my part!

1415
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.583
The only punishing I do now...

1416
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:18.333
- ...is for fun.
- [laughter]

1417
01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:20.250
Like my good friend over here...

1418
01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:24.500
- [groans softly]
- ...enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

1419
01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:26.291
But today is not Krampusnacht.

1420
01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:29.333
In this house. Northerner.

1421
01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:33.625
- it is always Krampusnacht!
- [cheering]

1422
01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.583
[crowd chanting] Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah!

1423
01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:38.208
- Ah. ah. ah! Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!
- [Krampus shouting]

1424
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:40.083
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1425
01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:43.500
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1426
01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:45.833
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah! Ooh. ah. ooh. ah!

1427
01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:48.166
- Krampus!
- Ah. ah. ah! Ooh...

1428
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.250
[chanting stops]

1429
01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.500
Why was she here?

1430
01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:53.500
- [flame whooshes]
- [goblet shatters]

1431
01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:56.875
Many years ago. she gave me a gift.

1432
01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.166
She came because she wanted it back.

1433
01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.541
A gift? What gift?

1434
01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:03.791
The Glaskäfig.

1435
01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:07.458
On its face. a simple glass snow globe.

1436
01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:11.166
but its true purpose is nefarious.

1437
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.000
Tremendously punishing.

1438
01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:16.041
She wants to punish them all.

1439
01:20:16.125 --> 01:20:19.750
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

1440
01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:22.125
A prison for but one.

1441
01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.791
Krampus. I need to find him.

1442
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.750
Let me go.

1443
01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:36.083
And why...

1444
01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:38.166
would I do that?

1445
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.833
Because we need him.

1446
01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.541
Now more than ever. we need him.

1447
01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.041
And you know that.

1448
01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:53.166
Let me go.

1449
01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.125
Northerner.

1450
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:07.500
You are not going anywhere.

1451
01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.541
You. get out.

1452
01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:14.208
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1453
01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:17.583
There is a price for this intrusion.

1454
01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:20.875
Now and forever.

1455
01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:23.208
Drift belongs to me.

1456
01:21:24.708 --> 01:21:26.750
[laughter]

1457
01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:28.708
So I can...

1458
01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.500
just walk out of here?

1459
01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:32.833
I suggest you run.

1460
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.958
You'll learn to love it here.

1461
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.708
Take him away.

1462
01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:43.875
[crowd murmuring. laughing]

1463
01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:47.416
Wait. Uh. wait. wait. wait. wait.
Uh. sorry. Wait.

1464
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.041
Um. uh. L-Lord... uh. Mister...

1465
01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:51.958
Lord Krampus. um...

1466
01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.541
you and I aren't so different.

1467
01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:01.000
We're pretty different. but I think
we have some things in common.

1468
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.416
Ah. Do you. now?

1469
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.708
Yeah.

1470
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:07.583
I mean. you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1471
01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:08.875
Bit of a gambler?

1472
01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.375
Well. so am I.

1473
01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:14.833
Now. when we came in here. my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

1474
01:22:14.916 --> 01:22:17.833
at your game. uh. Krampusschlap.

1475
01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:19.833
- What?
- [laughter]

1476
01:22:19.916 --> 01:22:23.000
Now. initially. I said. "No way."

1477
01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.833
But the more I see him getting riled up.
I'm starting to like my odds.

1478
01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:28.541
so just hear me out.

1479
01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:31.625
If you win. we go to your dungeon forever.

1480
01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:34.708
If he wins. we walk.

1481
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.750
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

1482
01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.583
I mean. I get that. He's a big guy.

1483
01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:41.250
No shame.

1484
01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:42.625
Lot of people watching.

1485
01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:50.583
Imbeciles.

1486
01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:52.750
- I love it.
- [crowd cheering]

1487
01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.458
- Oh.

[cheering]

1493
01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1494
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.250
[cheering dies down]

1495
01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:20.291
The rules are as follows:

1496
01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.708
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

1497
01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:27.500
The first to be knocked out or die loses.

1498
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.541
First touch.

1499
01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:36.250
That's you.

1500
01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:37.875
[sighs]

1501
01:23:37.958 --> 01:23:39.958
[quiet. tense music playing]

1502
01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.500
You know. I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

1503
01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:52.541
- [crowd groaning]
- Come on.

1504
01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:54.416
I'm sure you do.

1505
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.916
He's still your brother.

1506
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.625
And he never gave up on you.

1507
01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.041
What would you know about it?

1508
01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:03.958
I know him.

1509
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:09.625
Take your best "schlap."

Interesting.

1514
01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.500
My turn.

1515
01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:32.250
[cheering]

1516

[grunts]

1517
01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.583
I could be merciful

1518
01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:41.291
and kill him on the first touch.

1519
01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:44.500
But what fun would that be. huh?
[chuckles]

1520

Hey. buddy. You okay?

1529
01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.750
He just slapped the shit out of me.

1530
01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.125
Yeah. that was so embarrassing.

1531
01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:20.166
I love this game!

1532
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.291
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I...

1533

[Jack] Just get up. Trust me.

1534

[whimpering] I can't...

Yeah. sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

01:35:47.958 --> 01:35:49.958
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1746
01:35:50.041 --> 01:35:52.041
[mysterious music playing]

1747
01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:58.875
- [Zoe] Remember. can't trust anyone.
- [device beeping]

1748
01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:02.083
- [wind whistling]
- I've got a signal.

1749
01:36:02.166 --> 01:36:04.041
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1750
01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.875
- We're close.
- [Fred] Hey. chief.

1751
01:36:11.375 --> 01:36:12.958
Fred?

1752
01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:17.166
- I'll let the team know that you're back.
- How about you don't?

1753
01:36:22.083 --> 01:36:23.500
[Zoe] Shape-shifters.

1754
01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:26.166
Good tidings.

1755
01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:28.583
[device continues beeping]

1756
01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:34.041
[Zoe] It says he should be right here.

1757
01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:39.416
The old tunnel system.

1758
01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.041
Runs right beneath the original workshop.

1759
01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:44.125
Let's go.

1760
01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:45.916
[shuddering breaths]

1761
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.583
Is this happening because I was ditching?

1762
01:36:47.666 --> 01:36:48.708
What?

1763
01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:50.041
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1764
01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:52.208
No. no. no. no. no. no. Dylan.

1765
01:36:52.291 --> 01:36:53.625
You said it was for naughty people.
didn't you?

1766
01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:55.083
Well. she said that. but...

1767
01:36:55.166 --> 01:36:56.791
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1768
01:36:56.875 --> 01:36:58.291
Look at me.

1769
01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:02.583
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1770
01:37:02.666 --> 01:37:05.708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1771
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.000
You're only in here be...

1772
01:37:10.083 --> 01:37:11.916
because of me.

1773
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:14.708
What did you do?

1774
01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:17.208
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1775
01:37:17.291 --> 01:37:19.625
It's... long list.

1776
01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:23.958
But bigger than any of that.
it's what I didn't do.

1777
01:37:24.041 --> 01:37:25.875
What are you talking about?

1778
01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.208
I've been a terrible father.

1779
01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:38.875
- That's not true.
- Yes. it is. It is.

1780
01:37:38.958 --> 01:37:40.583
I haven't been around.

1781
01:37:40.666 --> 01:37:43.625
I told myself I was doing you a favor.
which is bullshit.

1782
01:37:43.708 --> 01:37:47.166
It was bad for you.
and it was terrible for me.

1783
01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:51.333
I've made some mistakes. pal. I know that.

1784
01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:53.750
But I also know that I can do better.

1785
01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.958
And I know that's easier said than done.

1786
01:37:57.041 --> 01:38:00.625
I know it's a lot of work.
and I hope it's not too late.

1787
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.791
Every day.
every decision is an opportunity.

1788
01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:13.500
And I want to start taking some of those.

1789
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.958
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

1790
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:20.625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

1791
01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:24.541
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world.

1792
01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:27.291
but I know I can do better.

1793
01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:30.833
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1794
01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:33.125
I will never stop trying.

1795
01:38:33.208 --> 01:38:35.208
[gentle. sentimental music playing]

1796
01:38:36.333 --> 01:38:38.000

01:38:47.833 --> 01:38:50.666
[both breathing heavily]

1799
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:54.416
[sighs heavily]

1800
01:38:56.708 --> 01:38:59.125
[sighs]

1801
01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.208
What just happened?

1802
01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1803
01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:10.541
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1804
01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:13.333
First. we got to find somebody. Come on.

1805
01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:15.416
[intriguing music playing]

1806
01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:22.250
[both grunt]

1807
01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:23.333
Ow.

1808
01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:25.291
[sighs] Cal.

1809
01:39:26.833 --> 01:39:30.000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now. what would it be?

1810
01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.750
Wonder Woman.

1811
01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.000
It's him.

1812
01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:35.250
You all right?

1813
01:39:35.333 --> 01:39:37.375
Yeah. Yeah.

1814
01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:38.916
It's good to see you.

1815
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.916
[Dylan] Dad?

1816
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.291
[Jack] Buddy. come here.

1817
01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:44.791
I want you to meet some friends.

1818
01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:47.958
Cal. Zoe. this is my son Dylan.

1819
01:39:48.041 --> 01:39:49.833
The one and only Dylan.

1820
01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:51.250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

1821
01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:54.916
Welcome to the North Pole.

1822
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.250
Huh?

1823
01:39:57.333 --> 01:40:00.000
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

1824
01:40:00.083 --> 01:40:01.833
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

1825
01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:04.250
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds.

1826
01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:06.250
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1827
01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.416
Cal. we saw her.

1828
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

1829
01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:11.375
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1830
01:40:11.458 --> 01:40:12.541
to everybody on the list.

1831
01:40:12.625 --> 01:40:15.291
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1832
01:40:15.375 --> 01:40:16.541
Without him.

1833
01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:18.125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

1834
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.750
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

- [faint shouting]
- [muffled banging]

1836

Ma'am.

1843
01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:43.500

Gryla. stop!

01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:26.291
[Gryla] I was just leaving.

there's worse ways to go out

1905
