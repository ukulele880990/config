<i>We are 24 hours to Christmas Eve.</i>

355
00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:52.750
- <i>We cannot...</i>
- Yes. I'm well aware.

356
00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:57.083
<i>Okay. Okay. let's take a deep breath.</i>

357
00:26:58.458 --> 00:26:59.916
<i>Start from the beginning.</i>

358
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.583
They cut a hole in the CF Dome
using an atomic plasma torch.

359
00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:06.958
From the footprints. I'd say
there's eight to ten of them... human.

360
00:27:07.041 --> 00:27:09.208
They rolled in
on a remote armored snowcat.

361
00:27:09.291 --> 00:27:11.541
which they used as a diversion
before they blasted out of here

362
00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:13.083
in a NORAD-blind cargo jet.

363
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.375
<i>Good God. Cal.</i>

364
00:27:14.458 --> 00:27:15.958
I'm gonna find 'em. Zoe.

365
00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:17.750
<i>We're gonna work together on this.</i>

366
00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:20.791
<i>We were just told that someone hacked</i>

367
00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:22.333
<i>the Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.</i>

368
00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:25.166
<i>I don't know if it's related.
but if someone knew where to look.</i>

369
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.166
<i>that's the only vulnerability
in the cloaking.</i>

370
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.791
Who?

371
00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:31.333
<i>We don't know yet.
The trolls are scouring the Web.</i>

372
00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:33.208
Name and address.

373
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:34.458
<i>They're working on it.</i>

374
00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:37.041
Then tell 'em to work faster.
We don't have time for this.

375
00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:39.375
Director. the trolls have a trace.

376
00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:40.750
<i>Patch them in.</i>

377
00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:42.250
<i>What have you got?</i>

378
00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:43.416
<i>We traced the relays.</i>

379
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.583
<i>Looks like The Wolf.</i>

380
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:48.083
<i>The Wolf.</i>

381
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.250
Who the hell is The Wolf?

382
00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:53.750
<i>Mercenary. bounty hunter.
works for the highest bidder.</i>

383
00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:55.625
<i>A ghost on the dark web.</i>

384
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:58.791
<i>FBI's been trying to recruit him
for years. but he's a freelancer.</i>

385
00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:02.291
<i>He's probably
the best tracker in the world.</i>

386
00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.458
<i>The guy's a legend.</i>

387
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:19.458
What?

388
00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:21.291
Nice. Are you in town?

389
00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:22.458
<i>That depends.</i>

390
00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:24.291
- What do you want?
- <i>I need you to do me a favor</i>

391
00:28:24.375 --> 00:28:25.625
and go pick up Dylan.

392
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:27.333
<i>I'm right in the middle
of something important.</i>

393
00:28:27.416 --> 00:28:29.083
This isn't a good time for me.

394
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:30.375
<i>Yeah. Me. either.</i>

395
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:32.458
I have two mothers-to-be
with weakening contractions

396
00:28:32.541 --> 00:28:34.666
and labor that's not progressing.
and Craig's out of town.

397
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.166
Liv.

398
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.333
Dylan got in trouble at school.

399
00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:39.708
I just need you to go pick him up
and drop him off at my place.

400
00:28:39.791 --> 00:28:41.083
- Liv.
- <i>Jack.</i>

401
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:42.583
I'm stuck at work. and Craig's away.

402
00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:45.000
so just do me a favor
and go pick up your kid.

403
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:01.333
I got it.

404
00:29:01.416 --> 00:29:02.666
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

405
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:06.041
Hey. buddy.

406
00:29:09.458 --> 00:29:11.583
- Hey. you got any aspirin?
- What?

407
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.541
No.

408
00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.083
<i>I got to get
something in my stomach.</i>

409
00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.958
- You want a churro?
- No.

410
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.125
Shut up!

411
00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.083
Hey. man. Can I get two?

412
00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:29.916
- I don't want a churro.
- I heard you. They're for me.

413
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.791
So. what are they saying you did?

414
00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:37.416
Tampered with the school's
attendance records. which I did.

415
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.208
Allegedly.

416
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:41.083
Never admit that.

417
00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:42.500
Thank you. Have a good day.

418
00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:44.500
Yeah. yeah.

419
00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:50.458
The music teacher leaves his computer open
during fifth period.

420
00:29:50.541 --> 00:29:51.916
Mm-hmm.

421
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.916
I started to ditch science
so I could go and practice guitar.

422
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.166
then I'd change it on the computer.

423
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.666
Makes sense.

424
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.916
There's this girl in jazz band. Piper.

425
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.625
She started to ditch with me.
but then Kevin...

426
00:30:02.708 --> 00:30:03.916
Who's Kevin?

427
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.958
My best friend. At least he was.

428
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:07.375
What'd Kevin do?

429
00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:09.125
Kevin found out and wanted to ditch. too.

430
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.750
But he's not even in jazz band.

431
00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:12.458
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

432
00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:14.250
I was the one hanging out with Piper.

433
00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:16.541
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

434
00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:19.041
- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

435
00:30:19.125 --> 00:30:21.125
So. instead.
I gave him three more absents.

436
00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:23.333
Good. Send a message.

437
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:24.791
He got busted and told the vice principal.

438
00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:26.500
Kevin.

439
00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.166
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

440
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:37.000
- I know. you're disappointed.
- I am disappointed.

441
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.041
Look. if you're gonna hack a mainframe.
you do it quietly.

442
00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:41.583
You go in through a back door.
no fingerprints.

443
00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:44.041
But more importantly.
the second this kid Kevin

444
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.666
knew what you were doing.
you got a loose end.

445
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.833
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

446
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:53.375
And never let someone get the upper hand
on you. 'cause they'll use it.

447
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:57.791
Yeah.

448
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.125
All right. I got to go practice.

449
00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:11.208
I have this dumb winter pageant thing
tonight for jazz band.

450
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:13.500
A pageant? Oof.

451
00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:15.166
I know.

452
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.125
I said it was dumb.

453
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.250
Good luck.

454
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.750
- We're gonna talk when I come in.
- I know.

455
00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:28.583
- Thought labor wasn't progressing.
- Yeah. then it did.

456
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.541
Thanks for picking him up. though.

457
00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:33.333
I don't know what's going on
with him these days. He's acting out.

458
00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:35.750
Yeah. well. you know. growing up is tough.

459
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.666
Is that why you're avoiding it?

460
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.041
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

461
00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:41.625
Yeah.

462
00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:43.125
He'd really love to see you
more often. Jack.

463
00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:44.583
I just picked him up.

464
00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:46.666
- I know.
- It was really nice. We had a good talk.

465
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.666
He told me about school.
I mean. I don't know what...

466
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.625
He would love that to happen more often.
is all I'm saying.

467
00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:51.958
I got to go to work.

468
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.500
Okay.

469
00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:57.000
Merry Christmas. Jack.

470
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.416
Yeah.

471
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.166

Hi. Jack.

480
00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:50.000
We know what you did.

481
00:34:50.083 --> 00:34:51.625
Huh?

482
00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:53.250
We know what you did.

483
00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:00.666
Okay. Um...

484
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.041
First of all. sorry.

485
00:35:06.208 --> 00:35:09.041
Second. could you be more specific?

486
00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:11.625
Honestly. you could be talking
about 12 different things right now.

487
00:35:11.708 --> 00:35:13.125
Who are you working for?

488
00:35:14.708 --> 00:35:16.833
Lady. I don't know
what you're talking about.

489
00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:18.583
I work for whoever pays me.

490
00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:19.958
You have about 40 seconds

491
00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:22.333
to become helpful
before you have a terrible accident.

492
00:35:22.416 --> 00:35:24.666
so I'm gonna ask you one more time:

493
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.916
Who hired you to find him?

494
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.458
- Find who?
- You know who.

495
00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:30.041
I promise you I don't.

496
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:31.541
If I did. I would tell you.

497
00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:33.791
I'm not a scrupulous person.
You can ask anybody.

498
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.875
The Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.

499
00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:39.083
Sound familiar?

500
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:43.958
Yeah. I did that.

501
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.166
It was a weird job.

502
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.250
Somebody was trying to find someone
who was running tests

503
00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:50.208
on some weapons systems
in the arctic. and I...

504
00:35:50.291 --> 00:35:52.375
I found the location. and I walked.

505
00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:53.666
For who?

506
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.041
I don't know.

507
00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:58.208
I'm telling you. all the communication
is encrypted and untraceable.

508
00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:59.958
That's how it's supposed to be

509
00:36:00.041 --> 00:36:02.916
so if someone like you shows up
I don't have any answers.

510
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.458
Look. I don't ask questions.

511
00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:07.750
I just find people
that no one else can find.

512
00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:09.291
It's what I do.

513
00:36:14.125 --> 00:36:16.791
You really don't know what you did.

514
00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:19.166
I guess not.

515
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.458
I mean. I can tell
you're very upset about it. though.

516
00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:27.333
Box him up.

517
00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:28.875
Box me up?

518
00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:30.458
Wait. wait. What do you mean? Hey.

519
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.750
Is this really necessary?

520
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.791
Ow.

521
00:37:03.041 --> 00:37:04.291
Cool place.

522
00:37:04.375 --> 00:37:06.500
How long you been here?

523
00:37:07.666 --> 00:37:08.791
M-O-R-A?

524
00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:10.250
MORA.

525
00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:12.750
The Mythological Oversight
and Restoration Authority.

526
00:37:12.833 --> 00:37:14.333
Come again?

527
00:37:14.416 --> 00:37:16.375
We are the multilateral
international organization

528
00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:19.625
responsible for securing and protecting
the mythological world.

529
00:37:21.708 --> 00:37:22.833
Come with me.

530
00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.250
- Did you say "the mythological world"?
- Yes.

531
00:37:27.333 --> 00:37:29.375
Right.

532
00:37:29.458 --> 00:37:33.125
So. uh. bigfoot.

533
00:37:33.208 --> 00:37:35.750
Loch Ness Monster. that kind of thing?

534
00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:37.083
That kind of thing.

535
00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:39.500
Okay. so...

536
00:37:39.583 --> 00:37:42.666
things that don't actually exist.
you guys are responsible for.

537
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.041
Got it.

538
00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:47.166
Holy shit!

539
00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:03.208
If he knows anything. he ain't talking.

540
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:05.791
All right. Horse back to the pen.
body back to Area 32.

541
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:07.916
And get the pumpkin
back in the cryo-vault stat.

542
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.500
Yes. Director.

543
00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:11.125
What the hell was that?

544
00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:12.416
The Horseman.

545
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.958
We're questioning all the usual suspects.

546
00:38:16.541 --> 00:38:18.875
The Headless Horseman?

547
00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:22.666
Hey. What did that
Taser thing do to my head?

548
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.875
It's not a Taser. It's an Acquiescer.

549
00:38:24.958 --> 00:38:27.833
Just take a deep breath
and have a seat. Jack.

550
00:38:46.833 --> 00:38:48.458
What am I doing here?

551
00:38:50.916 --> 00:38:54.541
Last night. at roughly 11:00 p.m. NPST.

552
00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:58.375
Red One. also known
as Saint Nicholas of Myra.

553
00:38:58.458 --> 00:39:01.291
was abducted from the North Pole complex.

554
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.958
The data you retrieved from the I-Triple-S
was used to pinpoint the location.

555
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:12.166
which has been secure and classified
for several hundred years.

556
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.166
Use your words.

557
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.541
Are you saying...

558
00:39:25.625 --> 00:39:29.166
Santa Claus has been kidnapped?

559
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.708
And you think I had
something to do with it?

560
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:33.000
Where is he?

561
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.375
Is that him?

562
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:43.041
Jack "The Wolf" O'Malley.
meet Callum Drift. commander of the E.L.F.

563
00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:45.541
The E.L.F.?

564
00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:47.291
Turns out Jack here didn't know
what he was doing.

565
00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:50.500
Somebody hired him to find the complex.
and incredibly. he did.

566
00:39:50.583 --> 00:39:51.916
Who?

567
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.625
- He doesn't know.
- I don't know.

568
00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:55.875
- Yes. he does.
- No. he doesn't.

569
00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:57.833
They always know something.

570
00:39:57.916 --> 00:40:00.041
Sometimes you just
got to shake it out of 'em.

571
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.125
I'm not gonna like you.

572
00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:06.125
I can tell right away. out of
everyone here. I like you the least.

573
00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:08.625
Garcia.

574
00:40:12.875 --> 00:40:14.958
What the...

575
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:16.625
Yeah. chief.

576
00:40:16.708 --> 00:40:18.500
- This guy's not cooperating.
- Ah.

577
00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:20.250
Should we do the thing?

578
00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:21.750
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

579
00:40:21.833 --> 00:40:23.666
- Cal. let's talk about this for a minute.
- There's nothing to talk about.

580
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.416
You can't trust this guy.
He's on the list.

581
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.500
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

582
00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:29.583
Look. I'm not on any watch list.
I know for a fact that...

583
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.666
Wait a minute.

584
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.833
You don't mean...

585
00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:35.958
Yes. that list. You're on it. I checked.

586
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:37.791
- NL-Four.
- Are you telling me

587
00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:41.041
this clown is a Level Four Naughty Lister?

588
00:40:41.125 --> 00:40:44.625
- A Level Four Naughty Lister?
- Oh. is that funny to you?

589
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.625
Hey. hey. hey. What are we doing here?

590
00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:48.416
- Come on.
- I know this is killing you.

591
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.750
but you have to trust me.

592
00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:51.291
Dismembering this shit bag
isn't gonna help.

593
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:53.916
It would feel good. but it won't help.

594
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.125
I'm right here.

595
00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:56.208
Shut up.

596
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:00.583
- What are you thinking?
- We're gonna put him to work.

597
00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:03.166
- No. absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

598
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.791
You said you work for whoever pays you.

599
00:41:05.875 --> 00:41:06.875
Today that's me.

600
00:41:06.958 --> 00:41:08.833
He's not telling us everything he knows.
Look at him.

601
00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:10.125
He is telling us
everything he knows.

602
00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:11.416
He just doesn't know who hired him.

603
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.958
Well. I mean.
how much are we talking here?

604
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:17.666
Garcia.

605
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.958
Okay.

606
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:22.458
Okay. I don't know who it was.
but I can figure out where they are.

607
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:24.833
Or where they were last night.

608
00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.833
God.

609
00:41:30.625 --> 00:41:34.208
Look. it is anonymous...
I don't know who it is...

610
00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:38.916
but in my line of work. I need insurance.
you know. in case of billing issues.

611
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.083
so I Trojan-horse a digital tracking bug

612
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:42.833
- into their VPN.
- Are you saying...

613
00:41:42.916 --> 00:41:43.958
Yeah. I can track the device.

614
00:41:44.041 --> 00:41:45.375
Then I suggest you do it.

615
00:41:45.458 --> 00:41:47.125
Can we circle back
on the whole paying me thing?

616
00:41:47.208 --> 00:41:49.125
I know what they paid you.
We'll double it.

617
00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:51.250
- Triple.
- Garcia.

618
00:41:51.333 --> 00:41:52.916
Hey. hey. hey. hey! Come on!

619
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.250
All right. all right. Double's fine.
It's Christmas.

620
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:57.416
Wise choice.

621
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.083
I need my cell phone.

622
00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:08.416
Whoever did this...

623
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.250
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

624
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:11.500
I work alone.

625
00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:13.458
- You used to.
- No offense.

626
00:42:13.541 --> 00:42:16.291
but I'm not rolling into Aruba undercover
with a giant elf.

627
00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:18.291
It's E.L.F.!

628
00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:20.333
- Cal.
- We can't trust this guy.

629
00:42:20.416 --> 00:42:22.333
That's why you're holding the leash.

630
00:42:22.416 --> 00:42:23.583
And this...

631
00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:27.583
...is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

632
00:42:27.666 --> 00:42:29.375
You're mine until we find him.

633
00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.166
I suggest you get going.

634
00:42:33.666 --> 00:42:36.416
Claws!

635
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:03.125
Well. this is unfortunate.

636
00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:06.583
No. this is what needed to be done.

637
00:43:06.666 --> 00:43:08.958
I sincerely doubt that.

638
00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:14.541
You know. I know a guy
who's gonna be very upset about this.

639
00:43:20.583 --> 00:43:22.083
What are you gonna do with that?

640
00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:26.041
The world is a mess
because they fear nothing.

641
00:43:27.916 --> 00:43:30.750
I'm going to give them something to fear.

642
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.916
I'm going to do in one night

643
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.875
what you have failed to do for centuries.

644
00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:40.958
And what is that?

645
00:43:41.041 --> 00:43:43.500
I'm gonna make the world a better place.

646
00:43:53.666 --> 00:43:54.750
What are you doing?

647
00:43:54.833 --> 00:43:57.125
Borrowing some of your energy.

648
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:01.458
Now...

649
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:05.333
...go to sleep. Nicholas.

650
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.791
Go to sleep.

651
00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:40.708

Like. it's a big job for one day.

We work 364 days a year

00:48:07.666 --> 00:48:11.041
You know. like send different teams out
different places. just more efficient?

703
00:48:11.125 --> 00:48:12.458
No. it doesn't work like that.

704
00:48:12.541 --> 00:48:13.875
He's got to do it all himself?

705
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:16.208
He doesn't have to. It's his purpose.

706
00:48:16.291 --> 00:48:17.791
He's a singular force in the universe.

707
00:48:17.875 --> 00:48:21.083
Okay. so worst-case scenario...
is there someone that can step in for him.

708
00:48:21.166 --> 00:48:22.666
like a vice Santa Claus?

709
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.500
Are you listening to me? No.

710
00:48:24.583 --> 00:48:26.291
No one can do what he does.

711
00:48:26.375 --> 00:48:29.125
He knows when you're sleeping.
he knows when you're awake.

712
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:32.416
and he knows that about
every single person on this planet.

713
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.291
He has a list the size of Rhode Island.
and he checks it twice.

714
00:48:36.375 --> 00:48:38.125
If you were to try to read that list
just once.

715
00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:40.583
it would take you a decade.
but he does it twice.

716
00:48:40.666 --> 00:48:42.916
And the reason why
he's able to do any of it

717
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.791
is because he is Santa Claus.
the one and only.

718
00:48:47.875 --> 00:48:50.750
and no one else can execute his mission.

719
00:48:51.833 --> 00:48:53.083

I can see a person's worst qualities

He's married but not to her.

That's why he has a tan line
where his wedding ring should be.

This guy's about to screw over that guy.

across this heavenly beach.

796
00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:55.375

- Look. I'm telling you.

00:53:55.458 --> 00:53:59.916
for your own health and well-being.
I suggest you leave right now.

879
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.958
Tell Grandma I don't have time
to pick up her meds.

880
01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:33.166
She can take the bus.

881

Goodbye.

882
01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:36.291
Asshole.

890
01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.166
It's still here.

891

What do you mean it's still there?

892
01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:18.125
It's supposed to come back to me.

893
01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:20.875
The machine isn't working. Fix it.

894
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:25.041
Now. or else the next test
will be on one of you.

895
01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:28.083
Yes. Mum.

896
01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:32.500
Careful.

897
01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.958
That's it.

898
01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.750
She iced the broker.

899
01:03:39.833 --> 01:03:41.416
She really wanted to shut him up.

900
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.166
By the time he thaws out.
he'll be useless to us.

901
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.125
Hey. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

902
01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:48.958
My guys scanned all the surveillance
footage from the Pole last night.

903
01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:50.916
Look at this.

904
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.333
- That her?
- Sort of.

905
01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:57.166
She's a shape-shifter.

906
01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:00.583
She's actually a 900-year-old ogre
with 13 sons who kill on command.

907
01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:02.208
Huh.

908
01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:05.208
Tracking shape-shifters
is a nightmare.

909
01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:08.250
She said that she was gonna
punish them all. every level.

910
01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:10.291
I'd be more worried
about what she didn't say.

911
01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:12.291
She wasn't negotiating.

912
01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:13.958
It's a kidnapping with no demands.

913
01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:15.208
Doesn't usually end well.

914
01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:18.750
Unfortunately. our only lead
is now an ice cube.

915
01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:20.500
Not pointing any fingers.

916
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:23.250
- Cal. not helpful.
- Yeah. Cal.

917
01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:24.708
Not helpful.

918
01:04:26.416 --> 01:04:28.166
So. what would you normally do?

919
01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:32.583
I mean. normally.
I'd be running credit cards.

920
01:04:32.666 --> 01:04:34.333
checking pings off cell phone towers.

921
01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:36.958
trying to build a footprint...
her. her associates.

922
01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:39.333
Never tracked a witch before.

923
01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:40.750
Dated a few.

924
01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:41.958
Right. Cal?

925
01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:44.291
I've dated several witches.
What's your point?

926
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.125
Would she have any footprint
that I wouldn't know about

927
01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:50.000
because I'm. like. a regular human being?

928
01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:52.250
Have you run a check on recent UDMs?

929
01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:56.625
- What's that?
- Unauthorized deployments of magic.

930
01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:00.833
Lot of hits. Pretty typical stuff.

931
01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:03.833
Couple of abjurations in Nairobi.

932
01:05:03.916 --> 01:05:06.333
Handful of divinations
in Santiago and New Orleans.

933
01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:07.708
No. she's a conjurer.

934
01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:12.166
Got a pair of conjurations
eight days ago. few hours apart.

935
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:15.166
Picked up the echo
off the resonator in Germany.

936
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.250
The brother.

937
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.083
- Whose brother?
- Nick's.

938
01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.333
- Santa's got a brother?
- Adopted. yes.

939
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.541
She's working with the brother.

940
01:05:23.625 --> 01:05:24.875
We don't know that.

941
01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:26.666
No. but can you think
of a better place to hold Nick?

942
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.000
Think about it.
It's under a concealment dome.

943
01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:30.916
and MORA has no jurisdiction
because of the treaty.

944
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.375
He doesn't leave. and we don't visit.
That's the deal.

945
01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:35.458
We bust in and Nick's not there...

946
01:05:35.541 --> 01:05:36.708
MORA's not going. We're going.

947
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:38.083
And he's never gonna know we're there.

948
01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:40.375
- Cal...
- T minus 17 hours. Director.

949
01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:47.875
Keep me in the loop every step.

950
01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:50.458
In two hours. I brief the presidents
and prime ministers

951
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:53.375
and kings and queens of everywhere
so they can prepare.

952
01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.166
Prepare for what?

953
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.125
For the possibility of no Christmas.

954
01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:08.333
Hey. You don't have a Wonder Woman
action figure. do you?

955
01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:10.208
That's not how it works. Come on.

956
01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.166
Ah. damn it.

957
01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.041
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

958
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:35.250
I can't believe
they're out of essential oils!

959
01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:42.791
Hey.

960
01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:45.625
Dylan asked you to go
to his concert tonight and you said no?

961
01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.000
What? No. that's not what happened.

962
01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:50.666
He actually said I shouldn't go.
He said it was gonna be lame.

963
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.416
If he didn't want you to go.

964
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.666
<i>he wouldn't have brought it up.</i>

965
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.875
<i>An actual parent
doesn't need an invitation.</i>

966
01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:58.291
They just go.
whether the kid likes it or not.

967
01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:01.250
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

968
01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:03.541
Well. we both know
that's not my strong suit. Olivia.

969
01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:06.208
Look. if he wanted me to go.
he should've just asked me.

970
01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:07.708
He's vulnerable. Jack.

971
01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:10.541
He's a kid. and he knows
you never show up.

972
01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:13.166
Olivia. I'm in... I'm at work.

973
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:14.708
What am I supposed to do?

974
01:07:14.791 --> 01:07:16.458
I don't want to have to tell you
what to do. Jack.

975
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:19.125
I want you to figure it out on your own.
because it's pretty easy.

976
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:20.708
The concert starts at 7:00.

977
01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.583
Well. I'm not gonna be home by 7:00.
Just tell Dylan that I...

978
01:07:22.666 --> 01:07:23.833
<i>I'm not telling him anything.</i>

979
01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:26.083
If you want to tell him something.
do it yourself.

980
01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:31.250
What?

981
01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:33.541
I didn't say anything.

982
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.791
Dylan. right?

983
01:07:58.458 --> 01:07:59.875
Yeah.

984
01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.500
He's a good kid.

985
01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.875
Yeah. I know he's a good kid.

986
01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:17.208
It's not what you think.
His mother and I were never together.

987
01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:19.541
I mean. I'm his father.
but I've never been his dad.

988
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.375
She's a doctor now.
and she's married to a really good guy.

989
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:28.416
and he is a good dad.
so the last thing the kid needs is. like.

990
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.291
you know. some spare dad
who's a degenerate gambler

991
01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:34.416
hanging out with the scum of the earth.
who's got nothing to offer him. so...

992
01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.833
Honestly. the best thing I can do
for the kid is keep some distance

993
01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:42.125
so I don't get in the way
and he's not disappointed all the time.

994
01:08:42.208 --> 01:08:43.583
Uh-huh.

995
01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.291
"Uh-huh." what?

996
01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:50.166
I'm just saying.
if you're trying not to disappoint him...

997
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
...doesn't sound like it's working.

998
01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:23.625
<i>Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this. but...</i>

999
01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:26.375
what's the deal with Santa
and his brother?

1000
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.333
They used to work together...

1001
01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:35.875
back in the beginning.

1002
01:09:35.958 --> 01:09:38.916
Red gave gifts to well-behaved children.

1003
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.500
and the brother helped keep track
of who they were.

1004
01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:44.583
Then the brother started making lists.

1005
01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:47.291
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1006
01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:50.833
He didn't like the idea of a running list
of misbehaved children.

1007
01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:54.291
But the brother became obsessed.

1008
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.708
So you're saying Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1009
01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.833
Yes.

1010
01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:04.375
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1011
01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:07.750
Red was furious.

1012
01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:12.625
So he took the list away.
and the brother never forgave him.

1013
01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.625
He went out on his own.
eventually hooking up with the Witch.

1014
01:10:15.708 --> 01:10:18.541
who was also in the punishment game.

1015
01:10:18.625 --> 01:10:22.041
working Iceland
and several other Nordic territories.

1016
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:26.791
They were together for years.
but it ended badly.

1017
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:31.958
Santa's brother have a name.
or is it just "Santa's brother"?

1018
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500
His name is Krampus.

1019
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:44.083
All right. listen to me. I don't know
what's waiting for us in here.

1020
01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:45.500
but the brother. the Witch.

1021
01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:48.208
they're extremely dangerous.
and not in the ways that you're used to.

1022
01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:50.041
If you see them. do not engage.

1023
01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:51.791
So don't pick a fight with the Witch.

1024
01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:52.875
Got it.

1025
01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:55.416
If Nick is here. he's probably
being held in the dungeon.

1026
01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.250
There's a door around back
that the guards use.

1027
01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.041
We're gonna have to quietly sneak
through the courtyard.

1028
01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:00.958
past the guillotines.
break in and head down.

1029
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:02.041
The guillotines?

1030
01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:05.083
Also. do not touch anything
under any circumstances.

1031
01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:07.750
There is much in here
that is not of the natural world.

1032
01:11:07.833 --> 01:11:09.708
You're human. therefore weak.

1033
01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:12.541
So. if you need to touch anything.
get me to do it.

1034
01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:17.000
Wait a minute. Are you not human?

1035
01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:18.875
Do I look human?

1036
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.583
Hey. So listen. man.

1037
01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:07.083
I think. if you don't need me here.
I might just go back to the car.

1038
01:12:07.166 --> 01:12:08.458
Shh.

1039
01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:16.583
- Hellhounds.
- Hellhounds?

1040
01:12:24.666 --> 01:12:25.666
Stand back.

1041
01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:33.833
Ellen. distract them.

1042
01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:14.416
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1043
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.875
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1044
01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:18.125
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1045
01:13:18.208 --> 01:13:20.125
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha...

1046
01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:21.250
What'd you do?

1047
01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:22.625
What do you mean what did I do?

1048
01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:24.000
I didn't do anything.

1049
01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:27.833
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah. Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1050
01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.458
Thieves!

1051
01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.000
Holy shit.

1052
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.041
Whoa. whoa.

1053
01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:36.291
Cal! Cal!

1054
01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:38.291
My name is Callum Drift.
commander of the E.L.F.

1055
01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:39.916
- We are not thieves.
- Yeah. we're not thieves!

1056
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.916
We're not thieves!

1057
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.083
Oh!

1058
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.166
This was in his pocket.

1059
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.500
All right. I can explain that.

1060
01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:50.125
I can explain that.

1061
01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.958
I told you not to touch anything.

1062
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:00.583
It was an innocent mistake.

1063
01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:04.083
You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1064
01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:06.708
Not innocent and not a mistake.

1065
01:14:06.791 --> 01:14:09.583
Well. who leaves their gold just lying out
in an open treasure chest?

1066
01:14:09.666 --> 01:14:12.041
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1067
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:14.208
Guests come. they leave him gifts.
You stole from it.

1068
01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.791
I shouldn't be surprised.

1069
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.500
Is that 'cause I happen to be on the list?

1070
01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:23.750
You disappointed in me. too. Cal?

1071
01:14:23.833 --> 01:14:27.875
I have no expectations of you. Jack.
so I can't be disappointed.

1072
01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:36.708
You know. I got problems of my own.

1073
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:39.625
I owe somebody a lot of money
that I don't have.

1074
01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:42.750
I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

1075
01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:45.458
If you look at it a certain way.
what choice did I even have?

1076
01:14:45.541 --> 01:14:48.583
You have every choice. It's all choices.

1077
01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:50.708
You don't just happen
to be on the list. Jack.

1078
01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:53.333
You put yourself there.

1079
01:14:53.416 --> 01:14:55.375
You decide to steal gold.

1080
01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:59.541
You decide to only look out for yourself
over everyone else on this Earth.

1081
01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:02.791
Every one of those kids
who are counting on us.

1082
01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:07.416
Counting on me to do my job.

1083
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:19.208
Nick always says that every decision.
big or small. is an opportunity.

1084
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.500
To be nice?

1085
01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:24.708
To be good.

1086
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:26.125
Or not.

1087
01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.083
I was one day away from retirement.

1088
01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:33.833
Then this happens.

1089
01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:37.666
After 542 years.

1090
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.291
I resigned yesterday.

1091
01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:43.791
You did?

1092
01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.000
Why?

1093
01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:50.500
I couldn't see it anymore.

1094
01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:52.833
Couldn't see what?

1095
01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:58.708
Doesn't matter.

1096
01:16:11.916 --> 01:16:14.125
The third touch.

1097
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:21.875
Is that him?

1098
01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:32.875
What are they doing?

1099
01:16:36.958 --> 01:16:39.166
They're playing Krampusschlap.

1100
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.750
Krampusschlap?

1101
01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:44.916
It's the official game of Krampusnacht.

1102
01:16:57.458 --> 01:17:02.791
Ever undefeated. Dread Lord Krampus!

1103
01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:14.500
Callum Drift.

1104
01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.000
Lord Krampus.

1105
01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:20.166
The festivities are just beginning.

1106
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.916
but I don't remember inviting you.

1107
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.166
You shouldn't be here.

1108
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.666
You know you shouldn't be here.

1109
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.375
and yet here you are.

1110
01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.166
And with a mortal.

1111
01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:41.291
Uh. I'm Jack O'Malley.

1112
01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:42.833
I didn't... I'm not...

1113
01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:45.333
We didn't even... I mean. obviously we...

1114
01:17:45.416 --> 01:17:47.041
I just met him today.

1115
01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:49.166
The big one was armed with this.

1116
01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.125
A Northern Vambrace.

1117
01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:53.583
Thank you.

1118
01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:57.125
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

1119
01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:59.333
Krampus. I can explain...

1120
01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:01.750
You're trying to find him.

1121
01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:04.333
and you thought he would be here.

1122
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.583
Well. guess what. Northerner.

1123
01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.708
He's not here.

1124
01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:17.875
Last night. he was taken
from the compound by the Witch.

1125
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:21.208
And I know that she was here not long ago.

1126
01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:25.666
Are you accusing me of something. Drift?

1127
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:28.708
You and she were partners once.

1128
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.666
Roaming the countryside. the villages.

1129
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.166
Punishing people.

1130
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.916
Yes.

1131
01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.666
But back then. she was glorious.

1132
01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:41.166
An ogre 18 feet high.

1133
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.333
The skin of an elephant.

1134
01:18:43.416 --> 01:18:46.625
Giant pair of tails.

1135
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:52.041
And yes. punishing as the cruelest winter.

1136
01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.958
We had some wonderful times together.

1137
01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.708
But I gave up that work. remember?

1138
01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:05.000
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty.

1139
01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:08.041
trying to scare them into decency.

1140
01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:10.000
I did my part!

1141
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.583
The only punishing I do now...

1142
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:18.333
...is for fun.

1143
01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:20.250
Like my good friend over here...

1144
01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:24.500
...enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

1145
01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:26.291
But today is not Krampusnacht.

1146
01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:29.333
In this house. Northerner.

1147
01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:33.625
it is always Krampusnacht!

1148
01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.583
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah!

1149
01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:38.208
Ah. ah. ah! Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!

1150
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:40.083
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1151
01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:43.500
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1152
01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:45.833
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah! Ooh. ah. ooh. ah!

1153
01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:48.166
- Krampus!
- Ah. ah. ah! Ooh...

1154
01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.500
Why was she here?

1155
01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:56.875
Many years ago. she gave me a gift.

1156
01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.166
She came because she wanted it back.

1157
01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.541
A gift? What gift?

1158
01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:03.791
The Glaskäfig.

1159
01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:07.458
On its face. a simple glass snow globe.

1160
01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:11.166
but its true purpose is nefarious.

1161
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.000
Tremendously punishing.

1162
01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:16.041
She wants to punish them all.

1163
01:20:16.125 --> 01:20:19.750
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

1164
01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:22.125
A prison for but one.

1165
01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.791
Krampus. I need to find him.

1166
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.750
Let me go.

1167
01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:36.083
And why...

1168
01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:38.166
would I do that?

1169
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.833
Because we need him.

1170
01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.541
Now more than ever. we need him.

1171
01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.041
And you know that.

1172
01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:53.166
Let me go.

1173
01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.125
Northerner.

1174
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:07.500
You are not going anywhere.

1175
01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.541
You. get out.

1176
01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:14.208
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1177
01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:17.583
There is a price for this intrusion.

1178
01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:20.875
Now and forever.

1179
01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:23.208
Drift belongs to me.

1180
01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:28.708
So I can...

1181
01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.500
just walk out of here?

1182
01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:32.833
I suggest you run.

1183
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.958
You'll learn to love it here.

1184
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.708
Take him away.

1185
01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:47.416
Wait. Uh. wait. wait. wait. wait.
Uh. sorry. Wait.

1186
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.041
Um. uh. L-Lord... uh. Mister...

1187
01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:51.958
Lord Krampus. um...

1188
01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.541
you and I aren't so different.

1189
01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:01.000
We're pretty different. but I think
we have some things in common.

1190
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.416
Ah. Do you. now?

1191
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.708
Yeah.

1192
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:07.583
I mean. you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1193
01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:08.875
Bit of a gambler?

1194
01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.375
Well. so am I.

1195
01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:14.833
Now. when we came in here. my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

1196
01:22:14.916 --> 01:22:17.833
at your game. uh. Krampusschlap.

1197
01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:19.833
What?

1198
01:22:19.916 --> 01:22:23.000
Now. initially. I said. "No way."

1199
01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.833
But the more I see him getting riled up.
I'm starting to like my odds.

1200
01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:28.541
so just hear me out.

1201
01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:31.625
If you win. we go to your dungeon forever.

1202
01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:34.708
If he wins. we walk.

1203
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.750
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

1204
01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.583
I mean. I get that. He's a big guy.

1205
01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:41.250
No shame.

1206
01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:42.625
Lot of people watching.

1207
01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:50.583
Imbeciles.

1208
01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:52.750
I love it.

1209
01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.458
- Oh.
- Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!

1210
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:56.500
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1211
01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1212
01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:20.291
The rules are as follows:

1213
01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.708
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

1214
01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:27.500
The first to be knocked out or die loses.

1215
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.541
First touch.

1216
01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:36.250
That's you.

1217
01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.500
You know. I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

1218
01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:52.541
Come on.

1219
01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:54.416
I'm sure you do.

1220
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.916
He's still your brother.

1221
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.625
And he never gave up on you.

1222
01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.041
What would you know about it?

1223
01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:03.958
I know him.

1224
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:09.625
Take your best "schlap."

1225
01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:27.000
Interesting.

1226
01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.500
My turn.

1227
01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.583
I could be merciful

1228
01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:41.291
and kill him on the first touch.

1229
01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:44.500
But what fun would that be. huh?

1230
01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.250
Oh. my God.

1231
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.750
Hey. buddy. You okay?

1232
01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.750
He just slapped the shit out of me.

1233
01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.125
Yeah. that was so embarrassing.

1234
01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:20.166
I love this game!

1235
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.291
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I...

1236
01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:23.875
Just get up. Trust me.

1237
01:25:23.958 --> 01:25:25.875
I can't...

1238
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.250
Second touch.

1239
01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:38.125
Oh. Sorry.

1240
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.541
Let me make it easier for you.

1241
01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.833
Come on.

1242
01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.708
Come on.

1243
01:25:58.583 --> 01:25:59.875
Come on.

1244
01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.500
Cover us.

1245
01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:07.458
Ellen. come on!

1246
01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:28.500
I thought I had some shady friends.

1247
01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:32.458
I can't believe that worked.

1248
01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:34.833
Yeah. sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

1249
01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.416
No. it was great.

1250
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.125
Oh.

1251
01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:40.833
I misjudged you.

1252
01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.750
Not what you'd expect
from a Class Four Naughty Lister. right?

1253
01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.041
Well. it's Level Four.

1254
01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:48.750
- Ah.
- But that's what I'm saying.

1255
01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:51.208
You could've left. but you didn't.

1256
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.166
Thank you.

1257
01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:57.791
All right.

1258
01:27:57.875 --> 01:27:59.666
Should we go find your guy?

1259
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:02.833
Let's save Christmas.

1260
01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:06.208
Right.

1261
01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:07.250
Say it.

1262
01:28:07.333 --> 01:28:09.208
- I can't.
- Yes. you can. Say it.

1263
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:10.625
- I don't want to.
- Let's save Christmas.

1264
01:28:10.708 --> 01:28:11.875
I'm not gonna say that.

1265
01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:15.708
I'm gonna need you to say.
"Let's save Christmas."

1266
01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:18.125
All right. God. Okay.

1267
01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:19.916
Let's save Christmas.

1268
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.875
That was terrible.

1269
01:28:21.958 --> 01:28:23.125
Okay.

1270
01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:25.458
All right. all right.

1271
01:28:27.666 --> 01:28:29.458
Let's save Christmas.

1272
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:31.333
- There it is.
- All right.

1273
01:28:31.416 --> 01:28:34.041
All right. so the. uh. snow globe.
what's the deal with that?

1274
01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:35.291
The "glossy pig"?

1275
01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:37.958
Glaskäfig. It's German for "glass cage."

1276
01:28:38.041 --> 01:28:39.250
Well. what do you think
Gryla's trying to do?

1277
01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:41.208
- Is there...
- Shh.

1278
01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:43.208
<i>...Gryla's trying...?</i>

1279
01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:47.041
We got to go.

1280
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:50.666
Mum.

1281
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:53.708
Ready for another test.

1282
01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.000
Good.

1283
01:28:55.083 --> 01:28:57.458
The next name on the list?

1284
01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:59.916
No.

1285
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.333
I have a better idea.

1286
01:29:04.541 --> 01:29:06.541
She said she wanted to punish them all.

1287
01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:08.583
It seems like the Glaskäfig
was just for one person.

1288
01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:13.083
Is it possible she can make more of 'em
with. like. witch magic or...

1289
01:29:13.166 --> 01:29:14.916
She would need billions of them.

1290
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.458
She's immensely powerful.
but that's a big lift for a conjurer.

1291
01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.625
Okay.

1292
01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:22.500
I mean. honestly. the only place that has
that kind of manufacturing capacity...

1293
01:29:22.583 --> 01:29:23.875
Look out!

1294
01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:44.708
♪ ♪

1295
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:50.750
This something that happens to you a lot?

1296
01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:55.375
Unexplained player piano
in the middle of a German highway.

1297
01:29:55.458 --> 01:29:57.833
No. This is rare.

1298
01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:05.958
It's for you.

1299
01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:08.500
Well. I'm not touching that thing.

1300
01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:11.083
Just get back in the truck. We'll drive
right around the haunted piano.

1301
01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:13.666
We have to open it.

1302
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:16.375
This... this is how it starts.

1303
01:30:16.458 --> 01:30:18.416
You're doing it.

1304
01:30:27.708 --> 01:30:31.166
Oh. see?

1305
01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.000
Dylan.

1306
01:30:37.083 --> 01:30:40.250
<i>Did you send me this stupid present
instead of coming to this thing?</i>

1307
01:30:40.333 --> 01:30:41.958
Wait. what?

1308
01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:44.000
Because if you don't want to come.
I don't care.

1309
01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:46.083
I wanted to be there. I really did.

1310
01:30:46.166 --> 01:30:48.208
- Then something...
- <i>Just stop. okay?</i>

1311
01:30:48.291 --> 01:30:51.458
<i>You don't have to pretend
because my mom is guilt-tripping you.</i>

1312
01:30:51.541 --> 01:30:52.875
I'm not pretending.

1313
01:30:52.958 --> 01:30:55.166
- <i>I really want to find a way...</i>
- You never come to anything.

1314
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:56.958
Yeah. I... I know.

1315
01:30:57.041 --> 01:30:58.291
- I know.
- <i>Whatever.</i>

1316
01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:01.666
<i>I got to go. Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts. okay?</i>

1317
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:04.166
W-Wait. wait.
Dylan. what'd you mean by that?

1318
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:05.333
<i>This thing.</i>

1319
01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:09.291
- Dylan. don't touch that. Wait.
- No. don't.

1320
01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.166
Do you seriously think
that there's anything...

1321
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:12.833
Dylan. listen to me. Put that down.

1322
01:31:12.916 --> 01:31:14.750
<i>Because I'm here to tell you that...</i>

1323
01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.166
What is this?

1324
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:17.458
What's going on?

1325
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:22.958
What's happening?

1326
01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:25.125
Put that down!

1327
01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:28.583
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

1328
01:31:28.666 --> 01:31:29.875
I don't know.

1329
01:31:34.333 --> 01:31:36.166
Jack.

1330
01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:39.708
It's my kid.

1331
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.708
Find me.

1332
01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:57.000
Dad?

1333
01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:59.083
- Dad! What's going on?
- Dylan.

1334
01:31:59.166 --> 01:32:00.375
Where are we?

1335
01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:04.625
Oh. my God.

1336
01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:07.750
Oh. my God.

1337
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.041
It worked.

1338
01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:19.208
Mm. Jack O'Malley.

1339
01:32:19.291 --> 01:32:21.291
Level Four.

1340
01:32:21.375 --> 01:32:24.583
What a perfect way to start my collection.

1341
01:32:24.666 --> 01:32:27.416
Bring production online.

1342
01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:52.416
Tonight. I will deliver one of these
to every single deviant on the list.

1343
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.500
And when they wake up and open their gift.

1344
01:32:55.583 --> 01:32:57.583
they'll join my collection.

1345
01:32:57.666 --> 01:33:01.583
and the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

1346
01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:02.833
Finally.

1347
01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:07.083
Tonight. I make the ride.

1348
01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:11.458
Director. we have Drift.

1349
01:33:11.541 --> 01:33:12.791
What happened?

1350
01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:14.416
What do you know about the Glaskäfig?

1351
01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.791
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison the naughty.

1352
01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:18.291
Krampus has it. Why?

1353
01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:20.291
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

1354
01:33:20.375 --> 01:33:21.875
<i>And I think she's trying
to punish everyone on the list.</i>

1355
01:33:21.958 --> 01:33:22.958
Wait. Slow down.

1356
01:33:23.041 --> 01:33:24.375
O'Malley just got globed

1357
01:33:24.458 --> 01:33:26.250
- <i>and disappeared.</i>
- What?

1358
01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:27.458
His kid. too.

1359
01:33:27.541 --> 01:33:29.250
Oh. dear Lord.

1360
01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:31.416
- <i>Run O'Malley's tag.</i>
- <i>Yes. Director.</i>

1361
01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:36.208
Zoe. I think she's trying
to mass-produce the Glaskäfig.

1362
01:33:36.291 --> 01:33:38.000
- <i>How could she possibly do that?</i>
- Think about it.

1363
01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:40.708
<i>What's the one place that's capable
of something like that?</i>

1364
01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:42.083
The North Pole?

1365
01:33:42.166 --> 01:33:44.208
But Nick's not there.
The complex runs on his power.

1366
01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:46.250
That can't be it.

1367
01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:48.583
- Unless...
- <i>Unless he never left.</i>

1368
01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:52.625
- But the snowcat. the jet.
- <i>Drones. diversions.</i>

1369
01:33:54.458 --> 01:33:55.875
Nick is still there.

1370
01:33:55.958 --> 01:33:59.583
Director. I am not picking up
a signal for O'Malley's tracker.

1371
01:34:01.625 --> 01:34:03.625
Because he's under the dome.

1372
01:34:03.708 --> 01:34:05.875
<i>But I've been talking
to your team all night.</i>

1373
01:34:05.958 --> 01:34:07.791
You have?

1374
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.916
<i>Try Partridge.</i>

1375
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.166
- Connect to Partridge.
- Yes. Director.

1376
01:34:17.208 --> 01:34:20.000
- <i>Hi. Cal.</i>
- <i>Hey. How you holding up. MC?</i>

1377
01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:21.458
Well. I can't sleep.

1378
01:34:21.541 --> 01:34:25.041
I'm just keeping myself busy
baking cookies for him.

1379
01:34:25.125 --> 01:34:26.458
For when he comes home.

1380
01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:28.000
Well. he's gonna love that.

1381
01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:29.291
What do you got baking?

1382
01:34:29.375 --> 01:34:33.291
Just pulled out
a fresh batch of macaroons.

1383
01:34:35.916 --> 01:34:37.333
He'll love that.

1384
01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:40.583
Hang in. I'll keep you posted.

1385
01:34:40.666 --> 01:34:42.500
<i>Thanks.</i>

1386
01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:45.375
That's not her.

1387
01:34:45.458 --> 01:34:46.666
What do you mean?

1388
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:48.208
<i>Nick hates macaroons.</i>

1389
01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:51.458
They're shape-shifters.

1390
01:34:51.541 --> 01:34:52.958
<i>The Witch. the Lads.</i>

1391
01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:54.666
They're all shape-shifters.

1392
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.500
The North Pole has been taken.

1393
01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:07.083
They're onto us.

1394
01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:08.708
Where are we?

1395
01:35:08.791 --> 01:35:11.666
- What's happening?
- Okay. okay. okay. okay. Now. listen.

1396
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:15.208
Now. I know
what this is gonna sound like.

1397
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:17.708
Basically...

1398
01:35:19.916 --> 01:35:25.375
...Santa is missing.
and that giant lady is a witch.

1399
01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:30.250
and she got the snow globes
from a giant demonic Christmas...

1400
01:35:30.333 --> 01:35:31.750
goat man.

1401
01:35:31.833 --> 01:35:33.708
And now they're gonna make
millions of them

1402
01:35:33.791 --> 01:35:37.166
with that magical photocopier thing.

1403
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:39.291
Look. I don't have
all the technical details.

1404
01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:44.666
but basically. these globes are meant
to imprison the naughty people forever.

1405
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:46.875
Forever?

1406
01:35:47.958 --> 01:35:49.958
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1407
01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:58.875
Remember. can't trust anyone.

1408
01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:02.083
I've got a signal.

1409
01:36:02.166 --> 01:36:04.041
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1410
01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.875
- We're close.
- Hey. chief.

1411
01:36:11.375 --> 01:36:12.958
Fred?

1412
01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:17.166
- I'll let the team know that you're back.
- How about you don't?

1413
01:36:22.083 --> 01:36:23.500
Shape-shifters.

1414
01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:26.166
Good tidings.

1415
01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:34.041
It says he should be right here.

1416
01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:39.416
The old tunnel system.

1417
01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.041
Runs right beneath the original workshop.

1418
01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:44.125
Let's go.

1419
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.583
Is this happening because I was ditching?

1420
01:36:47.666 --> 01:36:48.708
What?

1421
01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:50.041
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1422
01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:52.208
No. no. no. no. no. no. Dylan.

1423
01:36:52.291 --> 01:36:53.625
You said it was for naughty people.
didn't you?

1424
01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:55.083
Well. she said that. but...

1425
01:36:55.166 --> 01:36:56.791
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1426
01:36:56.875 --> 01:36:58.291
Look at me.

1427
01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:02.583
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1428
01:37:02.666 --> 01:37:05.708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1429
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.000
You're only in here be...

1430
01:37:10.083 --> 01:37:11.916
because of me.

1431
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:14.708
What did you do?

1432
01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:17.208
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1433
01:37:17.291 --> 01:37:19.625
It's... long list.

1434
01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:23.958
But bigger than any of that.
it's what I didn't do.

1435
01:37:24.041 --> 01:37:25.875
What are you talking about?

1436
01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.208
I've been a terrible father.

1437
01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:38.875
- That's not true.
- Yes. it is. It is.

1438
01:37:38.958 --> 01:37:40.583
I haven't been around.

1439
01:37:40.666 --> 01:37:43.625
I told myself I was doing you a favor.
which is bullshit.

1440
01:37:43.708 --> 01:37:47.166
It was bad for you.
and it was terrible for me.

1441
01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:51.333
I've made some mistakes. pal. I know that.

1442
01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:53.750
But I also know that I can do better.

1443
01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.958
And I know that's easier said than done.

1444
01:37:57.041 --> 01:38:00.625
I know it's a lot of work.
and I hope it's not too late.

1445
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.791
Every day.
every decision is an opportunity.

1446
01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:13.500
And I want to start taking some of those.

1447
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.958
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

1448
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:20.625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

1449
01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:24.541
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world.

1450
01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:27.291
but I know I can do better.

1451
01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:30.833
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1452
01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:33.125
I will never stop trying.

1453
01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.208
What just happened?

1454
01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1455
01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:10.541
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1456
01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:13.333
First. we got to find somebody. Come on.

1457
01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:23.333
Ow.

1458
01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:25.291
Cal.

1459
01:39:26.833 --> 01:39:30.000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now. what would it be?

1460
01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.750
Wonder Woman.

1461
01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.000
It's him.

1462
01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:35.250
You all right?

1463
01:39:35.333 --> 01:39:37.375
Yeah. Yeah.

1464
01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:38.916
It's good to see you.

1465
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.916
Dad?

1466
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.291
Buddy. come here.

1467
01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:44.791
I want you to meet some friends.

1468
01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:47.958
Cal. Zoe. this is my son Dylan.

1469
01:39:48.041 --> 01:39:49.833
The one and only Dylan.

1470
01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:51.250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

1471
01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:54.916
Welcome to the North Pole.

1472
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.250
Huh?

1473
01:39:57.333 --> 01:40:00.000
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

1474
01:40:00.083 --> 01:40:01.833
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

1475
01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:04.250
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds.

1476
01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:06.250
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1477
01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.416
Cal. we saw her.

1478
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

1479
01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:11.375
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1480
01:40:11.458 --> 01:40:12.541
to everybody on the list.

1481
01:40:12.625 --> 01:40:15.291
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1482
01:40:15.375 --> 01:40:16.541
Without him.

1483
01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:18.125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

1484
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.750
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

1485
01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:24.500
Wait.

1486
01:40:32.416 --> 01:40:33.500
Chief.

1487
01:40:33.583 --> 01:40:34.833
Garcia.

1488
01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:36.125
Cal.

1489
01:40:39.208 --> 01:40:40.750
Ma'am.

1490
01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:43.500
Where is he?

1491
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.333
Gryla. stop!

1492
01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:26.291
I was just leaving.

1493
01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:29.791
- Go. Take him.
- Come with me. Dylan. Got him.

1494
01:41:46.708 --> 01:41:48.541
Come on!

1495
01:41:48.625 --> 01:41:49.625
Go!

1496
01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:16.333
Hyah!

1497
01:44:19.166 --> 01:44:20.666
Nick.

1498
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:22.750
Come on. Red. I got you.

1499
01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.541
Red?

1500
01:44:34.625 --> 01:44:37.208
Come back to me. Come back to me. boss.

1501
01:44:37.291 --> 01:44:38.833
Wake up.

1502
01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:43.791
Nick? Nick!

1503
01:44:43.875 --> 01:44:45.708
It's Cal.

1504
01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:58.916
Cal!

1505
01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:12.500
Holy shit.

1506
01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:15.625
Jack.

1507
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.625
Run.

1508
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:23.708
No way. man.

1509
01:45:23.791 --> 01:45:26.083
For a guy like me.
there's worse ways to go out

1510
01:45:26.166 --> 01:45:28.000
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

1511
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:32.458
Gryla!

1512
01:45:33.541 --> 01:45:34.750
It's time for you to go.

1513
01:45:36.208 --> 01:45:38.833
Oh. I'll go.

1514
01:45:38.916 --> 01:45:42.125
but I'm taking him with me.

1515
01:45:42.208 --> 01:45:44.958
You're not taking him anywhere.

1516
01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:48.625
His power has been wasted
for far too long.

1517
01:45:48.708 --> 01:45:51.833
The punishing begins tonight.

1518
01:45:52.916 --> 01:45:55.500
You're gonna have to go through me first.

1519
01:45:55.583 --> 01:45:57.333
With pleasure.

1520
01:45:57.416 --> 01:45:59.666
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1521
01:45:59.750 --> 01:46:01.750
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1522
01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:03.416
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1523
01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.458
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1524
01:46:05.541 --> 01:46:08.791
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah. Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1525
01:46:17.958 --> 01:46:23.000
You imbeciles have no idea
how to talk to a woman like this.

1526
01:46:23.083 --> 01:46:25.041
A real woman.

1527
01:46:27.166 --> 01:46:28.750
She's my ex.

1528
01:46:30.666 --> 01:46:32.833
Hello.

1529
01:46:32.916 --> 01:46:34.000
My love.

1530
01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:35.666
Get out of here. Krampus.

1531
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:38.833
I can't do that.

1532
01:46:38.916 --> 01:46:43.666
And lovely as it is
to see your miserable face.

1533
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:48.416
my brother has somewhere to be.

1534
01:46:57.458 --> 01:46:59.416
Just like old times.

1535
01:47:31.166 --> 01:47:33.791
Haven't you had enough?

1536
01:47:35.375 --> 01:47:38.000
If you want to take him.

1537
01:47:38.083 --> 01:47:40.333
you're gonna have to kill me.

1538
01:47:41.416 --> 01:47:43.416
Gladly.

1539
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.541
Your sacrifice will mean nothing.

1540
01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:47.375
Gryla!

1541
01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:52.208
Enough!

1542
01:47:53.458 --> 01:47:57.041
Any last words
for your most faithful warrior?

1543
01:47:57.125 --> 01:47:59.208
Only one.

1544
01:48:00.666 --> 01:48:03.125
<i>Kavalame!</i>

1545
01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:11.333
Merry Christmas. Witch.

1546
01:48:25.625 --> 01:48:27.250
No!

1547
01:48:36.458 --> 01:48:37.958
No.

1548
01:48:41.708 --> 01:48:43.416
- No!
- Well. look at you.

1549
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.500
Oh. shut up!

1550
01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:49.916
Nick.

1551
01:48:51.333 --> 01:48:52.416
You okay?

1552
01:48:54.375 --> 01:48:55.708
Yeah.

1553
01:48:59.625 --> 01:49:01.250
What took you so long?

1554
01:49:19.583 --> 01:49:22.791
Well. look what the cat dragged in.

1555
01:49:22.875 --> 01:49:25.958
Let's not get mushy.

1556
01:49:27.041 --> 01:49:28.291
Thank you. brother.

1557
01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:34.375
Merry Christmas...

1558
01:49:34.458 --> 01:49:36.250
brother.

1559
01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:39.708
You want to maybe stick around a while?

1560
01:49:42.958 --> 01:49:44.708
Don't push it.

1561
01:49:47.291 --> 01:49:48.500
Get to work.

1562
01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:52.125
And you...

1563
01:49:52.208 --> 01:49:53.958
I want a rematch.

1564
01:50:00.666 --> 01:50:03.000
Happy Krampusnacht!

1565
01:50:09.666 --> 01:50:11.333
Oh. my God.

1566
01:50:11.416 --> 01:50:12.708
Honey. where are you?

1567
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:14.833
<i>Mom.
you're not gonna believe this.</i>

1568
01:50:16.916 --> 01:50:18.541
<i>T plus six minutes.</i>

1569
01:50:18.625 --> 01:50:19.958
Sky Train. this is Partridge.

1570
01:50:20.041 --> 01:50:21.541
Back in the chair and back on track.

1571
01:50:21.625 --> 01:50:23.291
<i>Good to have you back. ma'am.</i>

1572
01:50:29.708 --> 01:50:31.708
We are currently
six minutes behind schedule.

1573
01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:34.250
so we're gonna run this preflight
like our hair's on fire.

1574
01:50:50.166 --> 01:50:51.708
