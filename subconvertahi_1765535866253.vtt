I want a Gatorade.

16
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.809
The red one.

17
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.145

25
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.668
I didn't say tepid.

26
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.755
I didn't say lukewarm.

27
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.466
I didn't even just say cold.

28
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:19.134
I said ice-cold.

29
00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.264
Do better next time.

30
00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:31.271

31
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:44.451
It's the end of the world

It's the end of the world
As we know it

33
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:54.837
It's the end of the world
As we know it

I'm all right

36
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:37.624
Don't nobody worry 'bout me

37
00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:43.547
You got to give me a fight…

38
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.304
Why don't you just let me be?

39
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:54.516
I'm all right. I'm all right

40
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.768
Don't nobody worry 'bout me

41
00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.522
You got to give me a fight

42
00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:03.358
Why don't you just let me be?

43
00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:05.194
I'm all right

44
00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:34.533
Head out on the highway

45
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:36.827
Looking for adventure

46
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.122
In whatever comes our way

47
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.500
And I know I gotta make it happen

48
00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:46.879
Take the world in a love embrace

49
00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:51.216
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode…

50
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.849
It's gettin' hot in here So hot

51
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.059
So take off all your clothes

52
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:06.231
I am getting so hot
I wanna take my clothes off

53
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:09.276
It's gettin' hot in here

54
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.528
So take off all your clothes

55
00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:16.825
I am getting so hot
I wanna take my clothes off

56
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.461
Georgia

57
00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.927
Georgia

58
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:39.932
The whole night through

59
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:48.023
With that old sweet song

60
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:53.278
Georgia's on my mind

61
00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:02.955
I said Georgia

62
00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.291
Georgia

63
00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.402
Hello. Carol.

64
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.612
This is a recording.

65
00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:21.116
At the tone. you can leave a message

66
00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:23.243

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.580
Our feelings for you
haven't changed. Carol.

68
00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.918
but after everything that's happened.
we just need a little space.

69
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:35.464
I want to dine out tonight.

70
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:37.674
Someplace special.

71
00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.221
I know you remember where Helen
and I had our anniversary. so there.

72
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.807
And. for the food…

73
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.422
Martha's Vineyard. 1999.

74
00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:26.431
Helen's birthday. 2008.

75
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.063
Oh. Maritozzi.

76
00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:37.317
And…

77
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.279
yes!

78
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:58.714
I'll give 'em this.

79
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.675
Those crazy bastards sure can cook.

80
00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.551
The cat.

81
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.224
The cat is gray.

82
00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:16.602
The cat…

83
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:28.279
Manousos.

84
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.866
We can give you a lift.

85
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.620
How about some water?

86
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.623
We're sure you don't want
to get dehydrated.

87
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:43.212
Losing just five percent
of your body's water content

88
00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.215
could lead to fatigue and headaches.

89
00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:48.926
Even kidney stones!

90
00:16:53.597 --> 00:16:56.517
Well. we'll leave you to it.

91
00:16:57.893 --> 00:17:02.731
There's a scenic viewpoint up ahead
that is particularly breathtaking.

92
00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.567
It might be a good spot to rest.

93
00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:08.319
You take care.

94
00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:12.074
And if you need anything at all.
just wave to the sky.

95
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:13.784
Bye bye!

96
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.062
Yellow.

97
00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:44.189
The dog.

98
00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.024
The…

99
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:48.735
The dog…

100
00:17:50.988 --> 00:17:52.823
is yellow.

101
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:05.252
Yellow.

102
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:10.591
The dog is…

103
00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:13.427
yellow.

104
00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:53.467
Yellow dog.

105
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.429
Dog yellow?

106
00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.516
What was it?

107
00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:11.443
The yellow dog.

108
00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.947
…chases the gray cat.

109
00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.159
Yellow…

110
00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:24.706
The yellow dog chases the gray cat.

111
00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:37.678
Monday.

112
00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:40.305
Monday is today.

113
00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:42.850
Tuesday is tomorrow.

114
00:19:43.934 --> 00:19:46.061
Monday is today.

115
00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:48.272
Tuesday is tomorrow.

116
00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:50.232
Tuesday.

117
00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.901
Monday is today.

118
00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:55.988
Hola. Manousos.

119
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:58.323
- Hola. Manousos.
- Hola. Manousos.

120
00:19:58.407 --> 00:19:59.408
Hola.

121
00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:01.827
- Hola. Manousos.
- Hola. Manousos.

122
00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:05.163
- Hola. Manousos.
- Hola. Manousos.

123
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:32.251
The world is big.

124
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.003
Big the world?

125
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:39.341
The world is big?

126
00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.511
The world is big.

127
00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:46.807
Today. I am not going to the library.

128
00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.477
Tomorrow. yes.

129
00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:53.689
To the library. I will go.

130
00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:58.944
Today. I'm not going to the library.

131
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.318
To whom do the coats belong?

132
00:22:40.152 --> 00:22:43.155
The coats belong to them.

133
00:22:43.864 --> 00:22:46.450
To whom do the coats belong?

134
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:48.994
To whom… To whom…

135
00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:52.581
To whom do the coats belong?

136
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.211
The coats belong to them.

137
00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:10.390
The girl saves the mouse
from the trap.

138
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:15.437
The girl saves the mouse
from the trap.

139
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:21.902
The girl saves the mouse from the trap.

140
00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:29.284
The girl saves the mouse from the trap.

141
00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:35.457
The girl saves the mouse from the trap.

142
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.070
Manousos.

143
00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:32.282
Please don't do this.

144
00:25:32.658 --> 00:25:35.327
The Darién is too dangerous.

145
00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:39.122
It's over 100 kilometers to Panama.

146
00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:42.292
And there are no marked trails.

147
00:25:42.876 --> 00:25:46.505
The forecast for this week

148
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:49.174
is not conducive to hiking.

149
00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:55.848
It's going to be over 38 degrees
with 98 percent humidity.

150
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.351
And we don't mean to harp on hydration

151
00:25:59.434 --> 00:26:04.189
but clean water is not going
to be easy to come by.

152
00:26:05.858 --> 00:26:11.655
The tropical forest hosts a remarkable
diversity of snakes. spiders and insects

153
00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:14.324
and many are quite venomous.

154
00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:16.910
And then there are the chunga palms.

155
00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:21.915
The spines can grow up
to twenty centimeters long

156
00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:24.251
and they're covered in bacteria.

157
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:29.798
Even the smallest cut could lead
to a fatal infection.

158
00:26:30.132 --> 00:26:31.758
Look around you.

159
00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:34.094
All these items were left by people

160
00:26:34.511 --> 00:26:36.847
who could carry them no farther.

161
00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:40.058
Please. Manousos.

162
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:42.978
We can take you anywhere you want to go.

163
00:26:43.312 --> 00:26:45.022
How about New Mexico?

164
00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:50.694
Isn't that where you're going.
to visit Carol Sturka?

165
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.364
We could get you there by nightfall.

166
00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:57.659
We can even transport your car.

167
00:27:01.038 --> 00:27:03.999
We know how much it means to you.

168
00:27:34.613 --> 00:27:35.697
Nothing…

169
00:27:36.782 --> 00:27:38.951
on this planet

170
00:27:39.034 --> 00:27:40.619
is yours.

171
00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:42.996
Nothing.

172
00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:48.001
You cannot give me anything.
because all that you have is stolen.

173
00:27:49.044 --> 00:27:50.838
You…

174
00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:56.343
don't belong here.

175
00:28:36.717 --> 00:28:39.595
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

176
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.974
I am not one of them.

177
00:28:45.475 --> 00:28:47.186
I wish to save the world.

178
00:28:49.271 --> 00:28:51.648
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

179
00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:55.152
I am not one of them.

180
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:58.947
I wish to save the world.

181
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.203
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

182
00:29:06.205 --> 00:29:08.749
I am not one of them.

183
00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:11.919
I wish to save the world.

184
00:29:12.628 --> 00:29:15.380
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

185
00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:19.218
