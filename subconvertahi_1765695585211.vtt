00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:22.830
The red one.

16
00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:25.166
Um. fruit punch. I think it's called.

24
00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:11.689
I didn't say tepid.

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:14.776
I didn't say lukewarm.

26
00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.487
I didn't even just say cold.

27
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.155
I said ice-cold.

28
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.285

68
00:12:32.524 --> 00:12:35.485
I want to dine out tonight.

69
00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:37.695
Someplace special.

70
00:12:38.738 --> 00:12:42.242
I know you remember where Helen
and I had our anniversary. so there.

71
00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:45.828
And. um. for the food...

72
00:13:14.983 --> 00:13:17.443
Martha's Vineyard. 1999.

73
00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:26.452
Helen's birthday. 2008.

74
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.084
Oh. <i>Maritozzi.</i>

75
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.338
And...

76
00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:40.300
yes!

77
00:13:52.478 --> 00:13:53.479
Mmm.

78
00:13:57.692 --> 00:13:58.735
I'll give 'em this.

79
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.696
Those crazy bastards sure can cook.

80
00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:07.572
The cat.

81
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:14.245
The cat is gray.

82
00:16:15.455 --> 00:16:16.623
The cat...

83
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.300
Manousos.

84
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.887
We can give you a lift.

85
00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:34.641
How about some water?

86
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.644
We're sure you don't want
to get dehydrated.

87
00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:43.233
Losing just five percent
of your body's water content

88
00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:46.236
could lead to fatigue and headaches.

89
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.947
Even kidney stones!

90
00:16:53.618 --> 00:16:56.538
Well. we'll leave you to it.

91
00:16:57.914 --> 00:17:02.752
There's a scenic viewpoint up ahead
that is particularly breathtaking.

92
00:17:03.586 --> 00:17:05.588
It might be a good spot to rest.

93
00:17:07.465 --> 00:17:08.340
You take care.

94
00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:12.095
And if you need anything at all.
just wave to the sky.

95
00:17:12.678 --> 00:17:13.805
Bye bye!

96
00:17:40.582 --> 00:17:42.083
Yellow.

97
00:17:43.209 --> 00:17:44.210
The dog.

98
00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:45.837
The...

99
00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:48.756
The dog...

100
00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:52.844
is yellow.

101
00:18:04.272 --> 00:18:05.273
Yellow.

102
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:10.612
The dog is...

103
00:18:12.447 --> 00:18:13.448
yellow.

104
00:18:51.653 --> 00:18:53.488
Yellow dog.

105
00:18:56.241 --> 00:18:57.450
Dog yellow?

106
00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:00.537
What was it?

107
00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:11.464
The yellow dog.

108
00:19:13.007 --> 00:19:14.968
<i>...chases the gray cat.</i>

109
00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:19.180
Yellow...

110
00:19:19.264 --> 00:19:24.727
The yellow dog chases the gray cat.

111
00:19:36.614 --> 00:19:37.699
Monday.

112
00:19:38.408 --> 00:19:40.326
Monday is today.

113

Tuesday is tomorrow.

114
00:19:43.955 --> 00:19:46.082
Monday is today.

115
00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.293

00:19:49.252 --> 00:19:50.253
Tuesday.

117
00:19:51.045 --> 00:19:52.922

The world is big?

126
00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:42.532
The world is big.

127
00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:46.828

128
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.498
Tomorrow. yes.

129
00:21:51.749 --> 00:21:53.710
To the library. I will go.

130
00:21:56.129 --> 00:21:58.965
Today. I'm not going to the library.

131
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:39.339
To whom do the coats belong?

132
00:22:40.173 --> 00:22:43.176
The coats belong to them.

133
00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:46.471
To whom do the coats belong?

134
00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:49.015
To whom... To whom...

135
00:22:49.098 --> 00:22:52.602
To whom do the coats belong?

136
00:22:53.811 --> 00:22:57.232
The coats belong to them.

137
00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:10.411
<i>The girl saves the mouse
from the trap.</i>

138
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.458
The girl saves the mouse
from the trap.

139
00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:21.923
The girl saves the mouse from the trap.

140
00:23:24.175 --> 00:23:29.305
The girl saves the mouse from the trap.

141
00:23:31.057 --> 00:23:35.478
The girl saves the mouse from the trap.

142
00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:28.091
Manousos.

143
00:25:30.176 --> 00:25:32.303
Please don't do this.

144
00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:35.348
The Darién is too dangerous.

145
00:25:36.057 --> 00:25:39.143
It's over 100 kilometers to Panama.

146
00:25:39.435 --> 00:25:42.313
And there are no marked trails.

147
00:25:42.897 --> 00:25:46.526
The forecast for this week

148
00:25:46.609 --> 00:25:49.195
is not conducive to hiking.

149
00:25:49.904 --> 00:25:55.869
It's going to be over 38 degrees
with 98 percent humidity.

150
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:59.372
And we don't mean to harp on hydration

151
00:25:59.455 --> 00:26:04.210
but clean water is not going
to be easy to come by.

152
00:26:05.879 --> 00:26:11.676
The tropical forest hosts a remarkable
diversity of snakes. spiders and insects

153
00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:14.345
and many are quite venomous.

154
00:26:15.054 --> 00:26:16.931
And then there are the chunga palms.

155
00:26:17.265 --> 00:26:21.936
The spines can grow up
to twenty centimeters long

156
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.272
and they're covered in bacteria.

157
00:26:24.772 --> 00:26:29.819
Even the smallest cut could lead
to a fatal infection.

158
00:26:30.153 --> 00:26:31.779
Look around you.

159
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.115
All these items were left by people

160
00:26:34.532 --> 00:26:36.868
who could carry them no farther.

161
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.079
Please. Manousos.

162
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.999
We can take you anywhere you want to go.

163
00:26:43.333 --> 00:26:45.043
How about New Mexico?

164
00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:50.715
Isn't that where you're going.
to visit Carol Sturka?

165
00:26:52.091 --> 00:26:54.385
We could get you there by nightfall.

166
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.680
We can even transport your car.

167
00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:04.020
We know how much it means to you.

168
00:27:34.634 --> 00:27:35.718
Nothing...

169
00:27:36.803 --> 00:27:38.972
on this planet

170
00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:40.640
is yours.

171
00:27:41.599 --> 00:27:43.017
Nothing.

172
00:27:43.476 --> 00:27:48.022
You cannot give me anything.
because all that you have is stolen.

173
00:27:49.065 --> 00:27:50.859
You...

174
00:27:54.487 --> 00:27:56.364
...don't belong here.

175
00:28:36.738 --> 00:28:39.616
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

176
00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:43.995
I am not one of them.

177
00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:47.207
I wish to save the world.

178
00:28:49.292 --> 00:28:51.669
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

179
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.173
I am not one of them.

180
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.968
I wish to save the world.

181
00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:04.224
