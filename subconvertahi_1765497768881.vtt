<i>If you've been in...</i>

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.795
<i>Five million dollars
or cancer?</i>

5
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.265
<i>Uh...</i>

6
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.102

<i>Where are you going?</i>

8
00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:53.871
<i>I. Slater King.</i>

9
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:56.307
<i>would like
to formally apologize</i>

10
00:01:56.442 --> 00:01:58.876
<i>for my behavior.</i>

11
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.084
<i>I have sought therapy.</i>

12
00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.813

14
00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:17.663
<i>Slater King.</i>

15
00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.936
<i>thank you
for joining us tonight.</i>

16
00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:21.966
<i>Let's
get to the question</i>

17
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:24.309
<i>that everybody is dying
for you to answer.</i>

18
00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:26.510
<i>Where have you been
since you stepped down</i>

19
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.545
<i>and made your CFO Vic Mahoney
CEO of King-Tech?</i>

20
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.882
<i>After everything
that happened.</i>

21
00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.813
<i>um... I just realized</i>

22
00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:35.954
<i>that sometimes
you really do have to just</i>

23
00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.552
<i>stop and smell the flowers.</i>

24
00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:41.626
<i>So. uh. I sort of
bought an island.</i>

25
00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:42.987
<i>An island?</i>

26
00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:45.296
<i>No phones. no work.
We grow our own food.</i>

27
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.932
<i>I wear the same thing
every day.</i>

28
00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.298
<i>I have chickens.</i>

29
00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.128
<i>- Chickens?
- Yeah. I have chickens.</i>

30
00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:52.737
<i>Seems like
you really are a changed man.</i>

31
00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.836
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

32
00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:59.409
<i>So. last year you started
the King-Tech Foundation.</i>

33
00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:01.039
<i>What do you have
to say to the critics</i>

34
00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:04.383
<i>who call your recent
philanthropy performative?</i>

35
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.781
<i>Look.
I'm just trying to do better.</i>

36
00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:09.854
<i>I don't know how else
to say that I'm sorry.</i>

37
00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.322
<i>'Cause I am sorry.</i>

38
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.559
<i>I really am.
I am... I'm sorry.</i>

39
00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.556
<i>But I've... I've said
those words so many times</i>

40
00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:20.390
<i>that they've lost meaning.</i>

41
00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:22.401
<i>Do you expect
people to forgive and forget?</i>

42
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.203
<i>I don't expect
anything from anyone.</i>

43
00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:25.870
<i>It's not the reality
that we live in.</i>

44
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.706
Hey. dude.
you got my lighter?

45
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.436
Oh. Sorry.

46
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:31.703
Hey. do you have the money?

47
00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:32.977
The super's
gonna be here soon.

48
00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.444
Right. About that...

49
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.408
- Oh. what did you do?
- It's a surprise for you.

50
00:03:36.544 --> 00:03:38.250
- Oh. boy.
- I love you.

51
00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.417
Wait. Do we have any...

52
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.883
Thanks.

53
00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:02.301
I need
a fucking vacation.

Hmm.
You're late.

60
00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:29.266
Oh. I'm sorry.

61
00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.233
I missed
the bus and...

62
00:04:31.368 --> 00:04:32.500
This is the King-Tech gala.

63
00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:34.232
the most important event
of the year.

64
00:04:34.368 --> 00:04:35.833
Can we just have a quick talk
about your behavior last year?

65
00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.602
- It was a little chatty. so...
- No.

66
00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:39.978
No. no. no. He talked to me.

67
00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:41.078
He told me he liked my nails.

68
00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:42.178
- That's it.
- Anyway...

69
00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:43.645
I just want. this time around.

70
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:45.845
you to be a little bit
more invisible. okay?

71
00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:49.519
Okay.

72
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.287
- Okay? Can you do that?
- Yes. I can do that.

73
00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:52.817
Okay.
I can.

74
00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:55.019
- And don't forget to smile.
- I won't.

75
00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.364
I missed my audition

76
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.526
waiting for the super
who never showed up.

77
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:01.826
So we still have black mold

78
00:05:01.962 --> 00:05:03.366
and I guess
we're just gonna die now.

79
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:04.594
Yo. Jess.
can I get your lighter?

80
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.604
Yes. But I want it back.

81
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.539
I'm gonna have to write
my goddamn name on that thing.

82
00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:10.703
This haircut is so stupid.
Do I look like a boy?

83
00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.544
A very cute boy.

84
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.381
I heard you sneaking out
last night at. like. 3:00 a.m.

85
00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:18.745
Where'd you go?

86
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.351
Heh.
What's wrong with you?

87
00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.014
- Don't be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

88
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.852
I just can't magically
erase shit from my brain.

89
00:05:26.953 --> 00:05:29.627
So. when you
get back together.

90
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:32.196
don't expect me to pretend
like I don't want to stab him.

91
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.164
- It's complicated.
- It's not.

92
00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:35.860
Stop giving away your power.

93
00:05:35.996 --> 00:05:37.266
You're not a human
phone charger.

94
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:38.865
Just have some self-respect.

95
00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:43.870
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.103
I love you.

97
00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:48.842
I just don't understand
why you keep going back.

98
00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:51.678
I guess I'm just scared
of being alone.

99
00:05:51.814 --> 00:05:55.380
Aw. You're not alone.
You have me.

100
00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:56.483
Mmm. Yeah.

101
00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.757
Don't forget to smile. ladies.

102
00:06:00.358 --> 00:06:01.824
<i>All right.</i>

103
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:04.927
<i>Okay. Okay. okay.
let's get serious. people.</i>

104
00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:07.796
<i>We want to thank you all
for being here with us tonight</i>

105
00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:09.929
<i>so that the King Foundation
can get on</i>

106
00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:12.036
<i>with the business
of doing good</i>

107
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.471

108
00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.034
<i>I want to give
a round of applause</i>

109
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.036

<i>- the founder of King-Tech...

112
00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:22.347
Oh. my God! Oh. my God.

113
00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:23.646
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- ...Mr. Slater King.</i>

114
00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:29.751
Careful.

115
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.717
You're gonna sprain your neck.

116
00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:34.525
I don't care if I break it.

117
00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:38.622
Ready
for your surprise?

118
00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:39.959
Oh. boy.

119
00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:45.465
- Red or blue?
- Uh...

120
00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:50.308
This is crazy.

121
00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:51.540
I know. right?

122
00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:52.871
No.
it's. like. crazy-crazy.

123
00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:54.473
We just can't really
afford to...

124
00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:56.113
Jess. don't do that.

125
00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:57.948
No. Whose time is it?

126
00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.009
Our time.

127
00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:00.550
You know what my mom
used to say?

128
00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:04.518
- Hmm?
- Success is the best revenge.

129
00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:05.852
You think he'll remember me?

130
00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:07.292
Who could forget you?

131
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.357
You know?

132
00:07:08.492 --> 00:07:09.821
- Oh. shit!
- You okay?

133
00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:12.057
Sorry.
Yeah. I just.

134
00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:13.593
I don't know how to walk
in these fucking things.

135
00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:14.660
Okay. do this thing my aunt

136
00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:15.726
- taught me. okay?
- Okay.

137
00:07:15.862 --> 00:07:19.269
East. west. east. west.

138
00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:22.033
East. west. east. west.

139
00:07:22.168 --> 00:07:24.773
East. west. east. west.
Hello.

140
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:28.612
East. east. West. east.
west. east. west...

141
00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:30.478
Oh. shit.
It's Jennifer. Fuck.

142
00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:36.853
Oh. hold up.

143
00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.786
I think it's because
people like me would touch it.

144
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:39.883
So it's smarter
for them to do that.

145
00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:41.359
I wouldn't want to ruin it.

146
00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:42.856
Ladies.
this is a private area.

147
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:44.591
Could I have you step
that way. please?

148
00:07:44.727 --> 00:07:46.256
- Oh. okay.
- Yeah. sure.

149
00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:47.960
- Hey. Stan.
- Hey. Cody. how are you doin'?

150
00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:51.596
Good.
- South. south. south.

151
00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:58.339
Hey. how much you think
that little head costs?

152
00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:00.710
Like. a million dollars?

153
00:08:02.145 --> 00:08:04.344
I wonder if that alarm would
go off if you stole...

154
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.279
Frida. Frida.

155
00:08:06.414 --> 00:08:07.618
Frida?

156
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:18.959
Shit.

157
00:08:20.894 --> 00:08:22.127
Are you all right?

158
00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:29.336
Here. may I?

159
00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:30.806
Yeah.

160
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:35.811
Saw it in a movie once.

161
00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:37.443
and I've always
wanted to do it.

162
00:08:37.578 --> 00:08:38.781
Now you're even.

163
00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:41.179
Slater.

164
00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.720
Rich!
Hey.

165
00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:45.050
the speech turned out great.

166
00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:46.654
Really? Are you sure?
I mean...

167
00:08:46.789 --> 00:08:47.953
How did it feel to be...

168
00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:49.227
Ma'am? Ma'am?
...just scared

169
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.492
- to say anything.
- Yes?

170
00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:51.893
I know. I know.

171
00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:53.290
I totally understand.
Your hand.

172
00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:54.926
I was very proud of you.
Listen.

173
00:08:55.061 --> 00:08:56.227
- you've come a long way.
- Oh.

174
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.868
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

175
00:08:59.003 --> 00:09:00.530
Listen. I'm...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

176
00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.803
No. no. You're not
interrupting. This is. um...

177
00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:05.938
Uh. I actually
haven't asked your name.

178
00:09:06.074 --> 00:09:08.206
Frida. I'm Frida.

179
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.442
Frida.

180
00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:12.549
Yeah.

181
00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.049
Uh. Frida.
this is Dr. Rich Stein.

182
00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:18.117
Um. he's...
He's actually my therapist.

183
00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:20.524
Oh.
He needs one.

184
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.753
I'm just kidding.

185
00:09:21.888 --> 00:09:22.887
Very nice to meet you.

186
00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:24.221
Blink twice if I'm in danger.

187
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:25.825
Oh. dear.
Well. maybe not.

188
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.258
Let's not answer
that one. right?

189
00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:29.960
Well.
I'll let you get back to it.

214
00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:13.205
Nice to meet you guys.

No.
- Look what I got you. babe.

223
00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:27.285
Please don't call me "babe."

224

You got all that?
It's a bit of a whirlwind.

- Seen you somewhere? No?
- No. I don't think so.

229
00:10:36.732 --> 00:10:38.297

00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:31.721
I forgot you own
your own island.

242
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.725
It's casual.

243
00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:36.121
So casual. Yeah.

Can we go?
- I gotta go.

248
00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:45.228
I need to be in a place
where I can get

249
00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:46.903

Did you see that?

253
00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:01.447
He was like...

254
00:12:02.954 --> 00:12:05.250
Another chapter
for the memoir. my dear.

255
00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:07.251
- Yeah. totally.
- Did you get his number?

256
00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:08.624
Of course I fucking didn't.
How...

257
00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:10.058
What are you talking about?

258
00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:11.727
- How does a dude like that...?
- After all that?

259
00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:12.958
I don't know.

260
00:12:13.093 --> 00:12:15.398

Good.
- Mmm-hmm.

Wait. you forgot your...

Okay.

00:16:54.074 --> 00:16:55.008
Oh. hi.

332
00:16:55.144 --> 00:16:56.343

335
00:17:02.715 --> 00:17:04.120
Right.

we're supposed to go?

337
00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:12.195
Okay.

338
00:17:15.695 --> 00:17:17.200
So do you think
the human sacrifice

339
00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:20.432
is before or after dinner?

340
00:17:20.568 --> 00:17:22.733
Oh. my God!
- Oh. my God!

341
00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:26.636
You look so good!

342
00:17:26.772 --> 00:17:29.312
I'm gonna die.
You look so good.

343
00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:32.048
Is it weird that
we're all dressed the same?

344
00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:33.380
I don't know.
It's cute.

345
00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:34.510
How'd they know
our bra size?

346
00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:35.986
They're probably gonna

347
00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:37.051
be dressed exactly
the same too.

call me the Fat Blunt Queen.

356
00:17:57.206 --> 00:17:58.305
But eventually. I wanna do

357
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.637
my own thing. you know?

358
00:17:59.772 --> 00:18:01.143
I wanna be the Slater King
of crypto.

359
00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:02.074
Hey. Vic.
you want some watermelon?

360
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.343
Thank you.

361
00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:04.808

362
00:18:04.944 --> 00:18:06.745
- There's not gonna be dollars.
- Little chewy.

363
00:18:06.881 --> 00:18:08.985
What? What do you mean
it's a little chewy?

364
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.313
Why do you always
gotta do that?

365

366

Pssh. What are we looking at?

367
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.594
Two eyes.

368
00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.394
three little buttons.

369
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:26.132
- two arms.
- Oh.

00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:27.634

Oh. yeah.

372
00:18:33.513 --> 00:18:34.445

Go off. HSB!

378
00:18:51.024 --> 00:18:53.962
Oh. I knew it. You were
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes.</i>

379
00:18:54.097 --> 00:18:55.564
Eight seasons.

380
00:18:55.699 --> 00:18:58.499
Yo. you went cuckoo for
Cocoa Puffs on that show.

381
00:18:58.634 --> 00:19:00.501
Well.
they edit a lot of shit out.

382
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.208
And I did what I had
to do to survive.

383
00:19:06.439 --> 00:19:07.739

You okay?

389
00:19:37.402 --> 00:19:38.335
Frida. you okay?

390
00:19:42.644 --> 00:19:44.211
You scared me
for a second.

Hmm.

Desideria.

395
00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:03.894
It actually only grows here.

396
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:05.969
- Oh.
- We got a beautiful

397
00:20:06.105 --> 00:20:08.400
little herb garden over here.

398
00:20:08.535 --> 00:20:10.868
Got our chickens.

399
00:20:12.238 --> 00:20:14.244
You know.

400
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.742
it's not what I thought
it was gonna be.

401
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.908
What do you mean?

402
00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:21.511
The legendary parties
of Slater King

403
00:20:21.647 --> 00:20:24.152
with drugs and debauchery.

404
00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:25.251
We still do drugs.

405
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:30.091
We just do them
with intention.

406
00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:31.656
And we still have fun.

407
00:20:31.792 --> 00:20:33.791
It's just a little
different now.

408
00:20:33.926 --> 00:20:36.326
Therapy changed my life.

409
00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:38.062
Thanks. guys.

410
00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:41.503
Yeah. we have a bit of
a pest problem at the moment.

411
00:20:42.336 --> 00:20:43.433
It's a lash viper.

412
00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:46.009
I feel bad killing them.

413
00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.872
but they're kind of a problem.

414
00:20:49.113 --> 00:20:50.241
Are you in therapy?

415
00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:51.745
Oh. no. No.

416
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.745
I think therapy is kind of
self-indulgent bullshit.

417
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.749
You sound exactly
like my sister.

418
00:20:56.884 --> 00:20:58.619
Why should I pay to tell
someone about the time

419
00:20:58.755 --> 00:21:00.953
my mom tried to kill herself
in front of me?

420
00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:03.392
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:05.057
It's fine. I survived.
I'm still here.

422
00:21:05.192 --> 00:21:06.396
Yeah.

423
00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.496
But I agree with you on
the whole talk therapy thing.

424
00:21:10.632 --> 00:21:11.929
That's not really
what I'm into.

425
00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:14.866
Rich is more of. like.
a trauma therapist.

426
00:21:15.001 --> 00:21:18.441
Uh. you know. specializes
in repressed memory.

427
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.443
What can't you remember?

428
00:21:21.578 --> 00:21:25.079
Uh. pretty much
anything before 10.

429
00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:26.876
So I imagine it was

430
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:29.548
probably pretty bad?

431
00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:31.789
Why would you
want to remember?

432
00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:33.291
I'd pay to forget.

433
00:21:34.158 --> 00:21:35.388
Maybe you're right.

434
00:21:35.523 --> 00:21:37.193
Maybe forgetting is a gift.

435
00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:38.888
Oh. God.
- Oh. shit.

436
00:21:39.024 --> 00:21:40.295
Don't even bother.
She's got it.

437
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.426
No. no.
Let me help you.

438
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:42.994
No. no. no. I got it.

439
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.495
She's physically
incapable of accepting help.

440
00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:47.030
Relax. you're on vacation.

441
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:49.767
Oh. Slater. uh.

442
00:21:49.903 --> 00:21:52.207
I had them put the chair
in the new spot.

443
00:21:52.343 --> 00:21:53.571
- Okay.
- So let me know

444
00:21:53.707 --> 00:21:55.311
if it seems less weird there.

445
00:21:55.446 --> 00:21:57.113
- Okay.
- I think it looks nice.

446
00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:59.647
Uh. also. um. the vape liquid.

447
00:21:59.782 --> 00:22:00.877
I put in your desk.
All right.

448
00:22:01.012 --> 00:22:02.615
And one more.
Yeah?

449
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.581
The new generator
is not working.

450
00:22:04.716 --> 00:22:06.016
So I had all the candles.

451
00:22:06.151 --> 00:22:07.585
uh. laid out in the...
in the dining room.

452
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:08.652
Okay.
- Okay?

453
00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.493
Appreciate you. I love you.

454
00:22:11.327 --> 00:22:13.397
I love you too.

455
00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:18.930
Oh. my God.

456
00:22:19.065 --> 00:22:23.071
I haven't
seen you in years.

457
00:22:23.206 --> 00:22:24.942
It's been decades.

458
00:22:25.078 --> 00:22:26.243
Do you come here often?

459
00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:28.342
- Oh. all the time.
- Oh. of course.

460
00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:30.007
This is where I reside now.

461
00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:32.180
This is my home.

462
00:22:32.316 --> 00:22:34.144
East. west. east...

463
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.521
Friends. tonight
we have zucchini blossoms.

464
00:22:37.657 --> 00:22:41.456
fresh from the organic garden
right here at Chez King.

465
00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:43.586
We have a yuca
mofongo croquetas.

466
00:22:43.722 --> 00:22:45.022
which is deep-fried. uh.

467
00:22:45.157 --> 00:22:46.894
which is a little bit
naughty.

468
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.427
And. of course. we have this
beautifully dry-aged steak.

469
00:22:50.563 --> 00:22:51.965
Blessings. Enjoy.

470
00:22:52.101 --> 00:22:53.404
Oh. Wow.

471
00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:55.800
Everybody raise your glasses
for Camilla here.

472
00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:57.674
No. don't do that.
Yep.

473
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.077
She just finalized the sale
of her app as of yesterday.

474
00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:01.741
Welcome to King-Tech. girl.

475
00:23:01.876 --> 00:23:04.081
Thank you. Thanks. guys.

476
00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:05.515
What's it... How does it work?

477
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.643
It's an astrology thing.
It's called The Cycle.

478
00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:09.046
Dude. it's awesome.

479
00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:11.388
You put in your birth time
and location.

480
00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:12.786
Mmm-hmm.
And it tells you

481
00:23:12.921 --> 00:23:14.887
that the reason that
your sitcom got canceled

482
00:23:15.022 --> 00:23:16.788
and your wife is sucking
the neighbor's dick

483
00:23:16.924 --> 00:23:18.855
while you're eating eggs
to slim down

484
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.263
so that somebody
will fuck you...

485
00:23:21.398 --> 00:23:22.597
...is because

486
00:23:22.732 --> 00:23:24.964
the planet Saturn
is trying to teach you

487
00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:27.900
how to process your emotions
in a healthier way.

488
00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:31.842
I'm glad
you're finding it helpful.

489
00:23:31.978 --> 00:23:32.971
It's awesome.

490
00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:35.446
Buddy.

491
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.707
Ah. I just love cooking
for my friends.

492
00:23:37.843 --> 00:23:39.111
It just hits different.

493
00:23:39.613 --> 00:23:40.779
Looks beautiful. Cody.

494
00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:42.579
Yeah.
dig into the steak. guys.

495
00:23:42.715 --> 00:23:44.452
- Mmm.
- Dude.

496
00:23:44.587 --> 00:23:46.088
- Can I have some salt?
- Really?

497
00:23:46.223 --> 00:23:48.184
Yeah. It needs it.

498
00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:49.955
- You want one?
- No. I don't eat red meat.

499
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.992
Oh. Sorry.
This place is insane.

500
00:23:53.128 --> 00:23:54.394
So pretty.
Give me the pepper too.

501
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:55.762
Fuck you. Vic.

502
00:23:55.898 --> 00:23:57.093
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

503
00:23:57.228 --> 00:23:59.498
I'm glad you're having
a good... Ooh.

504
00:23:59.634 --> 00:24:01.098
You got. like. a little...

505
00:24:03.404 --> 00:24:04.404
Uh-oh!

506
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.903
Kool-Aid on the cult robe.

507
00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:07.941
Oh.
Oopsie-daisy.

508
00:24:08.076 --> 00:24:09.876
Don't worry about it.
It's fine. You're good.

509
00:24:14.854 --> 00:24:17.681
So. uh. Sarah. are...
are you gonna be on <i>All-Stars?</i>

510
00:24:17.816 --> 00:24:19.457
I was gonna be. yeah.

511
00:24:19.592 --> 00:24:22.489
But. after 22 years.
they've just decided

512
00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:24.592
a show about girls in bikinis

513
00:24:24.728 --> 00:24:26.329
fighting for their lives
in the jungle

514
00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:27.662
is exploitative.

515
00:24:27.797 --> 00:24:29.293
And I'm. like...
Smell that. babe.

516
00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:30.665
Wow.

517
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:34.204
Yeah. so two years
of training for nothing.

518
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.537
I'm sure it'll come in handy.

519
00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:41.844
Oh. that's gonna
open up beautifully.

520
00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:44.812
So. uh. Frida. when you're
not staining your clothes.

521
00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:46.914
what else do you do?

522
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.284
Um... [stutters] Well.
I'm just... I'm just trying

523
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.782
to figure it out.

524
00:24:52.917 --> 00:24:54.386
Figuring it out. huh?

525
00:24:54.522 --> 00:24:55.455
Yeah.

526
00:24:55.591 --> 00:24:57.054
Let me know how that goes.

527
00:24:57.189 --> 00:24:58.760
Yeah. I guess
I just. you know.

528
00:24:58.895 --> 00:25:00.123
don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

529
00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:02.125
You know. Vic here
has a Harvard degree

530
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.959
in not knowing
what the fuck he's doing.

531
00:25:04.095 --> 00:25:05.628
Ask him how he lost his pinky.

532
00:25:05.764 --> 00:25:07.132
Yeah.

533
00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:10.539
No. What's the big deal?
I'm just asking questions.

534
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.409
I like our new friend
Frida here.

535
00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:13.974
I think she's cool
and interesting.

536
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.309
I just want to get to know
her better. that's all.

537
00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:17.075
All right.

538
00:25:17.211 --> 00:25:19.847
Hey. hey. hey!
Sip it. dude. Sip it.

539
00:25:20.682 --> 00:25:22.179
The wine's older than you.

540
00:25:23.518 --> 00:25:25.215
Yeah. s... sorry.

541
00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:30.627
Offerings.
Time for the real dessert.

542
00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:35.763
These beautiful psilocybin
and MDMA droppies

543
00:25:35.898 --> 00:25:38.268
will introduce you
to your ancestors.

544
00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:39.568
Yeah.

545
00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.198
Blessings.
children of the forest.

546
00:25:42.503 --> 00:25:43.706
Who's first?

547
00:25:44.802 --> 00:25:45.906
Uh...

548
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:47.407
How many do I do?

549
00:25:47.543 --> 00:25:49.105
Come here.

550
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.308
He's the master.

551
00:25:54.782 --> 00:25:57.181
Uh-uh. Set your intention.

552
00:26:04.691 --> 00:26:05.992
One.

553
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:08.126
Two.

554
00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:09.693
Three.

555
00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:11.398
I love you so much.

556
00:26:11.534 --> 00:26:13.028
I love you so much.

557
00:26:13.164 --> 00:26:16.304
I fucking love this pineapple.

558
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.041
You're so beautiful.

559
00:26:20.476 --> 00:26:21.443
Wow.

560
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:33.720
Okay. Sleep.

561
00:26:33.856 --> 00:26:36.088
Okay. Okay.

562
00:26:42.331 --> 00:26:43.326
Huh.

563
00:26:46.698 --> 00:26:47.938
Weird.

564
00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:49.068
What?

565
00:26:51.043 --> 00:26:52.071
Nothing.

566
00:27:01.216 --> 00:27:03.386
John Kennedy was here.
Yeah.

567
00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:04.785
Blue fin. Belly cut.

568
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:06.284
Best in the world.
Mmm.

569
00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:07.784
Whoa. Cody.
I mean. this is sick.

570
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.493
Very special knife.

571
00:27:09.629 --> 00:27:11.161
Slater got it for me
in Okinawa.

572
00:27:11.297 --> 00:27:12.588
And it's very sharp.

573
00:27:12.724 --> 00:27:14.396
I just don't want you to cut
yourself. all right. dude?

574
00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:16.129
It's an original Hattori.

575
00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:17.760
He decides to throw
himself a birthday party.

576
00:27:24.473 --> 00:27:25.676
Thank you.

577
00:27:41.189 --> 00:27:44.388
There's something weird
going on here.

578
00:27:44.523 --> 00:27:47.698
If by weird. you mean
that you're losing. again?

579
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.993
Yeah. shit's getting
pretty fucking weird.

580
00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:52.097
What happened to your pinky?

581
00:27:52.232 --> 00:27:54.364
What's the first rule
of Fight Club?

582
00:27:59.606 --> 00:28:01.007
What?

583
00:28:01.143 --> 00:28:03.978
Never mind. Here we go.
<i>One.</i>

584
00:28:04.447 --> 00:28:05.345
<i>Two.</i>

585
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.578

586
00:28:06.713 --> 00:28:08.317
<i>Four.</i>

587
00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:09.852
Five.

588
00:28:11.453 --> 00:28:12.987
Six.

589
00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:16.122
Seven.

590
00:28:17.327 --> 00:28:18.861
Eight.

591
00:28:19.527 --> 00:28:20.995
Nine.

592
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:23.893
Ten!

593
00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:29.971
No! No. no. no!

594
00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:34.642
Hold it.

595
00:28:34.778 --> 00:28:37.407
I'm not... I'm not prepared...

596
00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:13.911
Having a good time?

597
00:29:14.047 --> 00:29:15.918
We're having a great time.

598
00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.418
Babe.

599
00:29:23.056 --> 00:29:24.960
Watermelon?

600
00:29:28.864 --> 00:29:30.995
That is a fat blunt. queen.

601
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.265
Does anyone have a lighter?

602
00:29:38.976 --> 00:29:40.877
Heather. do you have
my lighter?

603
00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:45.442
Sorry.

604
00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.902
Can I try?
Yeah.

605
00:30:17.014 --> 00:30:18.414
What is that?

606
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.147
Is it. like. strawberry?

607
00:30:22.817 --> 00:30:24.217
Ooh.

608
00:30:25.183 --> 00:30:27.186
That smells nice on you.

609
00:30:27.321 --> 00:30:30.157
Thank you.
Mmm.

610
00:30:39.934 --> 00:30:41.597
How'd you get that scar?

611
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.407
I don't know.

612
00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:04.092
I like your nails.

613
00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:06.325
Thanks.

614
00:31:07.763 --> 00:31:09.366
I do them myself.

615
00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:10.527
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:12.929
All right.
What do we got here?

617
00:31:13.064 --> 00:31:14.370
Blue cats.

618
00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:17.105
Yeah. Anailmals.

619
00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:19.409
What?

620
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:23.074
It's. um. anailmals.

621
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.278
It's animal nails.

622
00:31:26.578 --> 00:31:28.783
It's kind of my thing.
It's. um...

623
00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:30.918
- It's a play on...
- Oh. oh!

624
00:31:31.053 --> 00:31:32.854
- You get it?
- Fuck! Yes.

625
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.359
-"A-nail-mals."
- Anailmals.

626
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.630
I gotta go to bed.

627
00:31:45.766 --> 00:31:48.096
I gotta go to bed.
- What?

628
00:31:48.232 --> 00:31:50.336
Why?

629
00:31:50.472 --> 00:31:52.375
I got therapy in the morning.

630
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.675
Oh. boo.

631
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.176
Oh. boo. you.

632
00:31:56.846 --> 00:31:58.146
Wait. You forgot your...

633
00:32:16.533 --> 00:32:17.528
Ew.

634
00:32:36.784 --> 00:32:37.988
Hello?

635
00:32:51.997 --> 00:32:53.201
Hello?

636
00:33:15.825 --> 00:33:16.919
Frida?

637
00:33:17.055 --> 00:33:18.424
Hi.

638
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.624
Hey.

639
00:33:21.898 --> 00:33:24.063
I. um...

640
00:33:24.199 --> 00:33:25.766
I thought you might want this.

641
00:33:25.902 --> 00:33:27.499
Thank you. That's sweet.

642
00:33:28.132 --> 00:33:29.501
So...

643
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.206
Whatcha doin'?
Oh. man.

644
00:33:32.341 --> 00:33:35.010
Oh. look who it is.

645
00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.410
Frida. this is Rich.
Hi.

646
00:33:37.945 --> 00:33:38.978
Rich. Frida.

647
00:33:39.113 --> 00:33:40.781
Very nice to meet you.

648
00:33:40.916 --> 00:33:42.382
I remember you.

649
00:33:43.083 --> 00:33:44.483
From the gala?

650
00:33:45.652 --> 00:33:47.585
"Blink twice
if I'm in danger"?

651
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.094
That's right.

652
00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:52.656
That's right.

653
00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.565
Amazing.

654
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:56.725
Yeah. it's amazing.

655
00:33:56.861 --> 00:33:59.469
Hey. Stace?
It still feels weird here.

656
00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:00.597
Okay.

657
00:34:00.732 --> 00:34:02.302
I think we should try it
someplace else.

658
00:34:02.437 --> 00:34:05.206
Why don't we just
light it on fire?

659
00:34:05.342 --> 00:34:07.338
That might make it
a little less weird.

660
00:34:07.473 --> 00:34:08.804
Don't do that.
- Hi.

661
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.109
Don't... Don't do that.
You know it bums me out.

662
00:34:11.245 --> 00:34:13.417
- All right?
- Ah.

663
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:14.711
I'm sorry.

664
00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:17.053
All right. young man.

665
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:19.219
I'm headed back
to the mountaintop.

666
00:34:19.354 --> 00:34:20.820
- Always enjoy our chats.
- Yes. sir.

667
00:34:20.956 --> 00:34:22.390
Thank you.

668
00:34:22.526 --> 00:34:26.029
- Oh. and thanks for the gift.
- I'll walk you out.

669
00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.691
Hey. hon.
do you have the light?

670
00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:33.433
Where's my knife?
Who has my knife?

671
00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:35.698
What?

672
00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:37.338
My knife.
I can't find my special knife.

673
00:34:37.473 --> 00:34:39.376
Chill. You just
gotta ask somebody. man.

674
00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:40.236
You okay?

675
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:41.705
Psst.

676
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:44.013
Has anyone seen
Cody's special knife?

677
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:45.775
I just don't know
where it went.

678
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.944
You want this?

679
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.017
No. thanks. Heather.
That weed makes me paranoid.

680
00:34:50.153 --> 00:34:52.155
Nobody has your stupid knife.

681
00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:16.773
Something horrible
is about to happen.

682
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.382
What?

683
00:35:23.283 --> 00:35:25.122
When things are good.

684
00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:28.257
that's when
the bad stuff happens.

685
00:35:31.823 --> 00:35:33.394
Why would you
think that?

686
00:35:34.929 --> 00:35:36.133
Life.

687
00:35:40.904 --> 00:35:42.370
What day is it?

688
00:35:44.974 --> 00:35:46.341
I don't know.

689
00:35:47.142 --> 00:35:48.442
When are we leaving?

690
00:35:50.441 --> 00:35:51.781
Whenever you want.

691
00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.249
That's not an answer.

692
00:35:54.678 --> 00:35:56.450
Are you having a good time?

693
00:35:56.918 --> 00:35:57.847
Yes.

694
00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:01.323
Good.

695
00:36:03.388 --> 00:36:05.822
Boop.

696
00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:29.347
Okay. who has got it?

697
00:36:29.483 --> 00:36:32.381
Who has got it this time. huh?

698
00:36:32.516 --> 00:36:34.653
- Not it.
- Oops.

699
00:36:36.393 --> 00:36:37.953
I don't even remember
taking it.

700
00:36:38.088 --> 00:36:41.024
- I know who took it.
- Eh. eh. oh. ah! Oh!

701
00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:43.392
What. do I gotta write my name
on this fucking thing?

702
00:36:43.528 --> 00:36:44.694
Oh. shit.

703
00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.330
Pop Rocks in a tangerine
mojito sorbet.

704
00:36:50.369 --> 00:36:51.871
Shut up! Shut up!

705
00:36:52.006 --> 00:36:52.938
I got it.

706
00:36:53.073 --> 00:36:54.310
I got it.

707
00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.277
I got it.

708
00:36:56.413 --> 00:36:57.141
Let's go!
Yes!

709
00:36:59.015 --> 00:37:00.016
Love it!

710
00:37:02.215 --> 00:37:03.984
Yeah!

711
00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:06.982
<i>♪ What's the sense in sharing
This one and only life... ♪</i>

712
00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:08.918
That's right!

713
00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:13.461
All of this feels immaculate.

714
00:37:13.597 --> 00:37:15.628
Oh. my goodness. Okay.

715
00:37:17.963 --> 00:37:20.330
Beautiful photo!
Hold it right there.

716
00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:21.566
All right. Yep.

717
00:37:21.701 --> 00:37:22.965
Hold it. Hold it.

718
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.771

I believe the word

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.263
kid. is "fucking awesome."

747
00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.760
What is it?
Is it poisonous?

748
00:38:55.895 --> 00:38:57.398
It's venomous.
but you're not gonna die.

749
00:38:57.534 --> 00:38:58.729
Oh. my God!
- No. no. no.

750
00:38:58.865 --> 00:39:00.437
Is it dead?
Here. Here.

751
00:39:00.572 --> 00:39:01.465
You're okay. You're fine.

752
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:03.167
Oh. my god!

753
00:39:03.302 --> 00:39:04.866
Should I. like. be going to.
like. a hospital or something?

754
00:39:05.001 --> 00:39:07.102
You'll be fine.
Besides...

755
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.810
there are no hospitals.

756
00:39:15.748 --> 00:39:17.112
You want
some more water?

757
00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:22.385
How's your hand?

758
00:39:22.521 --> 00:39:23.921
I feel weird.

759
00:39:26.425 --> 00:39:27.655
I want my phone.

760
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:29.058
Okay.

761
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:31.968
I wanna go home.

762
00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:33.370
Okay. let's not go crazy.

763
00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:35.965
Everybody is. like.
smiling and laughing

764
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.000
like 1960s fucking
flight attendants.

765
00:39:38.135 --> 00:39:39.773
Like. "Are you having
a good time?"

766
00:39:39.909 --> 00:39:41.807
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm having
a great time."

767
00:39:42.574 --> 00:39:45.712
I'm scared. Frida.

768
00:39:45.848 --> 00:39:47.409
I think
you just need some sleep.

769
00:39:47.544 --> 00:39:51.382
Don't. No. no. don't. don't.
don't do that. Don't do that.

770
00:39:53.686 --> 00:39:55.491
Can't you feel it?

771
00:39:57.121 --> 00:40:01.530
There's something wrong
with this place.

772
00:40:04.629 --> 00:40:05.968
What's wrong?

773
00:40:08.671 --> 00:40:10.968
What's wrong?
I seriously want to know.

774
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.773
Is it the amazing food?

775
00:40:13.908 --> 00:40:16.212
Or the tsunami of champagne?

776
00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:18.543
Or is it
the 1.020-thread-count

777
00:40:18.678 --> 00:40:20.149
fucking sheets? What is it?

778
00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.847
You're not listening to me.

779
00:40:22.316 --> 00:40:23.519
Please.

780
00:40:24.285 --> 00:40:25.488
Please.

781
00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:29.459
For the first time
in my life. I'm here.

782
00:40:30.824 --> 00:40:32.026
And
I'm not invisible.

783
00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:33.694
So please.

784
00:40:34.427 --> 00:40:35.828
Please.

785
00:40:40.236 --> 00:40:41.438
I'm sorry.

786
00:40:44.338 --> 00:40:45.541
I'm sorry.

787
00:40:46.042 --> 00:40:47.004
Yeah.

788
00:40:47.439 --> 00:40:48.643
Okay.

789
00:40:53.978 --> 00:40:55.579
I'm gonna go lay down.

790
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.564
Hello?

791
00:42:55.436 --> 00:42:56.705
Oh.

792
00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.906
Hi.

793
00:43:01.207 --> 00:43:04.477
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just. um...

794
00:43:04.612 --> 00:43:05.813
I was looking for Slater.

795
00:43:06.446 --> 00:43:07.650
Um...

796
00:43:08.679 --> 00:43:09.883
Hey.

797
00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.721
What's your name?

798
00:43:13.718 --> 00:43:15.091
Red rabbit.

799
00:43:15.226 --> 00:43:16.725
Red rabbit. right.

800
00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:20.058
Oh.

801
00:43:22.192 --> 00:43:24.364
Oh. Don't worry. I won't tell.

802
00:43:24.499 --> 00:43:25.800
I'm not a narc.

803
00:43:28.237 --> 00:43:29.265
Sure.

804
00:43:36.707 --> 00:43:40.716
Oh. my God. what's in that?
That's crazy strong!

805
00:43:44.485 --> 00:43:46.117
Red rabbit.

806
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.721
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

807
00:43:50.857 --> 00:43:53.963
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

808
00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.093
Red...

809
00:44:01.803 --> 00:44:03.466
What are you doing over here?

810
00:44:03.602 --> 00:44:04.806
I. uh...

811
00:44:06.837 --> 00:44:08.475
I got lost.

812
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.108
You wanna go that way.

813
00:44:12.045 --> 00:44:14.216
Oh. the chickens got out.
Again.

814
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:15.850
Fucking nightmare.

815
00:44:23.693 --> 00:44:25.124
Come here. you little fucker.

816
00:44:30.364 --> 00:44:32.262
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait!

817
00:44:34.064 --> 00:44:35.804
Why are we running?

818
00:44:47.478 --> 00:44:49.719
I don't know
why we do that.

819
00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:53.690
Hide this.

820
00:45:38.497 --> 00:45:40.935
All right. who did this?

821
00:45:42.768 --> 00:45:44.268
Seriously.

822
00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:49.306
When did I cut bangs?

823
00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:56.783
What's up?

824
00:45:56.919 --> 00:45:58.517
You've got a dick
on your face.

825
00:45:58.652 --> 00:46:00.154
Yep.

826
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.618
Greetings. excellent people.
Good morning.

I'm sorry. Slate.

828
00:46:04.355 --> 00:46:06.387
- Hi. guys.

What?
Oh. no. I know. right?

830
00:46:08.396 --> 00:46:10.160
Oh. my God. Fuck. yeah.
There's blueberry muffins?

831
00:46:10.296 --> 00:46:11.928
It's
Slate's mom's recipe.

832
00:46:12.063 --> 00:46:14.299
Mmm. It's spectacular.

833
00:46:14.434 --> 00:46:15.970
Thanks. bud.
How'd you sleep?

834
00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:17.934
Amazing.

835
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.308
All right. kids.

836
00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.107
Sails up.

837
00:46:21.243 --> 00:46:23.676
Who's ready to catch
some beautiful grouper?

838
00:46:23.812 --> 00:46:25.241
Let's do it. Is it cool

839
00:46:25.377 --> 00:46:26.513
if I bring the muffins?

840
00:46:26.649 --> 00:46:27.749
Bring the muffins.

841
00:46:27.884 --> 00:46:29.682
Oh. how do we feel
about less loud?

842
00:46:29.818 --> 00:46:31.384
Sorry. babe.

843
00:46:31.519 --> 00:46:33.615
I don't think I can be on a
boat right now. to be honest.

844
00:46:33.751 --> 00:46:35.118
Come on. it'll be fun.

845
00:46:35.253 --> 00:46:37.386
- Big old bucket of worms.
- Oh.

846
00:46:37.522 --> 00:46:40.126
Maybe we'll just have
some girl time.

847
00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:43.798
You guys go
be with the worms.

848
00:46:43.933 --> 00:46:45.797
- You okay if I go?
- Of course.

849
00:46:45.933 --> 00:46:47.199
- You sure?
- Yeah.

850
00:46:47.334 --> 00:46:48.704
Tom. is that
a dick on your face?

851
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.802
Yep.
- Enjoy your girl time.

852
00:46:49.938 --> 00:46:51.269
Mm-hmm.
Bye. babe.

853
00:46:51.405 --> 00:46:53.535
Bye. babe!

854
00:46:55.941 --> 00:46:57.679
Oh. I needed this!

855
00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.848
- Me the fuck too.
- Oh. my God!

856
00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:02.278
You want this?
- Oh. fuck no.

857
00:47:02.414 --> 00:47:03.950

Thank you.

862
00:47:13.563 --> 00:47:15.022
Where's Jess?

863
00:47:15.158 --> 00:47:17.094
What do you mean?

864
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.000
What do you mean.
"What do I mean?"

865
00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:23.103
Jess.

866
00:47:28.104 --> 00:47:30.011
Who is Jess?

867
00:47:35.814 --> 00:47:37.117
You okay?

868
00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.253
Is she okay?

869
00:47:42.686 --> 00:47:44.824
You don't look so good.
What's wrong?

870
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.423
Yeah. what's wrong?

871
00:47:49.765 --> 00:47:51.263
Are you fucking with me?

872
00:47:53.298 --> 00:47:54.970
- Where's Jess?
- Huh? What. hon?

873
00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.664
My friend that was
in the room next to mine.

874
00:47:56.799 --> 00:47:59.436
Uh. the storage room?

875
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:02.905
Hey. relax.
You're on vacation.

876
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.342
Oh. Jesus.

877
00:48:20.562 --> 00:48:21.590
Wake up!

878
00:48:23.763 --> 00:48:25.292
Wake up!

879
00:48:25.428 --> 00:48:28.201
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

880
00:48:59.768 --> 00:49:01.233
Jess was here.

881
00:49:01.369 --> 00:49:02.904
Jess was here!
Hmm.

882
00:49:03.039 --> 00:49:04.565
And she said...
She said

883
00:49:04.701 --> 00:49:06.068
there was something wrong
with this place.

884
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:07.405
I hear you.

885
00:49:09.345 --> 00:49:12.245
And I don't want to sound
like... like a bitch.

886
00:49:13.446 --> 00:49:16.549
It's just. like.
I feel like I would know

887
00:49:16.684 --> 00:49:19.616
if there was. like. this whole
other person here. you know?

888
00:49:19.751 --> 00:49:22.121
I know
it doesn't make any sense.

889
00:49:22.256 --> 00:49:23.893
It doesn't make
any sense. but...

890
00:49:24.028 --> 00:49:25.224
I feel like...
I feel like

891
00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:27.491
we're forgetting.
like. a lot of stuff.

892
00:49:27.627 --> 00:49:31.561
How do we feel about
putting down the knife?

893
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:34.696
Yeah?

894
00:49:35.803 --> 00:49:37.532
Yeah. I'm sorry.

895
00:49:37.668 --> 00:49:40.075
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

896
00:49:41.811 --> 00:49:42.774
It's okay.

897
00:49:42.909 --> 00:49:44.178
I'm sorry.

898
00:49:46.709 --> 00:49:48.149
What day is it?

899
00:49:49.145 --> 00:49:50.349
Huh?

900
00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:53.550
Do you know what day it is?

901
00:49:55.657 --> 00:49:56.652
No.

902
00:49:58.888 --> 00:50:01.261
But. like. I never know
what day it is.

903
00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:03.527
Right.

904
00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:07.069
I'm having a great time here.

905
00:50:11.709 --> 00:50:13.141
But I also have this

906
00:50:14.074 --> 00:50:15.539
feeling that I'm. like...

907
00:50:18.042 --> 00:50:19.510
not.

908
00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:23.917
- Does that make sense?
- Yes.

909
00:50:24.052 --> 00:50:25.117
I have dirt under my nails.

910
00:50:25.252 --> 00:50:26.649
and I don't know
how it got there.

911
00:50:27.784 --> 00:50:30.125
I'm sorry.
What is this?

912
00:50:31.024 --> 00:50:32.358
What is that?

913
00:50:32.494 --> 00:50:33.955
They were like...
"Oh. Sarah...

914
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.459
you were climbing up a tree
and you were so wasted.

915
00:50:36.595 --> 00:50:38.030
you fell."
Uh-mmm.

916
00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:39.431
I didn't last eight seasons

917
00:50:39.566 --> 00:50:41.770
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes</i>
because I fell.

918
00:50:41.906 --> 00:50:43.171
So you don't think I'm crazy?

919
00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:46.041
What's crazy is that
we got onto a plane

920
00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:48.404
with a bunch of dudes
we don't know.

921
00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:50.312
I thought
you all knew each other.

922
00:50:50.448 --> 00:50:51.443
No.

923
00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:57.646
Cody just chatted me up
at a coffee shop.

924
00:50:57.782 --> 00:51:00.153
just talking about
how he knew Slater King.

925
00:51:00.288 --> 00:51:02.153
But Heather and Camilla.

926
00:51:02.288 --> 00:51:03.455
they know everybody. right?

927
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.755
I don't know.

928
00:51:15.232 --> 00:51:16.300
Oh. my God!

929
00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:17.839
What the fuck
were we thinking?

930
00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:19.442
- Oh. fuck!
- I knew it!

931
00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:20.643
I knew it!

932
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:21.735
I knew it! I knew it!

933
00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:23.309
I knew it was
too good to be true.

934
00:51:23.444 --> 00:51:24.912
Of course they're fucking
with our heads

935
00:51:25.047 --> 00:51:26.446
because that's what they do.

936
00:51:26.581 --> 00:51:29.614
They distract us with
these cute little outfits.

937
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.655
and they shower us with
raspberries and champagne.

938
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:34.715
But you know what?

939
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:36.858
We know
what's really going on.

940
00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:39.160
They are trying to control us.

941
00:51:39.295 --> 00:51:42.296
They're trying
to make us look crazy.

942
00:51:48.904 --> 00:51:50.106
And it's working.

943
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:56.706
So they're making us forget.

944
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.712
Yeah.

945
00:51:58.848 --> 00:51:59.874
Okay. but like...

946
00:52:00.815 --> 00:52:01.810
how?

947
00:52:06.858 --> 00:52:08.388
"Forgetting is a gift."

948
00:52:10.286 --> 00:52:11.489
Huh?

949
00:52:11.624 --> 00:52:14.724
Slater said.
"Forgetting is a gift."

950
00:52:15.698 --> 00:52:16.858
Oh...

951
00:52:20.133 --> 00:52:21.770
I don't get it.

952
00:52:31.376 --> 00:52:32.777
We need to call the cops.

953
00:52:32.913 --> 00:52:33.982
Yes.

954
00:52:34.118 --> 00:52:35.644
- We need to call the FBI.
- Yes.

955
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.917
We need to call the cops
and the FBI.

956
00:52:38.052 --> 00:52:38.952
Okay. but wait.

957
00:52:39.088 --> 00:52:41.190
- What?
- Wait. wait.

958
00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:42.722
Say we call the cops
and the FBI. right?

959
00:52:42.857 --> 00:52:43.951
Uh-huh...

960
00:52:44.086 --> 00:52:46.455
And we're. like.
"Hi. Hello. Please send help.

961
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:47.689
"Slater King and his buddies

962
00:52:47.824 --> 00:52:49.759
are doing
horrible things to us."

963
00:52:49.894 --> 00:52:52.165
They're gonna be like.
"What did they do?"

964
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.895
And we're gonna be like.
"Um...

965
00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:55.897
We don't know."

966
00:52:56.032 --> 00:52:57.632
"'Cause they've been
secretly erasing memories

967
00:52:57.767 --> 00:52:59.767
with perfume. I guess."

968
00:52:59.903 --> 00:53:02.073
And the guys
would be like. "What?"

969
00:53:02.209 --> 00:53:03.476
"We would never do that.

970
00:53:03.611 --> 00:53:04.839
other white guys
we probably play golf with."

971
00:53:04.975 --> 00:53:06.111
And Heather and Camilla
will be like.

972
00:53:06.247 --> 00:53:07.546
"Nothing but good times

973
00:53:07.681 --> 00:53:09.483
and fat fucking blunts
over here. officer."

974
00:53:09.618 --> 00:53:12.316
And I'll be like.
"Come on. guys. believe women."

975
00:53:12.452 --> 00:53:13.717
"Here is my friend's lighter."

976
00:53:13.852 --> 00:53:15.389
And they'll be like.
"Sure thing. Of course."

977
00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:17.787
"You crazy fucking bitch."

978
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:20.996
Okay. Okay. Okay.

979
00:53:21.132 --> 00:53:22.295
Look at me.
Okay.

980
00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:23.558
- Let's get on the same page.
- Okay.

981
00:53:23.694 --> 00:53:25.229
Your friend. you remember her?

982
00:53:25.364 --> 00:53:26.600
Yes.

983
00:53:27.303 --> 00:53:29.568
- But I don't remember her.
- No.

984
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:33.242
What's up with that?

985
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:37.576
She got bit by a snake.

986
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.283
Okay?

987
00:53:42.787 --> 00:53:43.945
And I drank this.

988
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.385
What's in there?

989
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.817
I'm pretty sure
it's snake venom.

990
00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:52.019
You think snake venom's
gonna make us remember?

991
00:53:52.388 --> 00:53:53.592
Yeah.

992
00:53:55.391 --> 00:53:56.595
Fuck it.

993
00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.601
- Yeah.
- Oh. God!

994
00:54:02.736 --> 00:54:05.371
- It's really bad.
- Oh. that's... That's venom?

995
00:54:05.507 --> 00:54:07.306
- Yeah. dude.
- Why didn't you warn me?

996
00:54:07.442 --> 00:54:09.104
- I did.
- That is disgusting.

997
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.845
How are we gonna get Heather
and Camilla to drink that?

998
00:54:11.981 --> 00:54:13.777
Oh. man.

999
00:54:14.817 --> 00:54:15.812
Tequila?

1000
00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.787
Shots. bitches!

1001
00:54:29.861 --> 00:54:32.499
Holy shit!
- What's in these?

1002
00:54:33.265 --> 00:54:34.435
Snake venom?

1003
00:54:43.244 --> 00:54:44.775
Slam it. girlfriends.

1004
00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:47.910
I used to slam it.

1005
00:54:55.123 --> 00:54:56.257
Fuck! No way.

1006
00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:57.858
that was fucking crazy!

1007
00:54:57.994 --> 00:54:59.654
Tangy.

1008
00:54:59.789 --> 00:55:01.496
Fuck!

1009
00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:05.731
Stan. uh. radioed. by the way.
on the. um. thingy

1010
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:09.196
that the boys are gonna be
back soon from fishing.

1011
00:55:09.332 --> 00:55:12.005
which means that I had
better...

1012
00:55:12.141 --> 00:55:13.307
Okay.

1013
00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:16.405
Goodbye. ladies.
Bye. Stace.

1014
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.774
Oh. yes!

1015
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.114
I'm going for the phones.
Keep a lookout.

1016
00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:20.380
- Okay. Wait. wait.
- Okay.

1017
00:55:20.516 --> 00:55:22.050
What do I do
when the boys come back?

1018
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:24.483
I don't know. Fucking yell...

1019
00:55:24.619 --> 00:55:26.651
"fat blunts"
as loud as you can.

1020
00:55:26.787 --> 00:55:28.416
Okay.
Don't forget to smile.

1021
00:55:28.551 --> 00:55:29.923
Fat blunts.

1022
00:55:30.058 --> 00:55:31.052
More shots?

1023
00:55:32.356 --> 00:55:33.857
Yeah.

1024
00:56:02.084 --> 00:56:03.491
Wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1025
00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:10.825
Fuck!

1026
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.500
Bad bitches for life.

1027
00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:14.134
Bad bitches for life.
Wait. No. wait.

1028
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.635
- Oh!
- You dropped it!

1029
00:56:17.835 --> 00:56:19.804
Oh. God!

1030
00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:24.809
Oh. fuck.

1031
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:26.712
Wait.

1032
00:56:27.147 --> 00:56:28.483
Sarah?

1033
00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:31.013
Dude. you... what happened
to your nose. man?

1034
00:56:35.718 --> 00:56:37.119
Hey. girls...

1035
00:56:37.254 --> 00:56:40.255
maybe we should
cool it on the shots.

1036
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:42.963
Just trust me. I think...
I think they're really strong.

1037
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.132
I'm. like.
really hardcore. so...

1038
00:56:46.268 --> 00:56:47.466
Just give it to me.

1039
00:56:47.602 --> 00:56:48.932
- No. Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Give it.

1040
00:56:49.068 --> 00:56:51.103
Come on. <i>mami.</i>
Just worry about yourself.

1041
00:56:51.238 --> 00:56:52.171
We got this.

1042
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.481
Oh. look. look. look.

1043
00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:09.357
Fuck!
- Oh. fuck!

1044
00:57:09.493 --> 00:57:11.592
What the fuck. babe?
It's just me!

1045
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:18.695
I'm sorry.

1046
00:57:18.831 --> 00:57:20.100
I just don't like
to be tickled.

1047
00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.529
Ooh. bro!

1048
00:57:21.664 --> 00:57:23.131
Fuck! Fuck!

1049
00:57:25.273 --> 00:57:26.475
Come on. Come on.

1050
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:33.580
When I was. like. four.
my sister. she pushed me.

1051
00:57:33.715 --> 00:57:35.278
Um. accidentally.
She's not a sociopath.

1052
00:57:35.413 --> 00:57:39.048
And my two front teeth just
shot right back up into their.

1053
00:57:39.717 --> 00:57:41.253
uh. the tooth holes.

1054
00:57:41.388 --> 00:57:42.689
It was disgusting.

1055
00:57:42.824 --> 00:57:45.226
But they were baby teeth.
so they grew back.

1056
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:46.358
Are you all right?

1057
00:57:46.494 --> 00:57:47.694
Sorry. how's your nose?

1058
00:57:51.365 --> 00:57:52.893
Where's Frida?

1059
00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:54.870
Uh. she's just freshening up.

1060
00:57:56.299 --> 00:57:58.972
All right.
I'll see y'all in a minute.

1061
00:57:59.107 --> 00:58:00.102
Wait!

1062
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:01.774
Hmm?

1063
00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:04.707
We're just gonna

1064
00:58:04.843 --> 00:58:07.549
smoke a... [loudly] fat blunt!

1065
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.078
Go off. queen!

1066
00:58:10.213 --> 00:58:13.621
Yep! We're gonna smoke
a big. fat blunt!

1067
00:58:18.258 --> 00:58:19.253
Okay.

1068
00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:21.391
Okay.

1069
00:58:21.527 --> 00:58:23.462
Let's fucking go!

1070
00:58:23.597 --> 00:58:25.127
Oh. I can't wait!

1071
00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.234
We've got ourselves

1072
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:37.205
a sticky situation.

1073
00:58:40.214 --> 00:58:41.517
Yeah.

1074
00:58:44.647 --> 00:58:45.851
Come on.

1075
00:58:46.715 --> 00:58:47.888
Fuck!

1076
00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:53.795
What's up. guys?

1077
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:54.926
Yo.

1078
00:58:57.393 --> 00:58:59.232
Does anyone
have a lighter?

1079
00:58:59.368 --> 00:59:00.767
Are you okay. babe?

1080
00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.103
Yeah.

1081
00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.431
Yeah. I'm just

1082
00:59:04.566 --> 00:59:08.170
really excited about this...
fat blunt.

1083
00:59:16.318 --> 00:59:17.652
Me too.

1084
00:59:22.688 --> 00:59:24.120
Fuck! Shit!

1085
01:01:09.559 --> 01:01:12.800
What are we
gonna do about you?

1086
01:01:13.499 --> 01:01:14.703
Hmm?

1087
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.203
What are we gonna do?

1088
01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:25.912
It's...

1089
01:01:27.547 --> 01:01:29.415
weird here.

1090
01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.484
Doesn't work here.

1091
01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:31.681
Stace...
Huh?

1092
01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:33.316
...is it weird here?

1093
01:01:33.452 --> 01:01:37.251
No. I. uh. I like it there.
I like it right there.

1094
01:01:37.387 --> 01:01:39.453
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Stan?

1095
01:01:41.093 --> 01:01:42.825
- It's a little weird.
- Right?

1096
01:01:44.295 --> 01:01:46.999
I concur.
Bitches be trippin'.

1097
01:01:47.134 --> 01:01:48.536
Does anyone
want any champagne?

1098
01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:49.634
But then. let's love 'em.

1099
01:01:49.769 --> 01:01:52.274
Wait. You didn't get any.

1100
01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:54.303
Go again. girl. Here.

1101
01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:56.910
Crazy times. man.

1102
01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.282
That's what I'm talking about.

1103
01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:07.789
It's comfy.
but it just... I don't know.

1104
01:02:09.454 --> 01:02:12.558
Is it too red? I feel like
it's a little too red.

1105
01:02:27.169 --> 01:02:28.710
You could help.

1106
01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.705
I'm fucking eating here.

1107
01:02:32.612 --> 01:02:34.141
Somebody's getting a dick
drawn on his forehead tonight.

1108
01:02:34.277 --> 01:02:35.717
What?
Nothing.

1109
01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.882
Stop moving. babe.

1110
01:02:38.017 --> 01:02:40.082
stop moving!

1111
01:02:40.217 --> 01:02:41.448
Are we doing this.
or what?

1112
01:02:41.584 --> 01:02:43.255
Damn it.
this is so fucked up!

1113
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.626
Shut up. She got bit.
She remembers everything.

1114
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.459
No. no.
- No. no. no!

1115
01:02:55.536 --> 01:02:56.968
Yeah. Okay.

1116
01:02:57.103 --> 01:02:59.736
Let's. uh.
let's get rid of it.

1117
01:02:59.872 --> 01:03:01.438
You want it? Stace?

1118
01:03:01.573 --> 01:03:03.371
Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.
How about
you take it?

1119
01:03:03.506 --> 01:03:05.847
Oh. I'm an idiot!
Stan. give me a hand.

1120
01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:09.179
I can't believe that
I didn't think of this before.

1121
01:03:09.315 --> 01:03:10.819
It was sitting right there
the entire time.

1122
01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.480
right in front of my face.

1123
01:03:14.523 --> 01:03:15.516
Okay.

1124
01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:22.094
Wait. Okay.

1125
01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:25.530
Now. why didn't we
just do here first?

1126
01:03:33.674 --> 01:03:35.107
Frida!

1127
01:03:36.207 --> 01:03:37.874
Hey. Frida!

1128
01:03:38.009 --> 01:03:39.610

1129
01:03:39.746 --> 01:03:41.181

1132
01:03:45.882 --> 01:03:47.086
Oh!

1133
01:03:47.653 --> 01:03:49.116
Yeah!

1134
01:03:49.252 --> 01:03:50.688
I'm just gonna...

1135
01:03:50.824 --> 01:03:52.193

1136
01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:53.324
Okay.

1137
01:03:54.394 --> 01:03:56.824
Hey. Sarah. where you goin'

1138
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.494
Here. smoke.
It'll look weird if you don't.

1139
01:03:59.929 --> 01:04:01.133
Okay.

1140
01:04:02.836 --> 01:04:05.599
So how did the phones go?

1141
01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:11.976
Bad.

1142
01:04:12.112 --> 01:04:13.544
It went very bad.

1143
01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:14.978
Okay.

1144
01:04:15.114 --> 01:04:16.849
Has your venom kicked in yet?

1145
01:04:16.984 --> 01:04:18.980
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:20.416
Heather and Camilla?

1147
01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:22.655
Those bitches are
a ticking fucking time bomb.

1148
01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:23.817
- Hey. buddies.
- Hi!

1149
01:04:23.953 --> 01:04:25.724
Hey.

We saw it.

1151
01:04:27.561 --> 01:04:28.321
What?

1152
01:04:28.457 --> 01:04:30.031
We saw what they did to Jess.

1153
01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.860
'Sup. stoners?
Hey!

1154
01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:35.465
We did?
Yeah.

1155
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.170
They killed her
'cause she wasn't forgetting.

1156
01:04:41.305 --> 01:04:43.208
This one is for you.

1157
01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:46.040
This one's for you.

1158
01:04:46.176 --> 01:04:48.147
I love you. bitches!

1159
01:04:53.215 --> 01:04:54.587
Hey!

1160
01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:57.824
There she is.

1161
01:04:57.959 --> 01:05:00.188
Hi... you.

1162
01:05:00.323 --> 01:05:02.359
- How are you?
- I...

1163
01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:04.526
missed you.

1164
01:05:04.661 --> 01:05:06.295
Aw. I missed you too.

1165
01:05:06.431 --> 01:05:07.633
You guys
get in any trouble?

1166
01:05:07.768 --> 01:05:09.569
No. no. no.

1167
01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:12.072
Just. um. girl time.

1168
01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:13.300

1173
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:23.116
- I'm good.

1176
01:05:31.089 --> 01:05:33.624
We keep pretending.

1177
01:05:33.759 --> 01:05:35.161
Okay.

1178
01:05:35.896 --> 01:05:38.230

01:08:57.664 --> 01:09:01.169
And I lead with so much
love...

1256
01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.202
But I'm quick to fuck

Yeah. it's been... Um...

1265
01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:30.964
It's been great. Yeah. Yeah.

1266
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.462
It's just always been

1267
01:09:32.598 --> 01:09:34.267
hard for me
to make girlfriends.

1268
01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.336
so it's been nice.
Hmm. Oh.

1269
01:09:37.599 --> 01:09:39.174

1270
01:09:39.807 --> 01:09:41.338
Yeah.

1271
01:09:41.474 --> 01:09:43.277

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.108
Yeah. babe.

1273
01:09:46.244 --> 01:09:47.446
Um...

1274
01:09:47.981 --> 01:09:49.184
Well...

1275
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.880
Women

1276
01:09:52.015 --> 01:09:54.053
have been taught to
compete against each other.

1277
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.849
Right?
Hmm.

1278
01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:57.989
When really
we should be helping...

1279
01:09:58.124 --> 01:10:00.657
I mean. supporting

1280
01:10:00.792 --> 01:10:03.329
each other. So. I don't know.

1281
01:10:03.464 --> 01:10:05.229
I've just
been thinking

1282
01:10:05.364 --> 01:10:08.763
that maybe when I get home.

1283
01:10:08.899 --> 01:10:10.034
that it would be nice
to start. like.

1284
01:10:10.169 --> 01:10:11.470
this program thing

1285
01:10:11.605 --> 01:10:13.737
where I. like.
teach women survival skills.

1286
01:10:13.873 --> 01:10:17.574
And I know that show was
stupid and totally degrading.

1287
01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:20.544
but I learned some
really useful shit.

1288
01:10:20.679 --> 01:10:22.042
And the truth is.
is that you never know

1289
01:10:22.177 --> 01:10:23.812
when you're gonna be stuck
in the middle of nowhere

1290
01:10:23.947 --> 01:10:26.050
in. like. a totally
terrifying situation

1291
01:10:26.186 --> 01:10:27.384
with no one to save you.

1292
01:10:27.519 --> 01:10:29.186
no one to even
hear you scream.

1293
01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:30.554
and you need to fight

1294
01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:31.622
for your fucking life!

1295
01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:40.730
'Cause it's scary...

1296
01:10:43.432 --> 01:10:44.635
out there.

1297
01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:55.481
Yeah.

1298
01:10:56.444 --> 01:10:57.377
It so is.

1299
01:10:58.981 --> 01:11:00.750
It is terrifying.

1300
01:11:01.584 --> 01:11:03.285
I just got so excited.

1301
01:11:03.421 --> 01:11:04.919
No. I do the same thing.

1302
01:11:09.262 --> 01:11:10.560

1306
01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:16.971
Is she okay?
- No.

1307
01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:18.801
You know what's great. though?

1308
01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.105
Just women.

1309
01:11:21.241 --> 01:11:22.538
when they band together.

1310
01:11:22.674 --> 01:11:24.576

1319
01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.644
No.

All right.

1321
01:12:06.915 --> 01:12:08.353

01:20:30.954 --> 01:20:32.088
Fuck!

1435
01:20:32.224 --> 01:20:34.189
Oh. my God!

1436
01:20:34.325 --> 01:20:35.794
They know. dude.
They know everything.

1437
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.127
We're gonna go to hell
for this.

1438
01:20:37.262 --> 01:20:38.258
What do you mean?
We're such nice guys.

1439
01:20:38.393 --> 01:20:40.234
- Drink this.
- Oh. my God!

1440
01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:41.735
You got perfumed. dude.
What does that mean?

1441
01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.167
That's why
you don't remember.

1442
01:20:43.302 --> 01:20:44.463
What does that mean?
Guys?

1443
01:20:44.599 --> 01:20:46.004
Will someone
please tell me

1444
01:20:46.139 --> 01:20:46.907
what the fuck's going on?

1445
01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:51.439
Guys?

1446
01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.443
Guys?

1447
01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:27.508
Red rabbit.

1448
01:21:31.446 --> 01:21:32.951
I don't understand.

1449
01:21:33.087 --> 01:21:34.383
I am not...
You go out there.

1450
01:21:34.518 --> 01:21:36.455
Okay. stop!
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1451
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:37.483
You can do this.

1452
01:21:37.618 --> 01:21:38.855
I don't like
this game anymore.

1453
01:21:38.991 --> 01:21:39.954
Hey. Come here. Come here.

1454
01:21:40.089 --> 01:21:41.256
Just go outside

1455
01:21:41.392 --> 01:21:43.326
- and go get the girls.
- All right.

1456
01:21:44.928 --> 01:21:45.893
Fuck.

1457
01:21:46.028 --> 01:21:47.231
It's okay.

1458
01:21:48.966 --> 01:21:50.168
You're just...

1459
01:21:51.803 --> 01:21:53.006
remembering.

1460
01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:57.109
But I... I didn't...

1461
01:21:58.773 --> 01:22:01.375
I didn't want to remember!

1462
01:22:01.511 --> 01:22:04.276
They're gonna do
what they're gonna do.

1463
01:22:04.412 --> 01:22:06.245
You child.

1464
01:22:06.381 --> 01:22:09.154
Forgetting is a gift. hon.

1465
01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.563
Help me. Help me.

1466
01:22:23.264 --> 01:22:24.664
Bitch. I tried.

1467
01:22:34.109 --> 01:22:35.312
Who's there?

1468
01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:38.249
It's just me. babe.

1469
01:22:43.757 --> 01:22:44.959
Here.

1470
01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:54.199
What did I do?

1471
01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:00.403
Nothing.

1472
01:23:01.171 --> 01:23:02.370
Thank God!

1473
01:23:02.506 --> 01:23:04.143
No. no. no.
I meant. you did...

1474
01:23:05.239 --> 01:23:06.442
you did nothing.

1475
01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.478
You did nothing for yourself.

1476
01:23:11.181 --> 01:23:12.745
You did nothing for them.

1477
01:23:17.693 --> 01:23:19.355
And. in my opinion.

1478
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:21.623
there's a real special place
in hell

1479
01:23:21.758 --> 01:23:25.032
reserved for people that
just choose to do nothing.

1480
01:23:28.664 --> 01:23:30.565
Why do you think
you chose to do nothing?

1481
01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.255
What the fuck?

1482
01:23:54.357 --> 01:23:55.388
This is impossible unless...

1483
01:23:55.524 --> 01:23:57.262
I've been here before.

1484
01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:06.766
What do we do?

1485
01:24:08.503 --> 01:24:10.407

1501
01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:46.243
Oh. is he gonna do something?

1502
01:24:46.379 --> 01:24:47.675
I don't know
what's happening.

1503
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.776
Everyone's fucking crazy
out here. Please help me!

1504
01:24:49.911 --> 01:24:51.213
Are you gonna do something.
nothing boy?

1505
01:24:51.348 --> 01:24:53.417
Slater. I'm scared!

1506
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.118
Don't open the door.

1507
01:24:56.254 --> 01:24:57.556
Don't open the door. Okay.

1508
01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.531
Shit!

1509
01:25:12.301 --> 01:25:13.705
I'm really sorry.

1510
01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:16.869
Look at you.

1511
01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.077
- Please!
- You're beautiful.

1512
01:25:20.212 --> 01:25:21.377
Come here. Come here. Stop.

1513
01:25:21.513 --> 01:25:23.744
Stop. stop.
It's okay. All right?

1514
01:25:26.151 --> 01:25:28.221
Hi.

1515
01:25:33.958 --> 01:25:34.991
Hi.

1516
01:25:41.331 --> 01:25:43.802
Yeah. It's good there.

1517
01:26:17.401 --> 01:26:19.173
I like your nails.

1518
01:26:21.406 --> 01:26:23.870
That's gonna scar.

1519
01:26:31.646 --> 01:26:32.813
You havin' a good time?

1520
01:26:35.286 --> 01:26:36.248
I'm having a great...

1521
01:26:38.957 --> 01:26:40.326
Hi.

1522
01:26:42.424 --> 01:26:43.923
Welcome back.

1523
01:26:47.264 --> 01:26:48.768
Fucking bitch.

1524
01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:50.804
Ah... Fuck him.

1525
01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.239
Don't worry about him.

1526
01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.969
He's just still mad
about the pinky thing.

1527
01:26:55.776 --> 01:26:56.703
Fuck!

1528
01:26:56.839 --> 01:26:58.374
I thought last year
was intense.

1529
01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:01.109
but you've really
outdone yourself.

1530
01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:07.749
So...

1531
01:27:09.352 --> 01:27:10.653
everybody's dead.

1532
01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:14.122
What now?

1533
01:27:14.257 --> 01:27:15.791
I'm just saying.

1534
01:27:15.926 --> 01:27:18.898
there is a version of this
where we're all just

1535
01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:20.630
still havin' a good time.

1536
01:27:21.732 --> 01:27:24.436
And sipping mimosas
and green juices.

1537
01:27:26.602 --> 01:27:27.971
And laughing at brunch.

1538
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.339
'Cause brunch.
brunch is real.

1539
01:27:31.475 --> 01:27:33.709
Brunch is so fucking real.

1540
01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:37.977
You want to know
what's not real?

1541
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:46.451
Forgiveness.

1542
01:27:46.587 --> 01:27:48.091
I'll show you.

1543
01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:51.423
I. Slater King. would like
to formally apologize

1544
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.827
for my behavior.

1545
01:27:53.496 --> 01:27:54.963
I've sought therapy.

1546
01:27:55.098 --> 01:27:56.600
and I'm gonna take a leave
of absence from my company

1547
01:27:56.735 --> 01:27:59.900
while I face these issues
head-on. I'm sorry.

1548
01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:04.905
I'm sorry.

1549
01:28:06.278 --> 01:28:07.875
I'm sorry.

1550
01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:12.319
I'm sorry. I'm...

1551
01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:15.949
I'm... I'm sorry.

1552
01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.424
I'm sorry.

1553
01:28:23.293 --> 01:28:24.694
I'm sorry.

1554
01:28:26.298 --> 01:28:27.932
I'm sorry!

1555
01:28:28.067 --> 01:28:29.395
I'm sorry!

1556
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:31.001
I'm sorry!

1557
01:28:31.136 --> 01:28:32.398
I'm sorry!

1558
01:28:32.533 --> 01:28:33.905
I'm sorry!

1559
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.236
I'm sorry!

1560
01:28:35.371 --> 01:28:36.677
I'm sorry!

1561
01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:37.777
I'm sorry!

1562
01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:38.910
I'm sorry!

1563
01:28:39.045 --> 01:28:40.010
I'm sorry!

1564
01:28:40.145 --> 01:28:41.176
I'm sorry!

1565
01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:42.243
I'm sorry!

1566
01:28:42.378 --> 01:28:43.409
I'm sorry!

1567
01:28:43.544 --> 01:28:45.011
I'm sorry!

1568
01:28:50.555 --> 01:28:51.754
So. we good?

1569
01:28:53.993 --> 01:28:54.988
No?

1570
01:28:56.228 --> 01:28:57.694
That's right.

1571
01:29:00.365 --> 01:29:04.338
There is no forgiveness.

1572
01:29:06.237 --> 01:29:08.038
There's just

1573
01:29:08.173 --> 01:29:09.975
forgetting.

1574
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:11.642
There's just forgetting.

1575
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:16.645
Which. by the way.
you are fucking incredible at.

1576
01:29:16.781 --> 01:29:19.149
You forgot about
the entire goddamn place.

1577
01:29:19.284 --> 01:29:20.218
That's amazing.

1578
01:29:20.353 --> 01:29:21.451
Imagine what humans could be

1579
01:29:21.587 --> 01:29:24.887
capable of if we could
free them

1580
01:29:25.022 --> 01:29:28.494
from the suffering
and the pain of their trauma.

1581
01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:31.798
Oh. my God. my sister.
my sister would be...

1582
01:29:31.934 --> 01:29:32.993
she'd be free.

1583
01:29:33.128 --> 01:29:34.927
She'd be free
'cause she's so fucked up.

1584
01:29:35.063 --> 01:29:36.668
because she remembers
everything.

1585
01:29:36.803 --> 01:29:39.098
She remembers every
single thing. She's. like...

1586
01:29:39.234 --> 01:29:41.574
"How could you go and
play tennis with that man

1587
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.469
after what he did to us
when we were little?"

1588
01:29:43.604 --> 01:29:45.579
And I'm. like...

1589
01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.408
I'm over here just.
like. "What did he do?"

1590
01:29:48.544 --> 01:29:50.016
"What did he do?"

1591
01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.810
"What the fuck did he do?"

1592
01:29:51.945 --> 01:29:53.684
"I don't know what he did."

1593
01:30:02.725 --> 01:30:04.327
This is gonna be great.

1594
01:30:06.765 --> 01:30:09.299
We can forget
all of this.

1595
01:30:09.434 --> 01:30:12.036
Come on. Me and you both.

1596
01:30:12.172 --> 01:30:13.506
Let's just...

1597
01:30:15.836 --> 01:30:17.774
Just a quick spritz.

1598
01:30:19.778 --> 01:30:21.440
What do you think?

1599
01:30:21.576 --> 01:30:22.779
Well...

1600
01:30:24.979 --> 01:30:26.479
I feel...

1601
01:30:28.453 --> 01:30:30.216
Fuck!

1602
01:30:30.351 --> 01:30:32.123
I feel like...
Okay. um...

1603
01:30:32.258 --> 01:30:34.054
Hold that thought.

1604
01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:36.562
I'm gonna be right back.

1605
01:30:37.697 --> 01:30:39.198
I want to hear
what you want to say.

1606
01:30:39.334 --> 01:30:40.532
I'm gonna be right back. okay?

1607
01:31:17.834 --> 01:31:19.099
Hey.

1608
01:31:19.568 --> 01:31:20.903
No! No!

1609
01:31:21.038 --> 01:31:22.673
No! Please. don't.
Please. don't.

1610
01:31:22.808 --> 01:31:24.542
Please. don't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1611

You're right.
There is no forgiveness.

1644
01:33:17.257 --> 01:33:18.350
Only forgetting.

1645
01:33:32.437 --> 01:33:33.640
Fucking...

1646
01:34:07.704 --> 01:34:09.104
I need a vacation.

1651
01:35:21.678 --> 01:35:23.347

Not here.
