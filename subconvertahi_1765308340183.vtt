You had a fully charged battery.
You didn't make a dent.

Get in.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.207
I told you. I explicitly told you.

42
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.210
I didn't want him going anywhere
that's not safe.

43
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:34.088
And not only did you take him.
you cut off all communication.

44
00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:37.467
Yes. I mean. in retrospect.
that was a bit inconsiderate.

45
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.593
Inconsiderate?

46
00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:40.178
We really should've left a note.

47
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.597
Is this funny to you?

48
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.015
Oh. Sorry. It must be my tone.

My mother says
I sound perpetually insincere.

50
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:50.146
Okay. this is my son's life
you're playing with.

51
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.564
My son.

52
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.443
So next time I say
I do not want him leaving my side.

53
00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:59.072
that means I don't want him
leaving my goddamn side.

54
00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.448
I'm right here. Mom.

55
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.368
You know. you can talk to me. right?

56
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:04.994
And I'm not a kid anymore.

57
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.121
Will. I am still your mother.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.332
-Doesn't mean you know what you're doing.
-What?

59
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.459
Your plan? It... It sucked.

60
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:12.710
I'm sorry. but it did.

61
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.629
You only liked it because it was safe.

62
00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.798
but we don't have time for safe.
not anymore.

63
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.885
We have to act. and we have to take risks.
and thank God we did.

64
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.136
Because my plan. it... it actually worked.

65
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.722
I spied on Vecna
and tapped back into the hive mind.

66
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.142
and we found out
that Holly was just the beginning.

67
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.768
Vecna is gonna take more kids.

68
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.812
I don't know why
or what he wants to do with them.

69
00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.274
but now we know something
we can use against him. his next target.

70
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.481
So next time you order me to stay
by your side. I wouldn't count on it.

71
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:43.992
But. as I said. in the future.
we will try to leave a note.

72
00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:49.205
We should go. We have to stop Vecna.
We don't have much time.

Yeah.

86
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.527
They are in the very best possible hands.
Holly. I assure you.

87
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:13.182
And I'm told that they are improving
with each hour that passes.

88
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.559
As soon as they're healed.
they'll join us here.

But you cannot offer them comfort
in Hawkins. Holly.

93
00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:28.218
The only comfort they have
is knowing you are here. safe.

94

might cheer you up a little.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.961
How did you know?

99
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.046
That they're my favorite?

100
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.673
Oh. it's. uh...

101
00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:46.716
It's just a hunch.

102

Your classmate. Derek.

Derek is coming here?

107
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:01.647
You don't like Derek very much. do you?

108
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.569
Should I just let the monsters eat him?

109
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.574
No. No. you can't... you can't do that.

110
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.077
Well. how about this?

111
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.454
I will tell Derek

112
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:20.166
that if he misbehaves.
or if he hurts you in any way.

113
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:24.378
I will send him right back.
and he can face those monsters on his own.

114
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.438

But in return.
I need you to promise me one thing.

121
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:48.278
Something very important.
Do you think you can do that?

122
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.362
Yeah.

123
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:55.701

go out into the woods. Do you understand?

126

But they won't find you.
That is. as long as you don't...

127
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:05.123
Don't try to find them.

128

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.857
Bike crash.
Flew headfirst into a light post.

180
00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:45.778
Look. I'm sorry about missing the crawl.
about everything.

181
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:47.988
It's not your fault.
Don't beat yourself up.

182
00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.782
Yeah. looks like he already did.

183
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:51.241
-Is that broken?
-I dunno.

184
00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:52.660
-Let me...
-Don't touch it. Why...

185
00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.704
-I wasn't... I wanted to...
-You were going to.

186
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.706
Hey. this isn't a social call. kiddos.
Let's go.

187
00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.254
[Steve] <i>Derek?</i>

188
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:05.381
<i>Derek Turnbow?</i>

189
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:09.051
As in the Turnbow family?
Like Turnbow Realty?

190
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.552
The one and only.

191
00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.554
Whole family's a menace.

192
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.014
[Nancy] How can you be sure?

193
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:16.225
Sure that Derek's the next target?

194
00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.394
Because I saw.

195
00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:22.022
<i>I've learned that
when I'm close enough to the hive mind.</i>

196
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.400
I can tap into it. into Vecna's mind.

197
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.443
<i>I can see who he's targeting.</i>

198
00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:30.030
<i>The first time it happened.
I saw through Holly's eyes</i>

199
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:31.865
<i>the same day she was taken.</i>

200
00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.661
<i>And this morning. it happened again.</i>

201
00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.332
<i>Only this time. I wasn't Holly.</i>

202
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.001
-[kid] What the hell?
<i>-I was someone else.</i>

203
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:44.837
-Watch where you're going. dipshit.
-[Derek] Suck a fat one!

204
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.880
I was Derek Turnbow. I'm positive.

205
00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.007
Hold on. I'm a little lost.

206
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.216
Shocking.

207
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:53.012
Were you seeing through the eyes
of... of Vecna or of Derek?

208
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:54.263
Both.

209
00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.973
I... I was Vecna.

210
00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:58.559
but inside Derek's mind.

211
00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.936
[Robin] Vecna's like
a psychic serial killer.

212
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.314
He stalks his victims.
but he does it by invading their minds.

213
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:06.650
That's what he did with Chrissy and Max.

214
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:09.368
Yeah. but the way
he's doing it this time is different.

215
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:13.407
We did some digging at the hospital.
It turns out that before he took Holly.

216
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.575
Vecna stalked her.

217
00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:18.454
But... he didn't appear as Vecna.
He appeared as Henry.

218
00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.039
As a friend.

219
00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.124
We think he was trying to earn her trust.

220
00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.251
Now. why he went to all that trouble.
we don't know.

221
00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:26.879
But I highly doubt
his long-term goal is friendship.

222
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:29.548
Whatever it is. whatever he's planning.

223
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.467
we have to stop him.

224
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.719
And we have to save Derek.

225
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.097
[Will] The Turnbows live here.

226
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.807
We wait in a van across the street.

227
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.642
As soon as they're asleep.
we move in. we grab Derek.

228
00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.270
and we take him to here.

229
00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:46.440
the McCorkle farm.
It's completely isolated. It's abandoned.

230
00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:51.361
The only thing is. we need to make sure
he doesn't see us or know where he is.

231
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:52.738
So we'll need to blindfold him.

232
00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:54.490
Wait. Hold on. What?

233
00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.950
So that Vecna can't find him.

234
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:59.745
Yeah. What. and Mom.
you're okay with just kidnapping a child?

235
00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:02.664
No. we're saving a child via kidnapping.

236
00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.249
And yeah. it's fine.

237
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:05.167
I think.

238
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.337
Yes. Now's not the time
to play it safe. Jonathan.

239
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.172
[Dustin] If I may.

240
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.551
though I'm not morally opposed
to any of this. there are a few holes.

241
00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.679
Yeah. Like what if Derek falls asleep
before the Demogorgon attacks him?

242
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:18.680
That's one.

243
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:22.935
Or what if Derek wakes up
before we grab him. alerts his family?

244
00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.021
-We'll go to jail.
-[Dustin] There's another.

245
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.981
But the third and most gaping hole is

246
00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.651
even if by some miracle
this plan even works.

247
00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:32.277
Holly's still missing.

248
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.947
Hop and El. still MIA.

249
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.199
This doesn't bring us any closer
to finding Vecna.

250
00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.827
This plan just buys us
and Derek some time.

251
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.786
That's it.

252
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.329
[Mike] Not necessarily.

253
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:43.622
There might be a way.

254
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:47.668
A way to save Derek and find Holly.

255
00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:52.548
This is Derek.

256
00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:56.885
And this is the rest
of the Turnbow family.

257
00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.681
We're gonna need to recruit someone
that the family trusts.

258
00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.813
someone that can gain access to the house.

259
00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:05.894
This person will knock the family out.

260
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.521
Then we'll extract the family.

261
00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:08.605
Knock them out?

262
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.441
Well. safely.
With sleeping pills or something.

263
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.444
I might know
where we could get some benzos.

264
00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:15.738
Those things could knock an elephant
on its ass.

265
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.490
[Mike] Perfect. That way if Vecna spies.

266
00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.783
he'll just assume
Derek is fast asleep in bed.

267
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:21.493
He'll send his Demos to grab him.

268
00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:24.997
Only he won't find Derek. He'll find us.

269
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:26.540
And we'll be ready.

270
00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:29.334
We'll get Murray to supply us
with the traps.

271
00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:32.213
We'll burn the sucker.
Send him scampering home to its master.

272
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.506
but not before we stick him
with one of these.

273
00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.427
We'll track the Demo
across the Upside Down

274
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.846
in the Squawk van
just like we did with Hopper.

275
00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:44.308
And if we're lucky.
the Demo will lead us back to its lair.

276
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:45.392
to Vecna.

277
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.186
to Holly.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.605

Yeah. no. I heard <i>what</i> you said.

I just don't know
why you're talking about it.

336

Maybe he knows what it is...

337
00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:12.419
or how to get through it.

338
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.703
That's highly doubtful.

339
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.830
What he will know. though.

340
00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.708
is the schedule
for the next supply convoy.

350
00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:48.862
Even if he knows something.

351
00:24:48.945 --> 00:24:51.281
he's been trained to resist interrogation.

352
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.159
The Russians took two weeks
trying to break me.

353
00:24:54.242 --> 00:24:55.785
and they still couldn't.

354
00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:58.538
We don't have two weeks.
We don't have two hours.

355
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:02.083
Convoy information.
I might be able to get out of him.

356
00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:05.378
Classified information?
That's not gonna happen.

357
00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.255
With my help. it will.

358
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.340
Oh. yeah. I'm sorry.

359
00:25:08.423 --> 00:25:11.468
I forgot about your extensive training
in interrogation tactics.

360
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:12.844
My battery's charged.

361
00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:14.513
I don't see how that helps us.

362
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:16.056
-I can break him.
-El...

363
00:25:16.139 --> 00:25:17.182
Twenty minutes.

364
00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:20.268
You get to ask him about the convoy.

365
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.853
You get what you want.

366
00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:23.772
then I get what I want.

367
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.486
Compromise. "C-O-M-promise." Remember?

368
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:30.737
Halfway happy.

369
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.240
-[banging]
-[lieutenant] Hey. what is this?

370
00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:36.618
Get me outta here!
Get me the hell outta here!

371
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.042
You're a stubborn punk-ass.
You know that. right?

372
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.792
{\an8}Einstein-Rosen bridges.

373
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:46.169
{\an8}more commonly known as wormholes.

374
00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:48.964
are often depicted
in an hourglass-like shape.

375
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.048
such as this.

376
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.010
While the existence of wormholes
is entirely theoretical.

377
00:25:54.094 --> 00:25:55.637
they have captured the fascination

378
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.015
of scientists
and science fiction writers alike.

379
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:00.976
Can anyone tell me why that is?

380
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.772
Come on. This is easy. Just...

381
00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.692
What's neat about wormholes?

382
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.027
[sighs]

383
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.071
Okay. Erica.

384
00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:14.739
Wormholes are neat

385
00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:18.493
because they allow matter to travel
between galaxies or dimensions

386
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.370
without crossing the space between.

387
00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:22.372
Yes. Exactly right.

388
00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.040
Again.

389
00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:28.878
And. uh. just think of all the places
mankind could go.

390
00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:30.630
Another galaxy.

391
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.424
-Another time. even.
-[mouthing]

392
00:26:32.507 --> 00:26:34.676
-So why aren't we doing it now?
-[mouthing]

393
00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:39.556
If wormholes did exist.
they would be extraordinarily unstable.

394
00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:43.268
Their enormous gravitational force
would rip them apart

395
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.313
at the very moment they formed. Now...

396
00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:55.405
You have 60 seconds to explain
why you interrupted my favorite class.

397
00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:57.907
Erica. this is really serious.

398
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.993
57. 56...

399
00:27:00.076 --> 00:27:02.454
It's hard
to explain everything in 56 seconds.

400
00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:05.957
But basically. everything went bad
at the crawl last night.

401
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.501
Wouldn't know. I wasn't invited.

402
00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.486
-That's why I'm ex...
-[Mike shushing]

403
00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:12.005
That's why I'm explaining.

404
00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:15.133
Things went bad at the crawl.
and a lot of stuff happened.

405
00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:17.719
and now we think
Tina's little brother's in trouble.

406
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.429
That literally makes no sense.

407
00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:22.932
And even if it did. why would I care
that Dipshit Derek is in trouble?

408
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:25.060
You're just gonna have to trust us. okay?

409
00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:28.855
And to help Derek. we're gonna need you
to get us into the Turnbow house.

410
00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:30.107
-Tonight.
-Not possible.

411
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.192
Of course it is.
Make plans to hang out with Tina.

412
00:27:32.275 --> 00:27:35.195
-Tina and I don't hang.
-You hang nonstop. She's your best friend.

413
00:27:35.278 --> 00:27:36.196
-Was.
-Was?

414
00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:37.531
-We are now enemies.
-Enemies?

415
00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:38.823
-Arch.
-Since when?

416
00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.617
Since PE class 12 days ago.

417
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.036
Then apologize for what happened
in PE class 12 days ago.

418
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:45.038
-No can do.
-Yes. can do.

419
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:49.459
All you have to do is use your mouth
to form a word that rhymes with "starry."

420
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:52.587
I'd rather learn about wormholes
than apologize to Tina

421
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:55.006
and help you all save Dipshit Derek.

422
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.050
-Sorry.
-[watch alarm beeping]

423
00:27:58.301 --> 00:27:59.302
Time's up.

424
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.890
This isn't about saving Derek.
It's about saving Holly.

425
00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:06.393
Vecna took her.

426
00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:10.730
And yeah. now he's after Dipshit Derek.
But we have a plan.

427
00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:13.983
A plan to both save Dipshit Derek
and find Holly.

428
00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:15.694
But the plan is...

429
00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.278
It's a bit insane.

430
00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.571
But after it's over.

431
00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:21.950
I don't think
Tina's gonna wanna talk to you ever again.

432
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:25.348
Well. why the hell
didn't you just start with that?

433
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:36.214
Hi. Doris.

434
00:28:36.297 --> 00:28:38.633
Oh! You here to see Mrs. Massey?

435
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.886
-You are just psychic. I'm telling you.
-I am. Thank you. baby.

436
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.055
-Thank you.
-Y'all go on back there.

437
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:46.891
Mm!

438
00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:48.101
Who's Mrs. Massey?

439
00:28:48.184 --> 00:28:50.312
My sweet granny
who fell down a flight of stairs

440
00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.522
and broke nearly every bone
in her frail old body.

441
00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:54.107
Oh God. I'm sorry.

442
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.234
Don't be too sorry.
She's not my real granny.

443
00:28:56.317 --> 00:28:58.028
I use her name so I can visit Vickie.

444
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:00.656
I know it sounds unethical.
but I always bring her cookies.

445
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:03.617
and I think Mrs. Massey loves me
more than her own family at this point.

446
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.162
More importantly. she has got. like.
a mondo stash of benzos.

447
00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.873
and her nurse is a slacker
who never locks the medicine cabinet.

448
00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:11.208
[nurse] ...this story I heard.

449
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.459
-Shit.
-Oh!

450
00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.295
-What... What are we doing?
-Hiding.

451
00:29:15.378 --> 00:29:17.380
-Hiding? Right. Why?
-Down.

452
00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:24.888
[Robin] Jesus. she talks so much.

453
00:29:24.971 --> 00:29:26.473
-I know. I'm a hypocrite.
-I...

454
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:27.640
We have to go!

455
00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:36.149
I promised Vickie
that I would take her to Enzo's tonight.

456
00:29:36.232 --> 00:29:38.151
and now I can't. obviously.

457
00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:39.778
meaning I have to ditch her again

458
00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:42.739
for reasons
that she just can't understand.

459
00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:46.201
A massive fight will ensue. and we'll
never make it to my fake granny's room.

460
00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.286
I can't be the reason
Wheeler's plan fails.

461
00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:50.538
-Okay?
-Okay.

462
00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:54.375
Shoot. Stay low.

463
00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.805
You know.
you could always just kiss her again.

464
00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:09.599
I knew that was your goddamn bowl cut.

465
00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:13.311
Yeah. I mean.
they're not that popular anymore.

466
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.440
Did I look like
I knew what I was doing at least?

467
00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:19.400
I mean. yeah. To me.

468
00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:22.153
I guess that's something.

469
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:25.323
So. how did you know
that. with Vickie. right?

470
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:27.909
How did you know that Vickie wanted to...

471
00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.161
-Make out?
-...to date?

472
00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:32.872
Oh. Well. we volunteered together.
You know. there were. like. signals.

473
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.123
Signals?

474
00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:38.044
Yeah. you know. like a brush of the knee.
a bump of the elbow. a shared look.

475
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:42.173
It all just kind of accrued.
like a snowball rolling down a hill.

476
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:43.299
until it was obvious.

477
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.426
How obvious?

478
00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:50.473
Let's say the. uh. snowball
became an avalanche.

479
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:52.725
[man wheezing]

480
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.735
Oh God. that looks awful.

481
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:03.736
[Robin] Sure does.

482
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.364
And he's in the same wing
as my fake granny.

483
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:08.867
-Meaning?
-Same slacker nurse.

484
00:31:11.494 --> 00:31:12.787
Jackpot.

485
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.623
Jesus. we could knock out half of Hawkins
with this shit.

486
00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.876
-Okay. load me up.
-Okay.

487
00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:29.179
[Murray] <i>Okay. so.
I couldn't get any ethanol.</i>

488
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:33.558
but I was able to scrounge up
a gallon of acetone.

489
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:34.475
Be very careful.

490
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:38.120
You smoke a Virginia Slim too close
to this stuff. it'll catch fire. okay?

491
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:41.482
Snare wire. various gauges.

492
00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:45.486
A creepy. child-sized CPR dummy.

493
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.572
Its purpose a mystery to me.

494
00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:52.577
Shotgun shells.
per our lovely lady's request.

495
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.248
{\an8}Three 20-packs of water balloons.
Purpose also a mystery.

496
00:31:57.332 --> 00:32:00.460
{\an8}But I did take the liberty
of selecting the grenade style

497
00:32:00.543 --> 00:32:03.087
{\an8}as it felt thematically appropriate.

498
00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:06.299
Do keep those far away from...

499
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.595
these 3.000 feet of barbed wire.

500
00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:12.764
[chuckles] Oh. I almost forgot.

501
00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:16.517
Some sparkling new spark plugs
for Bilbo Baggins.

502
00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:20.521
Spark plugs. that's it?

503
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.315
I'm also giving out free hugs.

504
00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:24.109
-You didn't get the turbocharger?
-No.

505
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.526
-The suspension kit?
-No.

506
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.112
-The aerodynamic spoiler?
-No.

507
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:29.280
It wasn't a goddamn Christmas list.
Murray.

508
00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:31.574
That's exactly what it was.

509
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:35.120
And the fact that Santa Murray scrounged
all this up in a single afternoon

510
00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:39.082
and smuggled it into what is likely
the most heavily secured location

511
00:32:39.165 --> 00:32:42.251
outside of the White House.
Fort Knox. and Area 51

512
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:44.462
is a goddamn Christmas miracle.

513
00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.839
So. count your blessings.

514
00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:49.092
hang some mistletoe. pucker up.

515
00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:51.844
and kiss my jolly ass!

516
00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:56.599
Thank you for the spark plugs.

517
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.529
-What are you doing?
-You gonna help or just stand there?

518
00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:11.907
I'd rather not herniate a disc

When I finally do get home. what do I do?

875
00:53:57.317 --> 00:54:04.157
I smoke cigarettes. drink cheap wine.
and watch <i>Cheers</i> reruns until I pass out.

876
00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:08.954
I didn't know you were missing
for eight hours.

it's not your fault.

But one thing I know for sure.

884

886
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:43.613
and I am not gonna look away.

887

Not again.
Not until this is over. and you're safe.

888

You don't have to look away. Mom.
I... I just... I need you to trust me.
