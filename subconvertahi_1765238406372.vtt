﻿1
00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.383
Uh. I was wondering if
you by any chance...

2
00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:09.801
Still had the offer?

3
00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.054
Maybe a fresh start
would be good.

4
00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.972
What about taking
our finger to a lab?

5
00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:15.099
Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.559
I mean. if it isn't Jay
Pflug's. whose is it?

7
00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.478
There's a secret room in the
building where your husband

8
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.979
ran an illegal poker game.

9
00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.941
I'm more interested in
what you're up to. Charles.

10
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.360
You hooked up with a suspect!

11
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.904
I can't find my phone. I might
have left it in the minivan.

12
00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.072
Or Sofia stole it.

13
00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.198
Oliver. get your car.
we're gonna intercept her.

14
00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.119
-Wait. you just missed our turn!
-No. no. this is a shortcut.

15
00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.995
-How do you know that?
-I grew up here.

16
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.413
What is she doing in Flatbush?

17
00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:42.042
I don't know. but maybe you could
shop for apartments while we're here.

18
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.546
All these invoices are
made out to "Tommy."

19
00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.924
Tommy the Tongue is not
a person. it's a company.

20
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.093
And that company is worth
a shit-ton of money.

21
00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.303
except that money was
withdrawn. all of it.

22
00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.472
-first thing this damn morning.
-By who?

23
00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.850
Who would want the money
that bad to kill those dudes?

24
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.018
Hide!

25
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.856
Their wives.

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.074
Do you want subtitles for any video?
-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-

27
00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.928
What makes a home?

28
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.976
Is it just four walls sheltering
the accumulation of a whole life?

29
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:54.031
Or is it the safe house
for all your memories?

30
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.034
The good...

31
00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.495
...and the bad.

32
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.384
After you leave
childhood behind.

33
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.762
the first home you
make for yourself

34
00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.598
becomes so much a
part of your identity

35
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.434
that on sleepless nights.
it forces you to wonder...

36
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.854
who are you without your home?

37
00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.325
And what would you
do if it were gone?

38
00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.519
Oh.

39
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.813
It's all gone.

40
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.649
Everything. everything.

41
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.401
-Everything.
-I know. baby.

42
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.736
I know. my love.

43
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.701
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

44
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.671
No. I was on set when
the call came in.

45
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.548
That's why I went
straight to the airport.

46
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.886
They said it was a short
in my electric tea kettle.

47
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.430
Oh.

48
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.516
-You know...
-Look. look. I...

49
00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.812
I want you to know one thing.
Not everything is gone.

50
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.523
I know. I have you. you have me.

51
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.859
That's really... That's
all that matters. I...

52
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.028
-Yeah.
-Wow. you really sold that.

53
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.156
No. but it's my dad's dog
tags from Omaha Beach.

54
00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:44.242
You know? And then I only had a
few little pictures of Dicky...

55
00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:46.161
of the baby before I
had to give him up.

56
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.789
and all my Playbills. and...

57
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.917
...just. you know. all
my stuff. It's my stuff.

58
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.168
Okay. come here.

59
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.419
Over here.

60
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.131
So now. you have new stuff!

61
00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.926
Our stuff. our wedding haul.

62
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.093
Oh. my God.

63
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.554
It's just not. you
know. the stuff.

64
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:08.725
it's just 47 years I
was in that apartment.

65
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.603
I just feel like
part of me is gone.

66
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.732
Well. now. part of you now
looks like a cabbage tureen.

67
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:22.197
Oliver. Only Murders in
the Building. season five:

68
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.990
-Widows' Peak.
-How good is that?

69
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.201
Because the widows have
piqued our suspicion.

70
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.661
Different spelling.
but we think it plays.

71
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.745
Yeah.

72
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.455
-Hi.
-Mm.

73
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.833
-Loretta. I'm so sorry.
-Oh.

74
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.126
You're a sweetie.

75
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.046
But you know. I didn't fly all
this way for doom and gloom.

76
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.715
Let's talk murder. Hi.

77
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.134
Uh. hi...

78
00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.886
Sofia Caccimelio.

79
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.974
seen handing a plaid
bag to Lester's widow

80
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.102
after a mysterious
bank account...

81
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.271
How do I make accounting sexy?

82
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.355
-Can I?
-Yeah.

83
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.439
Um...

84
00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:01.736
Two scorned women. black
widows. slain husbands.

85
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.821
Ooh.

86
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.407
-Swiss accounts.
-Oh!

87
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.117
Who said anything
about Swiss accounts?

88
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.619
Yeah. you want sexy?
She's serving sexy.

89
00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.455
Okay. we now have
two new suspects

90
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.833
that we can actually
podcast about.

91
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.627
Although. Charles
made out with Sofia.

92
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.504
who made off with his phone.

93
00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.007
Oh! She returned the phone.

94
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.967
She didn't call up. so she
doesn't wanna see me again.

95
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.051
Thank goodness!

96
00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.887
She's a murderous mob wife.

97
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.056
We hit it. we quit it. we over.

98
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.643
I've had the entrée. and
now I'm back to the apps.

99
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.186
the dating apps.

100
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.980
I was all over the apps

101
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.815
before I met you. Ollie.

102
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.443
Well. I... I also
dabbled. you know.

103
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.653
Last Gasp. Yeah.

104
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.989
Old-Gasm.

105
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.949
Silver Shrivel.

106
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.285
Help... I've fallen in love...

107
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.037
And I can't get it up.

108
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.836
Hey. guys?

109
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.630
Hey. guys. um. let's
focus on Rainey.

110
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.548
-Oh. yeah. Okay. sorry.
-Because where was she

111
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.383
the night of the murders?

112
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.511
And what did Sofia give
her in the plaid bag?

113
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.348
You know. Oliver. since
you're from Brooklyn...

114
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.767
Oh. sure. send the
Brooklynite to Brooklyn.

115
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.144
I thought you young people
were against profiling.

116
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.313
Anyway. Rainey hates me.

117
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.732
Hm. but she doesn't know me.

118
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.443
Or Emily Lawler.

119
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:27.072
Emily Lawler. the... the
detective I played on SVU.

120
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:30.742
-Oh. Uh. yes. yes. yes. yes. Right.
-Yeah. it was a small part. but I mean...

121
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.995
She had a great
chunky Cajun drawl.

122
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.956
you know. and she had
a great backstory.

123
00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.207
She. um...

124
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.418
...she fell down
a well as a child.

125
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.587
Her backstory was that
she was in a well?

126
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.632
She fell down a
well as a child.

127
00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.969
She was down a well three
days. just her and the 'gator.

128
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.804
I had a whole
monologue about it.

129
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.806
It was gonna be my
breakout. I thought.

130
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.976
But then. they cut it. and they
just pulled the whole episode.

131
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.394
and you know. who knows why.

132
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.479
-Is it too long? Maybe.
-Eh...

133
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.939
But what is long?

134
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.733
-I mean. if you...
-I think this

135
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.776
may be too long.

136
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.278
Okay. but I just wanted
to be Emily Lawler.

137
00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.198
because I've had a...
a really bad day.

138
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.950
and I don't wanna be me.

139
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.035
-I don't...
-Oh. babe. Baby. baby. baby.

140
00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.829
Let's... Let's go to Brooklyn.

141
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.747
You show me your hometown. 'kay?

142
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.582
-Okay. okay.
-Okay.

143
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.085
And do you still have the trench
coat from Death Rattle Dazzle?

144
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.754
Because I think
Emily would feel...

145
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.881
...buck naked without
her trench coat.

146
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.008
I love that we
can share clothes.

147
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.052
We can share.

148
00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.886
Quirky.

149
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.561
-I'm here for a finger.
-Charles!

150
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:40.770
Finally!

151
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.689
I hate having a body
part in my freezer.

152
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.483
I wake up for a midnight snack
and it's Haagen-Dazs. finger.

153
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.776
Haagen-Dazs. finger.

154
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.945
-Damn.
-I know.

155
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.906
Without the hand. it
looks kinda lonely.

156
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.451
No. I mean "damn." as
in. this is just ice.

157
00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.457
-What?
-Someone fingered your finger.

158
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.969
Well. there's no
signs of forced entry.

159
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.471
How's it look in there?

160
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.931
Anything outta place?
Anything missing?

161
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.477
Everything seems the same.

162
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.649
Oh. shit. y'all got the
big. nice ice cubes.

163
00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.027
I love the big. nice ice
cubes. make you feel rich.

164
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.488
Well. it's the little
things. I guess.

165
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.615
Wait a minute. What's that?

166
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.576
Maybe the finger thief left it?

167
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.869
Oh wait. no.

168
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.746
I might have. I'm
trying something new.

169
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.624
Uh. boots with rubber
soles. very cool.

170
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.793
Housekeeper must've overlooked
this. I'll take a photo.

171
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.670
She appreciates.
uh. visual feedback.

172
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.463
Don't we all?

173
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:52.258
Charles. when was the last time
you laid eyes on the finger?

174
00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.760
When we put it in the freezer.

175
00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:57.097
Great. so it could have been
stolen anytime in the last week.

176
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.848
Mm-hmm.

177
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.183
Oh.

178
00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.768
Last Gasp notification.

179
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.812
-I'm talking to someone very nice.
-Oh. yeah?

180
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.730
And what's her kinks. huh?

181
00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.149
Murdering? Dealing?
Hitting and running?

182
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.026
You know what? I deserve that.

183
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.904
But that's why I'm trying online dating
to meet someone good for a change.

184
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.531
And have you?

185
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.576
-Mm.
-Okay. you're being cute.

186
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.953
Let me see a pic.

187
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:21.955
Yep.

188
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.832
That's just a chin.

189
00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.041
Yeah. it's a chin.

190
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.292
Come on.

191
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.587
We're doing a little game where we
exchange body part photos very slowly.

192
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.131
and I kinda roll
it out. you know?

193
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.174
Holy!

194
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.509
Wow!

195
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.219
No.

196
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.929
No. you're not
wearing an earring.

197
00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:40.557
-Yes.
-No. you're not.

198
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.642
-Priscilla likes it. Yeah.
-I... I don't care what she says. you're...

199
00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.853
-Okay. I'm taking it off. there you...
-Okay. guys. Stop.

200
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.772
How can I get access to security
cameras in the building?

201
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.483
Howard's robot BFF.

202
00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.152
-They're in the lobby.
-There we go.

203
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.906
-Okay. let's test my...
-Okay.

204
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.117
-...Oliver lore.
-Yes.

205
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.618
-Flatbush.
-Yes.

206
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.580
-You lived here from nine to 12...
-Yeah. mm-hmm.

207
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.456
...with your second set
of foster parents...

208
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.624
-Right.
-...Sue and Al.

209
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.919
Sue had the six cats. Al had
the. uh. drinking problem.

210
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.255
-No. no. no. no. no. she had eight cats.
-Oh.

211
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.965
And he called it a
"drinking opportunity."

212
00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:17.010
Oh. what I'd give to see you

213
00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.138
-playing stick ball in a purple scarf...
-Yeah.

214
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.931
...with those little
preteen gams...

215
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.184
...just sliding right into home.

216
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.647
Can I play?

217
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.732
Ollie?

218
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.067
-Ice cream!
-Hurry up!

219
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.276
-Not it!
-Not it!

220
00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.334
I'd say I miss those gams.
but who are we kidding?

221
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.294
-I still got 'em.
-Oh. yeah.

222
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.671
It's true.

223
00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.346
Ooh. okay.

224
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:04.891
Rainey kills her husband and
instantly puts her place up for sale.

225
00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.726
That plaid bag is in there.

226
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:09.562
I feel it. I feel it.

227
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.148
And Emily Lawler's
instincts are never wrong.

228
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.327
So embarrassing. caught listening
to your own song. right?

229
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.204
Yeah. it's so cool.

230
00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.288

Thank you! I know. right?

237
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.802

Yeah. it's still on.

243
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.523
Wait.

244
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.608
Are you... Are you
guys on a case?

245
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.902
-Yeah. there was a break-in...
-No. No!

246
00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.904
I mean. no. there's nothing. No.

247
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.113
A break-in?

248
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.907
Wait. you're on the
14th floor. right?

249
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:03.992
I wonder.

250
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.827
Okay. so last night.
Gaga calls me.

251
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.079
And then after. I run
into Seth... Rogen...

252
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.790
and we end up back at my
penthouse doing shrooms.

253
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.918
And we're looking out the
window and we're just. like.

254
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.919
tripping on this little light

255
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:18.965
that keeps moving around the
14th floor on the East Tower.

256
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.759
You think there was
someone in my apartment?

257
00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.385
Or she was just hallucinating.

258
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.803
That is what Seth Rogen said.

259
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.097
-You could just call him Seth.
-No. I think it might be confusing.

260
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.308
'cause I'm also really good
friends with Seth Meyers.

261
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:29.726
-Oh.
-So. anyway.

262
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.145
Seth Rogen and I. we end
up going to an apartment.

263
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.522
and sure enough. there
is a little light

264
00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.232
moving under the door.

265
00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.360
Wait. hold up. do you remember
what the apartment was?

266
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:39.569
14C.

267
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.195
And I thought that the C.

268
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.948
it looked like a little
person wanting a hug.

269
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.951
But no one was
hugging it back.

270
00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.916
Oh my God. oh my God. THĒ!

271
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.640
I love you so much.
Can we take a picture?

272
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.338
Mora?

273
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.049
I'm gonna need you to talk to
her to get some more information.

274
00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.384
-Wh...
-Yeah. I clocked it.

275
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.887
Middle school besties.
did everything together.

276
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.514
until you had some nuclear-level
friendship blow-up.

277
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.933
Wow. You are a great detective.

278
00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.394
No. I was just a teenage girl.

279
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.355
But then I got titties.
and so did you.

280
00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:18.441
So. we grow up. we get over
it. and we move on. yeah?

281
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.366
-Hi.
-Hello there.

282
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.494
Feel free. the flyers are
there for your perusal.

283
00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.080
Why. thank you very much.

284
00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:34.749
Okay. Nice hat.

285
00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:36.334
Oh!

286
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.086
-Hello.
-Hello. welcome.

287
00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.420
-Thanks.
-Have a look.

288
00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:43.049
Oh. this is the exact layout
as the place I grew up in.

289
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.054
Oh. good. you... you
kept the original floors.

290
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:50.473
And the tuberculosis.

291
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.165
Hmm.

292
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.801
This room is off limits.

293
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:33.349
I'm so. so. so sorry to
scream out like that.

294
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.434
Um...

295
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.397
Uh. it's. um. PTSD
from the well.

296
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.275
but I... I won't... I won't
bore you with the whole story.

297
00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:46.112
Name's Emily Lawler. just up
here by way of Natchitoches.

298
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.656
Big change for a little
swamp girl like me.

299
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.994
I was headin' on. uh. up the
stairs and I heard "Vissi d'arte."

300
00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.579
You know Tosca?

301
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.038
Oh. do I!

302
00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:01.210
I played the Maria Callas part
in my senior year at Lafayette.

303
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:05.089
Is that Floria
Tosca's... dagger?

304
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.467
This is the same one
Maria Callas used

305
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.803
in her final performance
of Tosca at The Met.

306
00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.640
-Oh...
-Isn't it wonderful?

307
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:18.811
My husband came across it
at a police repo auction.

308
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.980
-Mm.
-On our 10th anniversary.

309
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.732
It was perfect!

310
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.027
He died this month.

311
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.111
Oh.

312
00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.238
My condolences.

313
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.699
I lost mine this past year.

314
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.077
In a fire. I lost everything.

315
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.829
-Oh.
-So...

316
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.790
Is this your lucky fella?

317
00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:42.376
No. no. no. I was his lucky gal.

318
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.671
And we were married for
30 years. and every night

319
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.840
he would come home and
kiss me on the head.

320
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.218
And then one night.
no kiss and...

321
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:53.971
he was gone.

322
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.891
Yeah. he fell into the fountain

323
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.435
of the courtyard
where we married.

324
00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.313
Hmm.

325
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.273
Look at that woodwork!

326
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.900
You don't see moldings
like that no more.

327
00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.152
-Oh. my God.
-Yeah. 100% pine.

328
00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:09.404
-Are you serious?
-On my mother...

329
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.364
-I would not lie to you. my friend.
-Ah!

330
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.157
Listen. uh.

331
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:17.245
not for nothing. uh.
what's your credit score?

332
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.081
Excuse me one sec.

333
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:22.416
I'll be right back.

334
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.502
-Pardon me.
-Jesus Christ.

335
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:34.053
There are the bags.
Ah. look at them.

336
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.807
Al. Sue. come on!

337
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.728
I'm asking you. please. The
play's not a waste of time.

338
00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.231
-I think you'll like it.
-Look enough of this.

339
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.150
We're not going to any
play. and neither are you.

340
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.236
We took him in. If
he's got any free time.

341
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.196
he can work at
the goddamn store.

342
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.865
Ah. don't be difficult now.

343
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:58.035
And it'll feel good for you
to contribute to this house.

344
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.454
-Aw.
-Al!

345
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.456
Not fair.

346
00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.548
-If I may.
-Hmm?

347
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.008
Why are you sellin'?

348
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.760
I would give anything
to at least have my home

349
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.637
and my... my stuff back.

350
00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.015
Yeah. I thought I'd feel
the same way. but...

351
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:23.352
you know. I look around.
and honestly. I...

352
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.772
I don't want any of this.

353
00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.107
I want him.

354
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.446
Yeah.

355
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.158
And. anyway. it's not like
I can afford to stay here.

356
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.951
I'm even selling the dagger.

357
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.622
My son thinks I can get
$500 for this on eBay.

358
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.290
-Yeah.
-Oh. Mm.

359
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.125
You wouldn't want
this. would you?

360
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.673
So. you didn't find the bag.
but you gave our suspect $500

361
00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.634
to keep a weapon?

362
00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.761
You didn't find a bag either.

363
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.180
Uh. side note. how
much cash do you carry?

364
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.474
Oh. you know I
don't trust banks.

365
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.517
Oh. and I do?!

366
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.269
Uh...

367
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.608
I don't care about my stuff.

368
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:14.070
I'm so glad you're in my life.

369
00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.743
And that woman...

370
00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.079
That woman didn't
kill her husband.

371
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.873
She's barely hanging on.

372
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:28.084
Loretta. look.

373
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.252
The daily meeting of
the Innocent Wives Club.

374
00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:33.422
And that's the mobster's wife.

375
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.049
-Oh!
-And that is a plaid bag

376
00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.384
full of money. I'm guessing.

377
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.763
She played me. She played
me like a fuckin' fiddle.

378
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.016
We're in pursuit. Putnam!

379
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.226
Oh! Uh. yeah. okay.

380
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.315
Howard. we need
Robot Lester's help.

381
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.025
He prefers "LESTR."

382
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.152
You can use "Human
Lester" for the dead one.

383
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:59.699
Oh. speaking of. I've styled new LESTR up
a bit more dashingly than the last one.

384
00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:01.867
So. what do you need?
LESTR can do anything.

385
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.036
Except cleanup spills. We're
still shy around water.

386
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.872
I got killed by
water yesterday.

387
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:09.917
Howard's gonna keep you dry.

388
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.585
You're safe with Howard.

389
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.463
-I don't feel safe at all.
-Howard. we need to see footage

390
00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.758
of Charles' front door
from last night around...

391
00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.301
What time were you
creeping around?

392
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.846
With Seth Rogen? Around 2:30.

393
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.597
Ooh. I'm so excited.
I did a clue.

394
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:24.932
LESTR. 2:30.

395
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.768
-You got that. babe?
-Gotcha. Daddy.

396
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.144
Is that grooming?

397
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.771
Now. at the academy they
prepared us for a lot of stuff.

398
00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.899
but I ain't never seen no
shit like this. I'm shook.

399
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.444
Okay. this is 1:00 to 3:00 a.m.

400
00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.070
-Let me know when to stop.
-Okay.

401
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.948
I was wearing my red feather cape.
couture. gifted by Donatella.

402
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.575
-Yeah?
-She raises. plucks.

403
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.618
and slaughters the birds.
humanely. of course.

404
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.829
So. just look for
plumes. I'll pop.

405
00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.541
Yeah. I don't
see any feathers.

406
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.626
Are you sure this
is the right time?

407
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.462
LESTR doesn't make mistakes.

408
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.756
Well. I think he did.
because I was there.

409
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.591
Were you. though? I mean.

410
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.553
maybe you were just telling a
story about your celebrity friend.

411
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.514
and pretend you saw
something that you didn't see

412
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.015
just because you have to make it

413
00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.767
-all about you.
-Mora!

414
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.561
Oh. Okay. yep. right
there. See. look.

415
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.230
Can you go back to it
again. but just go slower?

416
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.481
Here you go.

417
00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.696
-Was that...
-Humane fuckin' feathers.

418
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.491
Someone cut a chunk out of the
footage. They tampered with it.

419
00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.785
I'll bet that's when
they took the finger.

420
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.788
Which means...

421
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.165
Althea was telling the truth.

422
00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.708
Yep.

423
00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.669
Well. Charles and I are
gonna go to the precinct.

424
00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.629
because if the cops have
any footage of Lester

425
00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.923
falling into the
fountain. I wanna see it.

426
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.174
What about me?

427
00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:42.551
You need to go and
apologize to that girl.

428
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:49.433
Oh! Should we try
to get closer?

429
00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.268
No. no. no. I don't
want them to see us.

430
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:54.313
Also. the bod's starting to
tighten up. Did you pack a banana?

431
00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:57.233
Hey. how's it going today?
Do you care about dogs dying?

432
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.985
-Well. obviously. yes.
-Oh. my God. yes. of course.

433
00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:01.112
Well. I'm collecting signatures
to stop New York City

434
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.072
from opening its
first ever casino.

435
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.825
Right now. there's a few competing bids.
They're all just terrible for the city.

436
00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:07.368
-So. if you could just...
-Wait a minute. sorry.

437
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.745
What does that have
to do with dogs?

438
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.788
Oh. uh. nothing. I just
find it's a helpful way

439
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.373
to get people to stop.
you know what I'm saying?

440
00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.333
-Oh. my God. they're gone!
-Oh. geez. Ah!

441
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.918
-Uh. anyway...
-Saboteur!

442
00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:19.088
-Oh. God. where'd they go?
-We lost them.

443
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.841
Maybe we should head on up
to the corner and split up.

444
00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:22.925
Or no.

445
00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.595
No. we should go back to her house
and wait for them there. okay?

446
00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.013
Oliver. what are you doing?

447
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.890
I didn't think this
would still be here.

448
00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:31.058
What?

449
00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:36.147
Just for a minute. can
I show you something?

450
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.357
Okay. Ooh.

451
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.324
What?

452
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.745
-This is it.
-What?

453
00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:54.456
The theater that
made me love theater.

454
00:22:55.416 --> 00:22:58.586
Oh. Oh. man.

455
00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:01.922
Yeah. I can... I can see it.

456
00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:03.591
Little Ollie...

457
00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:07.052
owning the spotlight.

458
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.930
Well. it wasn't
exactly like that.

459
00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:11.515
No?

460
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.560
I was a... a quiet kid.

461
00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:17.771
-Yeah.
-No. it's true. I was.

462
00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:22.818
Bouncing from place to place.
you learn quiet is good.

463
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.278
Hmm.

464
00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:26.030
If you make yourself small...

465
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.367
maybe a family will let
you stay for a while.

466
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.494
So. I did. and it worked.

467
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.456
But I never...

468
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:37.958
felt at home.

469
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:44.131
Until one day... I
stumbled into here.

470
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:46.926
There were kids
putting on a show...

471
00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:51.931
...and they were big. and
loud. and unapologetic.

472
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:55.309
-And I... I wanted to be just like them.
-Yeah.

473
00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:56.769
They asked me to
be in their play.

474
00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:57.979
-Uh-huh?
-Bit part.

475
00:23:58.062 --> 00:24:00.481
but being on that
stage was the feeling

476
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:03.609
that I'd been searching
for my whole life.

477
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.486
-Mm.
-I rehearsed my little butt off.

478
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:07.571
hemmed my costume.

479
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:11.408
But when I worked up the
courage to invite Sue and Al...

480
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.870
they just...

481
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.416
I quit the play.

482
00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:28.884
But on the night of the
show. I couldn't stay away.

483
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:30.678
-Mm.
-I snuck out...

484
00:24:30.761 --> 00:24:32.554
...dressed in that costume.

485
00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.932
just in case they
still needed me.

486
00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:39.228
And I watched Pat
Rafferty say my line.

487
00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:46.902
In my whole life...

488
00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:53.617
I've only really felt
like myself in two places.

489
00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:58.247
I think... I think
being back here today.

490
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.293
I... I've... I finally
understand why I'm so afraid

491
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:05.087
-to leave the Arconia.
-Hmm.

492
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.757
I got an offer on my place.

493
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:10.009
It's big.

494
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.553
How big?

495
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.472
Late-career Brando big.

496
00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:17.599
-Oh. boy.
-Yeah.

497
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:20.853
A cushion. Would be nice.

498
00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:21.937
Yeah.

499
00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:25.691
Oh. what am I saying?

500
00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:28.152
But then again. uh...
You know. you...

501
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.196
What are we doing?

502
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.489
I just...

503
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.500
I want you to say your line.

504
00:25:43.584 --> 00:25:46.045
-My what?
-Ollie.

505
00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:48.505
You took this awful
life you were given

506
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:50.966
and you turned it into
something beautiful.

507
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:56.305
I refuse to let you think there's any
place on Earth you can't be happy.

508
00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.140
starting right here.

509
00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:00.142
-Okay?
-Alright.

510
00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.352
Okay.

511
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.565
But only if you do

512
00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:09.568
the never-performed Emily
Lawler monologue first.

513
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:12.196
-Oh. no. I'm not gonna... No.
-Yes. yes. yes.

514
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.906
Get up. come on.

515
00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:15.449
-I wanna see it.
-I... I can't possibly.

516
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:16.659
I haven't even...

517
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.119
Man. I haven't thought
about that in year...

518
00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:19.912
Mr. Thibideaux.

519
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:22.706
You must think that I'm
some damsel in distress.

520
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.584
Or maybe you think that
I'm still that little girl.

521
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:30.380
stuck down in Bob Turley's
borehole. beggin' for help.

522
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:35.719
But I'm not that
little girl anymore.

523
00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:37.679
Mr. Thibideaux.

524
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:44.770
One night. you gon'
be lying in your bed.

525
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:48.941
warm and safe. and
I'm gon' find you.

526
00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:52.528
And with Pa's gun delivered
straight down from heaven above.

527
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:56.281
I will put you in my sights
just like that 'gator.

528
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:02.496
I can't wait to
lower that gun...

529
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:05.290
and tell you...

530
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.001
No.

531
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:13.006
Y'all ain't even worth killin'.

532
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:20.180
Bravo!

533
00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:22.891
-Spectacular.
-Now. you!

534
00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:25.435
Okay.

535
00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:29.648
Hey. Fagin!

536
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.528
These sausages are moldy!

537
00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:40.325
-That... That was the line?
-That was it.

538
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:41.827
-Okay. That was it!
-That was it.

539
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.287
That was... That's
all there was.

540
00:27:55.966 --> 00:27:57.801
Well...

541
00:27:57.885 --> 00:28:00.095
if it ain't the
crybaby con-artist.

542
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:02.097
Thought you could
fool me. bitch?

543
00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:03.515
You can drop the accent.

544
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:05.309
Okay. drop this.

545
00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:07.019
We know about the
emptied accounts.

546
00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:10.564
We know about the bags of cash
passed between bloodthirsty broads.

547
00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:12.065
What the hell is going on here?

548
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:14.651
Did you follow me after
my date with Ch...

549
00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:18.113
-Where's Charles?
-Back off. Sofia! He's fragile.

550
00:28:18.197 --> 00:28:22.242
I think we were
both in a fragile.

551
00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:24.161
yet slightly horny...

552
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:26.455
Don't change the subject.

553
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:27.998
Fine.

554
00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:32.044
My husband ran a few
businesses in the Arconia.

555
00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:33.503
and Lester worked for him.

556
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:35.964
I was bringing
Rainey Lester's cut.

557
00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:38.050
-Yeah. money you killed your husbands for.
-Right.

558
00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:40.427
Wait. nobody killed my husband.

559
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.221
He died by accident.

560
00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:45.182
You think somebody
killed my husband?

561
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.228
Who the fuck killed my Lester?!

562
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:52.314
-Y-You did.
-Wrong! Give me names!

563
00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:55.275
-I'm scared now. I can't remember.
-There was a card game.

564
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:57.403
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-In the Arconia the night of our wedding.

565
00:28:57.486 --> 00:29:00.364
No. but he said he wouldn't
work for Nicky that night

566
00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:02.866
so he could go to your wedding.

567
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.744
Oh. my God. why wasn't I there?

568
00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:08.580
Oh. because I was here.
We... We had rehearsal.

569
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:10.916
Well. can anyone
corroborate that?

570
00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:13.335
Yeah. 23 tone-deaf kids.

571
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:14.753
They'll be here in a minute.

572
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:17.631
You know. I... I
teach musical theater.

573
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:19.258
I teach opera.

574
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:22.219
The money is to help
keep the lights on.

575
00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:23.929
-That's...
-So. do you have any idea

576
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:25.472
who could have
killed your husbands?

577
00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:26.848
Did they have any enemies?

578
00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:28.433
-No one!
-Everyone.

579
00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:33.146
Well. Lester didn't wanna tell
me much about what he did.

580
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.940
He didn't feel
good about the job.

581
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:37.734
but he was hoping to save
enough for our big dream:

582
00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:39.820
a place in the Arconia.

583
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:41.947
You know. it's where we met.

584
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.908
It's the last thing
he ever said. Look.

585
00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:47.546
-"It's beautiful."
-Yeah.

586
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:50.164
-It's...
-He got that right.

587
00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:53.125
Okay. you're off my list

588
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:55.335
because you made me feel things.

589
00:29:55.419 --> 00:29:57.671
You! Why are you here?

590
00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:00.591
No!

591
00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:03.552
Relax! It's one of
my dumb son's toys.

592
00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:05.387
-Oh.
-Rainey's borrowing it

593
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.930
for her production of Newsies.

594
00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:10.350
-Hi. kids!
-Hey!

595
00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.729
Newsies!

596
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.815
Oh. Can I help?

597
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:21.611
Thank you for
caring about Lester.

598
00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:25.449
And if this helps. uh. the
police found it on him.

599
00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:29.202
It's one of his bird whistles.
I've carried it ever since.

600
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:30.746
Oh. thank you.

601
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:33.582
Come on.

602
00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.376
Who's playing Cowboy Kelly?

603
00:30:46.428 --> 00:30:49.348
Althea? It's Mabel.

604
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.475
Look. I came to talk...

605
00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:52.559
Oh!

606
00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:54.227
What the hell?

607
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:58.565
My name is THĒ!

608
00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:00.984
Oh. Ow! Jesus Christ!

609
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:03.445
THĒ! Why are you
throwing shoes at me?

610
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.946
Oh. did it hurt your feelings?

611
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.366
-No. but it hurt my arm!
-Good. 'cause you know what?

612
00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:10.452
I'm a famous pop star now who
lives above you at the Arconia.

613
00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.496
So. I have about a
billion other free shoes

614
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:14.164
with very spiky heels!

615
00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.416
God. what is your problem?

616
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.752
Will you stop it? I'm
trying to apologize.

617
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:21.588
and you're acting
like a fucking baby!

618
00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:25.634
-Oh!
-I'm the fucking baby?

619
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.928
You're the one that embarrassed
me in front of my new neighbors.

620
00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:31.098
Well. you're the one that
made me afraid to be myself

621
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:33.850
and... be silly with girls.

622
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:35.727
Wait. what?

623
00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:41.441
Sunny and Cloudy.

624
00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:44.820
That thing we used to do

625
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.947
-before you changed.
-I changed?

626
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.492
Yeah. you dyed your hair pink and
made everyone call you "The". or...

627
00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.536
You know what? Only
after you ghosted me.

628
00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.121
I didn't ghost you.

629
00:31:54.204 --> 00:31:56.331
My friend died. I was depressed.

630
00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:59.084
Well. nobody told me that.
so I was depressed. too.

631
00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:00.419
I had to double my Lexapro.

632
00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:02.254
Oh. I doubled my Lexapro.

633
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:04.297
Honestly. thank God for Lexapro.

634
00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:05.924
Honestly. thank God.

635
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.599
I don't know if you
know this. but...

636
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.395
I wrote this song about you.

637
00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:21.231
Yeah. the artwork
kind of gives it away.

638
00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:23.775
The sun and cloud clued me in.

639
00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:26.445
But you're wrong.

640
00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.905
I never wished I was you.

641
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.367
I know that.

642
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.202
Because I wished I was you.

643
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.621
Oh. Mabel.

644
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.790
You ditched me for
your city friends.

645
00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:43.086
And every time I came to visit
you. you made me feel so lame.

646
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.173
And in my head. the
Arconia was. like.

647
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:48.592
the coolest. fanciest place.

648
00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:52.220
And that is why I
wanted to live here.

649
00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.014
You made it my dream.

650
00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:58.643
I'm... I'm sorry.

651
00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:01.855
I didn't mean to
make you feel lame.

652
00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:04.566
You're objectively not.

653
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.152
I mean. you're friends
with Seth Rogen.

654
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.570
And Seth Meyers.

655
00:33:12.282 --> 00:33:15.869
But you know. I really. really
could use an old friend.

656
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.997
You think we could start over?

657
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:23.960
Can I keep these shoes?

658
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:27.255
Are you still a size eight?

659
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:34.388
Oliver. we got the
courtyard security footage.

660
00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:36.389
This is it. Oliver.
Where's your laptop?

661
00:33:36.473 --> 00:33:37.891
Uh. in my office.

662
00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:41.520
Uh. young one. A word.

663
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.314
Uh... Ooh. I love your boots.

664
00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:45.815
Thanks. they're Althea's.

665
00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:47.651
Oh. did you drop a house on her?

666
00:33:47.734 --> 00:33:50.654
-Actually. the witches made up.
-Ah.

667
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:54.282
Well. speaking of houses...

668
00:33:55.325 --> 00:33:57.786
Oh. no. Are you really leaving?

669
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.205
I wanted to tell you first.

670
00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:03.917
Okay. I'm okay.

671
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.378
Are you... Are you going far?

672
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:07.837
Are you kidding?

673
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:10.549
Who is Oliver Putnam if he's
not on the Upper West Side?

674
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:13.051
-Ollie. can you come help me?
-Oh. uh...

675
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:15.762
-Oh. man.
-I gotta send my new roomie

676
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:17.722
back to the burn unit.

677
00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:24.771
What?

678
00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:27.399
Oh. sorry. it's just
Priscilla. she's so funny.

679
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:29.443
Look. Charles.
I'm happy for you.

680
00:34:29.526 --> 00:34:31.653
but if she starts
asking for money.

681
00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:34.030
or your mother's maiden name.
or childhood pet's name...

682
00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:35.532
...just let me know.

683
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:38.035
You don't have to worry about that.
She's just interested in my day.

684
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:40.329
When I told her about the break-in.
you should have seen her face.

685
00:34:40.412 --> 00:34:41.830
Well. actually. I
didn't even see her face

686
00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.165
'cause the Wi-Fi in
Portugal is so iffy.

687
00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:45.917
You told her about the case?

688
00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:49.588
Well. just a... a little tidbit.

689
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:51.715
I mean. she had a thousand
questions about our plan.

690
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.425
and the conversation
was slowing down.

691
00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:56.428
You know what. give me your fuckin'
phone. You're being catfished. Charles.

692
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.388
Okay. play the footage.

693
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.019
Oh. my God.

694
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:06.521
Wh... S-So he was alone?

695
00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:08.315
No. look.

696
00:35:08.398 --> 00:35:10.859
Oh. I knew it. I
fucking knew it.

697
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:14.446
Okay. so if you look right here.
this glitch is from the same footage

698
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:16.156
as THĒ and Seth Rogen's.

699
00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:17.949
Somebody has fucked
with this shit. too.

700
00:35:18.033 --> 00:35:19.451
Something has been cut out.

701
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:23.121
Um... why is the
Last Gasp peach logo

702
00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:25.749
the same as on the
security footage?

703
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.585
It's the same company.

704
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:32.005
So. who owns the company
that edited our footage

705
00:35:32.088 --> 00:35:34.549
and is pumping Charles
for info about our case?

706
00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:37.093
Hold on. I'm lookin'.

707
00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:41.973
What?

708
00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:44.017
So. do we look for
another two bedroom

709
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.061
so we can still use
all my furniture?

710
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:48.730
Mm. we could. we could.
Or we could start over.

711
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.233
I could do a Pinterest board. which
is kind of like a murder board.

712
00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:55.278
but for finding our
style as a couple.

713
00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:57.113
Alright. that would be great.

714
00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.450
It takes bravery to
build a new home.

715
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:03.203
and it's easier to be brave
when you're in the arms

716
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.581
of someone who
makes you feel safe.

717
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:09.751
But even for those
who do build anew.

718
00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:12.128
there remains a fear.

719
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:15.882
For they know that
danger is always lurking.

720
00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:19.094
and that no home
is safe forever.

721
00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.973
That's who's been messaging me?

722
00:36:24.057 --> 00:36:26.226
Yup. and cooked the footage.

723
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:28.144
And maybe killed Lester.

724
00:36:28.228 --> 00:36:31.106
What does it say?

725
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.733
You're such a smarty-pants.

726
00:36:33.817 --> 00:36:35.610
