<i>that everybody is dying
for you to answer.</i>

17
00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:11.548
<i>Where have you been

18
00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:15.583
<i>and made your CFO Vic Mahoney
CEO of King-Tech?</i>

19

<i>After everything
that happened.</i>

20
00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:18.851

21
00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.992
<i>that sometimes
you really do have to just</i>

22
00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:22.590

<i>So. uh. I sort of
bought an island.</i>

24
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.025
<i>An island?</i>

25
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:30.334
<i>No phones. no work.
We grow our own food.</i>

26
00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.970
<i>I wear the same thing
every day.</i>

27
00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:33.336

28
00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:35.166
<i>- Chickens?
- Yeah. I have chickens.</i>

29
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.775
<i>Seems like
you really are a changed man.</i>

30
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.874
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

31
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.447
<i>So. last year you started
the King-Tech Foundation.</i>

32
00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:46.077

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:54.892

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.474
Oh. Sorry.

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:18.077
The super's
gonna be here soon.

47
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.482
Right. About that...

48
00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:21.538
- Oh. what did you do?
- It's a surprise for you.

49
00:03:21.582 --> 00:03:23.288
- Oh. boy.
- I love you.

50
00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:25.455
Wait. Do we have any...

51
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.921
Thanks.

52
00:03:45.543 --> 00:03:47.339

- Hmm.
- You're late.

59
00:04:12.932 --> 00:04:14.304
Oh. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.271
I missed
the bus and...

61
00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:17.538
This is the King-Tech gala.

62
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.270
the most important event
of the year.

63
00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:20.983
Can we just have a quick talk
about your behavior last year?

64
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:22.640
- It was a little chatty. so...
- No.

65
00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:25.016
No. no. no. He talked to me.

66
00:04:25.152 --> 00:04:26.228
He told me he liked my nails.

67
00:04:26.252 --> 00:04:27.252
- That's it.
- Anyway...

68
00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:28.683
I just want. this time around.

69
00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.883
you to be a little bit
more invisible. okay?

70
00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:34.557
Okay.

71
00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:36.436
- Okay? Can you do that?
- Yes. I can do that.

72
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.855
- Okay.
- I can.

73
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:40.057
- And don't forget to smile.
- I won't.

74
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:44.402
I missed my audition

75
00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:45.675
waiting for the super
who never showed up.

76
00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.864
So we still have black mold

77
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.440
and I guess
we're just gonna die now.

78
00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.744
Yo. Jess.
can I get your lighter?

79
00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:51.642
Yes. But I want it back.

80
00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:53.688
I'm gonna have to write
my goddamn name on that thing.

81
00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:55.741
This haircut is so stupid.
Do I look like a boy?

82
00:04:55.877 --> 00:04:58.582
A very cute boy.

83
00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:01.419
I heard you sneaking out
last night at. like. 3:00 a.m.

84
00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:03.783
Where'd you go?

85
00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.389
- Heh.
- What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:08.052
- Don't be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

87
00:05:08.188 --> 00:05:10.890
I just can't magically
erase shit from my brain.

88
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.665
So. when you
get back together.

89
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.234
don't expect me to pretend
like I don't want to stab him.

90
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.202
- It's complicated.
- It's not.

91
00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:20.898
Stop giving away your power.

92
00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:22.314
You're not a human
phone charger.

93
00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.903
Just have some self-respect.

94
00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:28.914
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:29.674 --> 00:05:31.141
I love you.

96
00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:33.880
I just don't understand
why you keep going back.

97
00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:36.716
I guess I'm just scared
of being alone.

98
00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:40.418
Aw. You're not alone.
You have me.

99
00:05:40.553 --> 00:05:41.553
Mmm. Yeah.

100
00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:43.795
Don't forget to smile. ladies.

101
00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:46.862
<i>All right.</i>

102
00:05:46.997 --> 00:05:49.965
<i>Okay. Okay. okay.
let's get serious. people.</i>

103
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.834
<i>We want to thank you all
for being here with us tonight</i>

104
00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.967
<i>so that the King Foundation
can get on</i>

105
00:05:55.102 --> 00:05:57.074

- I'm so sorry.
<i>- ...Mr. Slater King.</i>

113
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.789
Careful.

114
00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:17.755
You're gonna sprain your neck.

115
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.563
I don't care if I break it.

116
00:06:22.062 --> 00:06:23.660
Ready
for your surprise?

117
00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:24.997
Oh. boy.

118
00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:30.503
- Red or blue?
- Uh...

119
00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:35.346
This is crazy.

120
00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:36.689
I know. right?

121
00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:38.021
No.
it's. like. crazy-crazy.

122
00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:39.511
We just can't really
afford to...

123
00:06:39.647 --> 00:06:41.151
Jess. don't do that.

124
00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:42.986
No. Whose time is it?

125
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:44.121
Our time.

126
00:06:44.183 --> 00:06:45.588
You know what my mom
used to say?

127
00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:49.556
- Hmm?
- Success is the best revenge.

128
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:50.890
You think he'll remember me?

129
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.441
Who could forget you?

130
00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:53.506
You know?

131
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.859
- Oh. shit!
- You okay?

132
00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:57.095
Sorry.
Yeah. I just.

133
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.742
I don't know how to walk
in these fucking things.

134
00:06:58.766 --> 00:06:59.809
Okay. do this thing my aunt

135
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:00.833
- taught me. okay?
- Okay.

136
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.307
East. west. east. west.

137
00:07:04.443 --> 00:07:07.071
East. west. east. west.

138
00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:09.811
- East. west. east. west.
- Hello.

139
00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:13.650
East. east. West. east.
west. east. west...

140
00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:15.585
Oh. shit.
It's Jennifer. Fuck.

141
00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:21.891
Oh. hold up.

142
00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:23.935
I think it's because
people like me would touch it.

143
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.032
So it's smarter
for them to do that.

144
00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:26.397
I wouldn't want to ruin it.

145
00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:27.894
Ladies.
this is a private area.

146
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:29.629
Could I have you step
that way. please?

147
00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:31.294
- Oh. okay.
- Yeah. sure.

148
00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:33.109
- Hey. Stan.
- Hey. Cody. how are you doin'?

149
00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:36.634
- Good.
- South. south. south.

150
00:07:40.813 --> 00:07:43.377
Hey. how much you think
that little head costs?

151
00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:45.748
Like. a million dollars?

152
00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:49.382
I wonder if that alarm would
go off if you stole...

153
00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:51.317
Frida. Frida.

154
00:07:51.452 --> 00:07:52.656
Frida?

155
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.997
Shit.

156
00:08:05.932 --> 00:08:07.165
Are you all right?

157
00:08:13.277 --> 00:08:14.374
Here. may I?

158
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.844
Yeah.

159
00:08:19.517 --> 00:08:20.849
Saw it in a movie once.

160
00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:22.592
and I've always
wanted to do it.

161
00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:23.819
Now you're even.

162
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.290
Slater.

163
00:08:27.087 --> 00:08:28.758
- Rich!
- Hey.

164
00:08:28.893 --> 00:08:30.199
the speech turned out great.

165
00:08:30.223 --> 00:08:31.783
Really? Are you sure?
I mean...

166
00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:33.067
How did it feel to be...

167
00:08:33.127 --> 00:08:34.376
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- ...just scared

168
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.530
- to say anything.
- Yes?

169
00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:36.931
I know. I know.

170
00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:38.439
- I totally understand.
- Your hand.

171
00:08:38.463 --> 00:08:39.983
I was very proud of you.
Listen.

172
00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:41.299
- you've come a long way.
- Oh.

173
00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:43.906
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.680
Listen. I'm...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

175
00:08:45.704 --> 00:08:47.904
No. no. You're not
interrupting. This is. um...

176
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:50.976
Uh. I actually
haven't asked your name.

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:53.244
Frida. I'm Frida.

178
00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:55.548

179
00:08:55.615 --> 00:08:57.587
Yeah.

180
00:08:57.723 --> 00:09:00.087
Uh. Frida.
this is Dr. Rich Stein.

181
00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:03.155
Um. he's...
He's actually my therapist.

182
00:09:04.189 --> 00:09:05.562
- Oh.
- He needs one.

183
00:09:05.698 --> 00:09:06.902
I'm just kidding.

184
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:07.926
Very nice to meet you.

185
00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:09.259
Blink twice if I'm in danger.

186
00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:10.914
- Oh. dear.
- Well. maybe not.

187
00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:12.296
Let's not answer
that one. right?

188
00:09:14.037 --> 00:09:15.110
Well.
I'll let you get back to it.

189
00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:16.285

213
00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.355

You got all that?
It's a bit of a whirlwind.

Do I know you from somewhere?

227
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.746
- Seen you somewhere? No?
- No. I don't think so.

228
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.335

240
00:11:14.553 --> 00:11:16.759
I forgot you own
your own island.

241
00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:18.763
It's casual.

242
00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:21.159
So casual. Yeah.

243
00:11:21.295 --> 00:11:22.932

- Can we go?
- I gotta go.

247
00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:30.378
I need to be in a place
where I can get

248
00:11:30.402 --> 00:11:31.941
- an umbrella in my drink.
- Yeah.

249

Did you see that?

252
00:11:44.054 --> 00:11:46.485
He was like...
to me.

253
00:11:47.992 --> 00:11:50.288
Another chapter

254
00:11:50.423 --> 00:11:52.289
- Yeah. totally.
- Did you get his number?

255
00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:53.745
Of course I fucking didn't.
How...

256
00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.096
What are you talking about?

257
00:11:55.231 --> 00:11:56.876
- How does a dude like that...?
- After all that?

258
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.107
I don't know.

259
00:11:58.131 --> 00:12:00.436

Okay.

337
00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:02.238
So do you think
the human sacrifice

338
00:17:02.373 --> 00:17:05.470

339
00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:07.771

You look so good.

342
00:17:15.553 --> 00:17:17.198
Is it weird that

00:17:17.222 --> 00:17:18.462
I don't know.
It's cute.

344
00:17:18.553 --> 00:17:19.660
How'd they know
our bra size?

345
00:17:19.684 --> 00:17:21.024
They're probably gonna

346
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.200
be dressed exactly
the same too.

I'm learning a lot.

355
00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:43.343
But eventually. I wanna do

356
00:17:43.478 --> 00:17:44.786
my own thing. you know?

357
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.250
I wanna be the Slater King
of crypto.

358
00:17:46.317 --> 00:17:47.112
Hey. Vic.
you want some watermelon?

359
00:17:47.248 --> 00:17:48.381
Thank you.

362
00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:54.023
What? What do you mean
it's a little chewy?

363
00:17:54.159 --> 00:17:55.399
Why do you always
gotta do that?

Two eyes.

367
00:18:07.939 --> 00:18:09.432
three little buttons.

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:11.170

00:18:36.062 --> 00:18:39.000
Oh. I knew it. You were
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes.</i>

378
00:18:39.135 --> 00:18:40.602
Eight seasons.

379
00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:43.537
Yo. you went cuckoo for
Cocoa Puffs on that show.

380
00:18:43.672 --> 00:18:45.539
Well.
they edit a lot of shit out.

381
00:18:47.378 --> 00:18:49.246

388
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440
Frida. you okay?

389
00:19:27.682 --> 00:19:29.249

Hmm.

Desideria.

394
00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:48.932
It actually only grows here.

395
00:19:49.067 --> 00:19:51.007
- Oh.
- We got a beautiful

396
00:19:51.143 --> 00:19:53.438
little herb garden over here.

397
00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:55.906
Got our chickens.

398
00:19:57.276 --> 00:19:59.282
You know.

399
00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:01.780
it's not what I thought
it was gonna be.

400
00:20:02.888 --> 00:20:03.946
What do you mean?

401
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:06.549
The legendary parties
of Slater King

402
00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:09.190
with drugs and debauchery.

403
00:20:09.326 --> 00:20:10.401
We still do drugs.

404
00:20:13.827 --> 00:20:15.129
We just do them
with intention.

405
00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:16.694
And we still have fun.

406
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.829
It's just a little
different now.

407
00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:21.364
Therapy changed my life.

408
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.100
Thanks. guys.

409
00:20:23.235 --> 00:20:26.541
Yeah. we have a bit of
a pest problem at the moment.

410
00:20:27.374 --> 00:20:28.471
It's a lash viper.

411
00:20:28.607 --> 00:20:31.047
I feel bad killing them.

412
00:20:31.183 --> 00:20:32.910
but they're kind of a problem.

413
00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:35.279
Are you in therapy?

414
00:20:35.414 --> 00:20:36.783
Oh. no. No.

415
00:20:36.918 --> 00:20:39.783
I think therapy is kind of
self-indulgent bullshit.

416
00:20:39.918 --> 00:20:41.787
You sound exactly
like my sister.

417
00:20:41.922 --> 00:20:43.762
Why should I pay to tell
someone about the time

418
00:20:43.793 --> 00:20:45.991
my mom tried to kill herself
in front of me?

419
00:20:46.293 --> 00:20:48.430
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:50.095
It's fine. I survived.
I'm still here.

421
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.434
Yeah.

422
00:20:52.804 --> 00:20:55.534
But I agree with you on
the whole talk therapy thing.

423
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.967
That's not really
what I'm into.

424
00:20:57.102 --> 00:20:59.904
Rich is more of. like.
a trauma therapist.

425
00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:03.479
Uh. you know. specializes
in repressed memory.

426
00:21:04.148 --> 00:21:06.481
What can't you remember?

427
00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:10.117
Uh. pretty much
anything before 10.

428
00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:11.914
So I imagine it was

429
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:14.586
probably pretty bad?

430
00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:16.827
Why would you
want to remember?

431
00:21:16.962 --> 00:21:18.329
I'd pay to forget.

432
00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:20.426
Maybe you're right.

433
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:22.231
Maybe forgetting is a gift.

434
00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:23.926
- Oh. God.
- Oh. shit.

435
00:21:24.062 --> 00:21:25.333
Don't even bother.
She's got it.

436
00:21:25.468 --> 00:21:26.575
- No. no.
- Let me help you.

437
00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:28.032
No. no. no. I got it.

438
00:21:28.168 --> 00:21:29.645
She's physically
incapable of accepting help.

439
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:32.068
Relax. you're on vacation.

440
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.805
Oh. Slater. uh.

441
00:21:34.941 --> 00:21:37.245
I had them put the chair
in the new spot.

442
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:38.609
- Okay.
- So let me know

443
00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:40.349
if it seems less weird there.

444
00:21:40.484 --> 00:21:42.151
- Okay.
- I think it looks nice.

445
00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:44.685
Uh. also. um. the vape liquid.

446
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.026
- I put in your desk.
- All right.

447
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.653
- And one more.
- Yeah?

448
00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:49.619
The new generator
is not working.

449
00:21:49.754 --> 00:21:51.054
So I had all the candles.

450
00:21:51.189 --> 00:21:52.735
uh. laid out in the...
in the dining room.

451
00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:53.759
- Okay.
- Okay?

452
00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:55.531
Appreciate you. I love you.

453
00:21:56.365 --> 00:21:58.435
I love you too.

454
00:22:01.473 --> 00:22:03.968
Oh. my God.

455
00:22:04.103 --> 00:22:08.109
I haven't
seen you in years.

456
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.980
It's been decades.

457
00:22:10.116 --> 00:22:11.281
Do you come here often?

458
00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:13.380
- Oh. all the time.
- Oh. of course.

459
00:22:13.515 --> 00:22:15.045
This is where I reside now.

460
00:22:15.987 --> 00:22:17.218
This is my home.

461
00:22:17.354 --> 00:22:19.182
East. west. east...

462
00:22:19.318 --> 00:22:22.559
Friends. tonight
we have zucchini blossoms.

463
00:22:22.695 --> 00:22:26.494
fresh from the organic garden
right here at Chez King.

464
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.624
We have a yuca
mofongo croquetas.

465
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.060
which is deep-fried. uh.

466
00:22:30.195 --> 00:22:31.932
which is a little bit
naughty.

467
00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:35.465
And. of course. we have this
beautifully dry-aged steak.

468
00:22:35.601 --> 00:22:37.003
Blessings. Enjoy.

469
00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:38.442
Oh. Wow.

470
00:22:38.577 --> 00:22:40.838
Everybody raise your glasses
for Camilla here.

471
00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:42.712
- No. don't do that.
- Yep.

472
00:22:42.848 --> 00:22:45.115
She just finalized the sale
of her app as of yesterday.

473
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.779
Welcome to King-Tech. girl.

474
00:22:46.914 --> 00:22:49.119
Thank you. Thanks. guys.

475
00:22:49.255 --> 00:22:50.553
What's it... How does it work?

476
00:22:50.688 --> 00:22:52.681
It's an astrology thing.
It's called The Cycle.

477
00:22:52.817 --> 00:22:54.084
Dude. it's awesome.

478
00:22:54.219 --> 00:22:56.426
You put in your birth time
and location.

479
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:57.935
- Mmm-hmm.
- And it tells you

480
00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.925
that the reason that
your sitcom got canceled

481
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.826
and your wife is sucking
the neighbor's dick

482
00:23:01.962 --> 00:23:03.893
while you're eating eggs
to slim down

483
00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:06.301
so that somebody
will fuck you...

484
00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:07.635
...is because

485
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.002
the planet Saturn
is trying to teach you

486
00:23:10.137 --> 00:23:12.938
how to process your emotions
in a healthier way.

487
00:23:14.743 --> 00:23:16.880
I'm glad
you're finding it helpful.

488
00:23:17.016 --> 00:23:18.016
It's awesome.

489
00:23:19.214 --> 00:23:20.484
Buddy.

490
00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:22.745
Ah. I just love cooking
for my friends.

491
00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:24.149
It just hits different.

492
00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:25.817
Looks beautiful. Cody.

493
00:23:25.953 --> 00:23:27.617
Yeah.
dig into the steak. guys.

494
00:23:27.753 --> 00:23:29.490
- Mmm.
- Dude.

495
00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:31.126
- Can I have some salt?
- Really?

496
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:33.222
Yeah. It needs it.

497
00:23:33.357 --> 00:23:35.037
- You want one?
- No. I don't eat red meat.

498
00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:38.030
- Oh. Sorry.
- This place is insane.

499
00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:39.543
- So pretty.
- Give me the pepper too.

500
00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:40.800
Fuck you. Vic.

501
00:23:40.936 --> 00:23:42.242
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

502
00:23:42.266 --> 00:23:44.536
I'm glad you're having
a good... Ooh.

503
00:23:44.672 --> 00:23:46.136
You got. like. a little...

504
00:23:48.442 --> 00:23:49.442
Uh-oh!

505
00:23:49.578 --> 00:23:50.941
Kool-Aid on the cult robe.

506
00:23:51.077 --> 00:23:52.979
- Oh.
- Oopsie-daisy.

507
00:23:53.114 --> 00:23:54.914
Don't worry about it.
It's fine. You're good.

508
00:23:59.892 --> 00:24:02.719
So. uh. Sarah. are...
are you gonna be on <i>All-Stars?</i>

509
00:24:02.854 --> 00:24:04.495
I was gonna be. yeah.

510
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.527
But. after 22 years.
they've just decided

511
00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:09.630
a show about girls in bikinis

512
00:24:09.766 --> 00:24:11.367
fighting for their lives
in the jungle

513
00:24:11.502 --> 00:24:12.742
is exploitative.

514
00:24:12.835 --> 00:24:14.443
- And I'm. like...
- Smell that. babe.

515
00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:15.703
Wow.

516
00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:19.242
Yeah. so two years
of training for nothing.

517
00:24:19.378 --> 00:24:20.575
I'm sure it'll come in handy.

518
00:24:24.847 --> 00:24:26.882
Oh. that's gonna
open up beautifully.

519
00:24:27.017 --> 00:24:29.850
So. uh. Frida. when you're
not staining your clothes.

520
00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:31.952
what else do you do?

521
00:24:32.088 --> 00:24:36.322
Um... Well.
I'm just... I'm just trying

522
00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:37.820
to figure it out.

523
00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:39.424
Figuring it out. huh?

524
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
Yeah.

525
00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:42.092
Let me know how that goes.

526
00:24:42.227 --> 00:24:43.798
Yeah. I guess
I just. you know.

527
00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:45.273
don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

528
00:24:45.297 --> 00:24:47.163
You know. Vic here
has a Harvard degree

529
00:24:47.298 --> 00:24:48.997
in not knowing
what the fuck he's doing.

530
00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:50.666
Ask him how he lost his pinky.

531
00:24:50.802 --> 00:24:52.170
Yeah.

532
00:24:52.305 --> 00:24:55.577
No. What's the big deal?
I'm just asking questions.

533
00:24:55.713 --> 00:24:57.447
I like our new friend
Frida here.

534
00:24:57.582 --> 00:24:59.012
I think she's cool
and interesting.

535
00:24:59.148 --> 00:25:00.459
I just want to get to know
her better. that's all.

536
00:25:00.483 --> 00:25:02.113
All right.

Weird.

What?

564
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:37.109
Nothing.

And it's very sharp.

572
00:26:57.762 --> 00:26:59.545
I just don't want you to cut
yourself. all right. dude?

573
00:26:59.569 --> 00:27:01.167

himself a birthday party.

There's something weird
going on here.

577

If by weird. you mean
that you're losing. again?

578
00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:35.031
Yeah. shit's getting
pretty fucking weird.

00:33:00.863 --> 00:33:01.957
Frida?

637
00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:03.462
Hi.

638
00:33:04.568 --> 00:33:05.662
Hey.

00:33:06.936 --> 00:33:09.101
I. um...

Thank you. That's sweet.

642
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.539
So...

- Oh. man.

00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:20.048
Oh. look who it is.

645
00:33:20.184 --> 00:33:22.448
- Frida. this is Rich.
- Hi.

646
00:33:22.983 --> 00:33:24.016
Rich. Frida.

Very nice to meet you.

648

I remember you.

649
00:33:28.121 --> 00:33:29.521
From the gala?

650
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.623
"Blink twice
if I'm in danger"?

651
00:33:34.798 --> 00:33:36.132
That's right.

652
00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:37.701
That's right.

653
00:33:38.803 --> 00:33:40.603
Amazing.

654
00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:41.763
Yeah. it's amazing.

655
00:33:41.899 --> 00:33:44.507
Hey. Stace?
It still feels weird here.

656
00:33:44.643 --> 00:33:45.643
Okay.

657
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.340
I think we should try it
someplace else.

658
00:33:47.475 --> 00:33:50.244
Why don't we just
light it on fire?

659
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.376
That might make it
a little less weird.

660
00:33:52.511 --> 00:33:53.842
- Don't do that.
- Hi.

661
00:33:53.978 --> 00:33:56.147
Don't... Don't do that.
You know it bums me out.

662
00:33:56.283 --> 00:33:58.455
- All right?
- Ah.

663
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.749
I'm sorry.

664
00:34:00.892 --> 00:34:02.091
All right. young man.

665
00:34:02.226 --> 00:34:04.257
I'm headed back
to the mountaintop.

666
00:34:04.392 --> 00:34:05.858
- Always enjoy our chats.
- Yes. sir.

667
00:34:05.994 --> 00:34:07.428
Thank you.

668
00:34:07.564 --> 00:34:11.067
- Oh. and thanks for the gift.
- I'll walk you out.

669
00:34:11.202 --> 00:34:12.762
Hey. hon.
do you have the light?

670
00:34:16.437 --> 00:34:18.471
Where's my knife?
Who has my knife?

671
00:34:19.744 --> 00:34:20.744
What?

672
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:22.431
My knife.
I can't find my special knife.

673
00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:24.471
Chill. You just
gotta ask somebody. man.

674
00:34:24.549 --> 00:34:25.274
You okay?

675
00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:26.743
Psst.

676
00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:29.051
Has anyone seen
Cody's special knife?

677
00:34:29.187 --> 00:34:30.813
I just don't know
where it went.

678
00:34:31.448 --> 00:34:32.982
You want this?

679
00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:35.167
No. thanks. Heather.
That weed makes me paranoid.

680
00:34:35.191 --> 00:34:37.193
Nobody has your stupid knife.

681
00:34:59.713 --> 00:35:01.811
Something horrible
is about to happen.

682
00:35:05.218 --> 00:35:06.420
What?

683
00:35:08.321 --> 00:35:10.160
When things are good.

684
00:35:11.262 --> 00:35:13.295
that's when
the bad stuff happens.

685
00:35:16.861 --> 00:35:18.432
Why would you
think that?

686
00:35:19.967 --> 00:35:21.171
Life.

687
00:35:25.942 --> 00:35:27.408
What day is it?

688
00:35:30.012 --> 00:35:31.379
I don't know.

689
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.480
When are we leaving?

690
00:35:35.479 --> 00:35:36.819
Whenever you want.

691
00:35:36.954 --> 00:35:38.287
That's not an answer.

692
00:35:39.716 --> 00:35:41.488
Are you having a good time?

693
00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:42.956
Yes.

694
00:35:45.157 --> 00:35:46.361

Who has got it this time. huh?

698
00:36:17.554 --> 00:36:19.691
- Not it.
- Oops.

699
00:36:21.431 --> 00:36:22.991
I don't even remember
taking it.

700
00:36:23.126 --> 00:36:26.062
- I know who took it.
- Eh. eh. oh. ah! Oh!

701
00:36:26.197 --> 00:36:28.430
What. do I gotta write my name
on this fucking thing?

Oh. shit.

00:36:40.184 --> 00:36:41.315
I got it.

708
00:36:41.451 --> 00:36:42.179
- Let's go!
- Yes!

709
00:36:44.053 --> 00:36:45.054
Love it!

kid. is "fucking awesome."

747
00:38:39.436 --> 00:38:40.798
What is it?
Is it poisonous?

748
00:38:40.933 --> 00:38:42.493
It's venomous.
but you're not gonna die.

749
00:38:42.572 --> 00:38:43.879
- Oh. my God!
- No. no. no.

750
00:38:43.903 --> 00:38:45.475
- Is it dead?
- Here. Here.

751
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.615
You're okay. You're fine.

752
00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:48.205
Oh. my god!

753
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.015
Should I. like. be going to.
like. a hospital or something?

754
00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:52.140
- You'll be fine.
- Besides...

755
00:38:54.078 --> 00:38:56.848
there are no hospitals.

756
00:39:00.786 --> 00:39:02.150
You want
some more water?

757
00:39:05.996 --> 00:39:07.423
How's your hand?

758
00:39:07.559 --> 00:39:08.959
I feel weird.

759
00:39:11.463 --> 00:39:12.693
I want my phone.

760
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:14.096
Okay.

761
00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:17.039
I wanna go home.

762
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:18.408
Okay. let's not go crazy.

763
00:39:18.543 --> 00:39:21.003
Everybody is. like.
smiling and laughing

764
00:39:21.138 --> 00:39:23.038
like 1960s fucking
flight attendants.

765
00:39:23.173 --> 00:39:24.811
Like. "Are you having
a good time?"

766
00:39:24.947 --> 00:39:26.907
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm having
a great time."

767
00:39:27.612 --> 00:39:30.750
I'm scared. Frida.

768
00:39:30.886 --> 00:39:32.558
I think
you just need some sleep.

769
00:39:32.582 --> 00:39:36.420
Don't. No. no. don't. don't.
don't do that. Don't do that.

770
00:39:38.724 --> 00:39:40.529
Can't you feel it?

771
00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:46.568
There's something wrong
with this place.

772
00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:51.006
What's wrong?

773
00:39:53.709 --> 00:39:56.006
What's wrong?
I seriously want to know.

774
00:39:56.808 --> 00:39:58.811
Is it the amazing food?

775
00:39:58.946 --> 00:40:01.250
Or the tsunami of champagne?

776
00:40:01.385 --> 00:40:03.581
Or is it
the 1.020-thread-count

777
00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:05.187
fucking sheets? What is it?

778
00:40:05.322 --> 00:40:06.885
You're not listening to me.

779
00:40:07.354 --> 00:40:08.557
Please.

780
00:40:09.323 --> 00:40:10.526
Please.

781
00:40:11.662 --> 00:40:14.497
For the first time
in my life. I'm here.

782
00:40:15.862 --> 00:40:17.064
And
I'm not invisible.

783
00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:18.732
So please.

784
00:40:19.465 --> 00:40:20.866
Please.

785
00:40:25.274 --> 00:40:26.476
I'm sorry.

786
00:40:29.376 --> 00:40:30.579
I'm sorry.

787
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.080
Yeah.

788
00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:33.681
Okay.

789
00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:40.617
I'm gonna go lay down.

790
00:42:31.398 --> 00:42:32.602
Hello?

791
00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:41.743
Oh.

792
00:42:43.678 --> 00:42:44.944
Hi.

793
00:42:46.245 --> 00:42:49.515
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just. um...

794
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:50.851
I was looking for Slater.

795
00:42:51.484 --> 00:42:52.688
Um...

796
00:42:53.717 --> 00:42:54.921
Hey.

797
00:42:56.326 --> 00:42:57.759
What's your name?

798
00:42:58.756 --> 00:43:00.129
Red rabbit.

799
00:43:00.264 --> 00:43:01.763
Red rabbit. right.

800
00:43:04.134 --> 00:43:05.134
Oh.

801
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.402
Oh. Don't worry. I won't tell.

802
00:43:09.537 --> 00:43:10.838
I'm not a narc.

803
00:43:13.275 --> 00:43:14.303
Sure.

804
00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:25.754
Oh. my God. what's in that?
That's crazy strong!

805
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:31.155
Red rabbit.

806
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:35.759
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

807
00:43:35.895 --> 00:43:39.001
Red rabbit. Red rabbit.

808
00:43:39.136 --> 00:43:40.136
Red...

809
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:48.504
What are you doing over here?

810
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.844
I. uh...

811
00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:53.513
I got lost.

812
00:43:53.648 --> 00:43:55.146
You wanna go that way.

813
00:43:57.083 --> 00:43:59.254
Oh. the chickens got out.
Again.

814
00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:00.888
Fucking nightmare.

815
00:44:08.731 --> 00:44:10.162
Come here. you little fucker.

816
00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:17.402
Wait. wait. wait.

817
00:44:19.102 --> 00:44:20.842
Why are we running?

818
00:44:32.516 --> 00:44:34.757
I don't know
why we do that.

819
00:44:37.393 --> 00:44:38.728
Hide this.

820
00:45:23.535 --> 00:45:25.973
All right. who did this?

821
00:45:27.806 --> 00:45:29.306
Seriously.

822
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:34.344
When did I cut bangs?

823
00:45:39.657 --> 00:45:41.821
What's up?

824
00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:43.555
You've got a dick
on your face.

825
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.192
Yep.

826
00:45:45.328 --> 00:45:47.656

00:45:53.434 --> 00:45:55.310
Oh. my God. Fuck. yeah.
There's blueberry muffins?

831
00:45:55.334 --> 00:45:56.966
It's
Slate's mom's recipe.

832
00:45:57.101 --> 00:45:59.337
Mmm. It's spectacular.

833
00:45:59.472 --> 00:46:01.392
- Thanks. bud.
- How'd you sleep?

834
00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:02.972
Amazing.

835
00:46:03.108 --> 00:46:04.346
All right. kids.

836
00:46:04.481 --> 00:46:06.145
Sails up.

837
00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:08.714
Who's ready to catch
some beautiful grouper?

838
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.279
Let's do it. Is it cool

839
00:46:10.415 --> 00:46:11.663
if I bring the muffins?

840
00:46:11.687 --> 00:46:12.787
Bring the muffins.

841
00:46:12.922 --> 00:46:14.720
Oh. how do we feel
about less loud?

842
00:46:14.856 --> 00:46:16.422
Sorry. babe.

843
00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:18.765
I don't think I can be on a
boat right now. to be honest.

844
00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:20.267
Come on. it'll be fun.

845
00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:22.424
- Big old bucket of worms.
- Oh.

846
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.164
Maybe we'll just have
some girl time.

847
00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:28.836
You guys go
be with the worms.

848

00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.854
Tom. is that

851
00:46:33.878 --> 00:46:34.952

852
00:46:34.976 --> 00:46:36.307

Oh. I needed this!

Thank you.

862
00:46:58.601 --> 00:47:00.060
Where's Jess?

863
00:47:00.196 --> 00:47:02.132
What do you mean?

864
00:47:02.268 --> 00:47:04.038
What do you mean.
"What do I mean?"

865
00:47:06.805 --> 00:47:08.141
Jess.

866
00:47:13.142 --> 00:47:15.049
Who is Jess?

867
00:47:20.852 --> 00:47:22.155
You okay?

868
00:47:24.527 --> 00:47:26.291
Is she okay?

869
00:47:27.724 --> 00:47:29.862
You don't look so good.
What's wrong?

870
00:47:29.998 --> 00:47:31.461
Yeah. what's wrong?

871
00:47:34.803 --> 00:47:36.301
Are you fucking with me?

872
00:47:38.336 --> 00:47:40.008
- Where's Jess?
- Huh? What. hon?

873
00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:41.813
My friend that was
in the room next to mine.

874
00:47:41.837 --> 00:47:44.474
Uh. the storage room?

875
00:47:45.709 --> 00:47:47.943
Hey. relax.
You're on vacation.

876
00:47:48.078 --> 00:47:49.380
Oh. Jesus.

877
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.628
Wake up!

878
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:10.330
Wake up!

879
00:48:10.466 --> 00:48:13.239
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

880
00:48:44.806 --> 00:48:46.271
Jess was here.

881
00:48:46.407 --> 00:48:47.942
- Jess was here!
- Hmm.

882
00:48:48.077 --> 00:48:49.603
And she said...
She said

883
00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:51.218
there was something wrong
with this place.

884
00:48:51.242 --> 00:48:52.443
I hear you.

885
00:48:54.383 --> 00:48:57.283
And I don't want to sound
like... like a bitch.

886
00:48:58.484 --> 00:49:01.587
It's just. like.
I feel like I would know

887
00:49:01.722 --> 00:49:04.654
if there was. like. this whole
other person here. you know?

888
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:07.159
I know
it doesn't make any sense.

889
00:49:07.294 --> 00:49:08.931
It doesn't make
any sense. but...

890
00:49:09.066 --> 00:49:10.373
I feel like...
I feel like

891
00:49:10.397 --> 00:49:12.529
we're forgetting.
like. a lot of stuff.

892
00:49:12.665 --> 00:49:16.599
How do we feel about
putting down the knife?

893
00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:19.739
Yeah?

894
00:49:20.841 --> 00:49:22.570
Yeah. I'm sorry.

895
00:49:22.706 --> 00:49:25.113
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

896
00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:27.849
It's okay.

897
00:49:27.947 --> 00:49:29.216
I'm sorry.

898
00:49:31.747 --> 00:49:33.187
What day is it?

899
00:49:34.183 --> 00:49:35.387
Huh?

900
00:49:37.157 --> 00:49:38.588
Do you know what day it is?

901
00:49:40.695 --> 00:49:41.695
No.

902
00:49:43.926 --> 00:49:46.299
But. like. I never know
what day it is.

903
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.570
Right.

904
00:49:50.006 --> 00:49:52.107
I'm having a great time here.

905
00:49:56.747 --> 00:49:58.179
But I also have this

906
00:49:59.112 --> 00:50:00.577
feeling that I'm. like...

907
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.548
not.

908
00:50:07.387 --> 00:50:08.955
- Does that make sense?
- Yes.

909
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.170
I have dirt under my nails.

910
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:11.687
and I don't know
how it got there.

911
00:50:12.822 --> 00:50:15.163
I'm sorry.
What is this?

912
00:50:16.062 --> 00:50:17.396
What is that?

913
00:50:17.532 --> 00:50:19.104
They were like...
"Oh. Sarah...

914
00:50:19.128 --> 00:50:21.497
you were climbing up a tree
and you were so wasted.

915
00:50:21.633 --> 00:50:23.068
you fell."
Uh-mmm.

916
00:50:23.203 --> 00:50:24.469
I didn't last eight seasons

917
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:26.808
on <i>Hot Survivor Babes</i>
because I fell.

918
00:50:26.944 --> 00:50:28.209
So you don't think I'm crazy?

919
00:50:28.344 --> 00:50:31.079
What's crazy is that
we got onto a plane

920
00:50:31.214 --> 00:50:33.442
with a bunch of dudes
we don't know.

921
00:50:33.577 --> 00:50:35.350
I thought
you all knew each other.

922
00:50:35.486 --> 00:50:36.486
No.

923
00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:42.684
Cody just chatted me up
at a coffee shop.

924
00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.191
just talking about
how he knew Slater King.

925
00:50:45.326 --> 00:50:47.191
But Heather and Camilla.

926
00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:48.493
they know everybody. right?

927
00:50:50.668 --> 00:50:51.793
I don't know.

928
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.338
Oh. my God!

929
00:51:01.474 --> 00:51:02.877
What the fuck
were we thinking?

930
00:51:03.013 --> 00:51:04.480
- Oh. fuck!
- I knew it!

931
00:51:04.615 --> 00:51:05.681
I knew it!

932
00:51:05.816 --> 00:51:06.816
I knew it! I knew it!

933
00:51:06.909 --> 00:51:08.347
I knew it was
too good to be true.

934
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:10.042
Of course they're fucking
with our heads

935
00:51:10.085 --> 00:51:11.484
because that's what they do.

936
00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:14.652
They distract us with
these cute little outfits.

937
00:51:14.788 --> 00:51:18.693
and they shower us with
raspberries and champagne.

938
00:51:18.828 --> 00:51:19.828
But you know what?

939
00:51:19.889 --> 00:51:21.896
We know
what's really going on.

940
00:51:22.032 --> 00:51:24.198
They are trying to control us.

941
00:51:24.333 --> 00:51:27.334
They're trying
to make us look crazy.

942
00:51:33.942 --> 00:51:35.144
And it's working.

943
00:51:40.148 --> 00:51:41.744
So they're making us forget.

944
00:51:42.718 --> 00:51:43.750
Yeah.

945
00:51:43.886 --> 00:51:44.912
Okay. but like...

946
00:51:45.853 --> 00:51:46.853
how?

947
00:51:51.896 --> 00:51:53.426
"Forgetting is a gift."

948
00:51:55.324 --> 00:51:56.527
Huh?

949
00:51:56.662 --> 00:51:59.762
Slater said.
"Forgetting is a gift."

950
00:52:00.736 --> 00:52:01.896
Oh...

951
00:52:05.171 --> 00:52:06.808
I don't get it.

952
00:52:16.414 --> 00:52:17.815
We need to call the cops.

953
00:52:17.951 --> 00:52:19.020
Yes.

954
00:52:19.156 --> 00:52:20.682
- We need to call the FBI.
- Yes.

955
00:52:20.818 --> 00:52:22.955
We need to call the cops
and the FBI.

956
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.090
Okay. but wait.

957
00:52:24.126 --> 00:52:26.228
- What?
- Wait. wait.

958
00:52:26.363 --> 00:52:27.871
Say we call the cops
and the FBI. right?

959
00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:28.989
Uh-huh...

960
00:52:29.124 --> 00:52:31.493
And we're. like.
"Hi. Hello. Please send help.

961
00:52:31.628 --> 00:52:32.748
"Slater King and his buddies

962
00:52:32.862 --> 00:52:34.797
are doing
horrible things to us."

963
00:52:34.932 --> 00:52:37.203
They're gonna be like.
"What did they do?"

964
00:52:37.338 --> 00:52:38.933
And we're gonna be like.
"Um...

965
00:52:39.843 --> 00:52:40.935
We don't know."

966
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.781
"'Cause they've been
secretly erasing memories

967
00:52:42.805 --> 00:52:44.805
with perfume. I guess."

968
00:52:44.941 --> 00:52:47.111
And the guys
would be like. "What?"

969
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:48.514
"We would never do that.

970
00:52:48.649 --> 00:52:49.989
other white guys
we probably play golf with."

971
00:52:50.013 --> 00:52:51.261
And Heather and Camilla
will be like.

972
00:52:51.285 --> 00:52:52.584
"Nothing but good times

973
00:52:52.719 --> 00:52:54.521
and fat fucking blunts
over here. officer."

974
00:52:54.656 --> 00:52:57.354
And I'll be like.
"Come on. guys. believe women."

975
00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:58.755
"Here is my friend's lighter."

976
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.539
And they'll be like.
"Sure thing. Of course."

977
00:53:00.563 --> 00:53:02.825
"You crazy fucking bitch."

978
00:53:04.428 --> 00:53:06.034
Okay. Okay. Okay.

979
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.333
- Look at me.
- Okay.

980
00:53:07.469 --> 00:53:08.708
- Let's get on the same page.
- Okay.

981
00:53:08.732 --> 00:53:10.267
Your friend. you remember her?

982
00:53:10.402 --> 00:53:11.638
Yes.

983
00:53:12.341 --> 00:53:14.606
- But I don't remember her.
- No.

984
00:53:15.939 --> 00:53:18.280
What's up with that?

985
00:53:21.249 --> 00:53:22.614
She got bit by a snake.

986
00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:26.321
Okay?

987
00:53:27.825 --> 00:53:28.983
And I drank this.

988
00:53:29.958 --> 00:53:31.423
What's in there?

989
00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:32.855
I'm pretty sure
it's snake venom.

990
00:53:34.289 --> 00:53:37.057
You think snake venom's
gonna make us remember?

991
00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:38.630
Yeah.

992
00:53:40.429 --> 00:53:41.633
Fuck it.

993
00:53:46.075 --> 00:53:47.639
- Yeah.
- Oh. God!

994
00:53:47.774 --> 00:53:50.409
- It's really bad.
- Oh. that's... That's venom?

995
00:53:50.545 --> 00:53:52.344
- Yeah. dude.
- Why didn't you warn me?

996
00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.142
- I did.
- That is disgusting.

997
00:53:54.278 --> 00:53:56.883
How are we gonna get Heather
and Camilla to drink that?

998
00:53:57.019 --> 00:53:58.815
Oh. man.

999
00:53:59.855 --> 00:54:00.855
Tequila?

1000
00:54:02.388 --> 00:54:04.825
Shots. bitches!

1001
00:54:14.899 --> 00:54:17.537
- Holy shit!
- What's in these?

1002
00:54:18.303 --> 00:54:19.473
Snake venom?

1003
00:54:28.282 --> 00:54:29.813
Slam it. girlfriends.

1004
00:54:31.449 --> 00:54:32.948
I used to slam it.

1005
00:54:40.161 --> 00:54:41.295
Fuck! No way.

1006
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:42.911
that was fucking crazy!

1007
00:54:43.032 --> 00:54:44.692
Tangy.

1008
00:54:44.827 --> 00:54:46.534
Fuck!

1009
00:54:46.669 --> 00:54:50.769
Stan. uh. radioed. by the way.
on the. um. thingy

1010
00:54:50.905 --> 00:54:54.234
that the boys are gonna be
back soon from fishing.

1011
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:57.043
which means that I had
better...

1012
00:54:57.179 --> 00:54:58.345
Okay.

1013
00:54:58.481 --> 00:55:01.443
- Goodbye. ladies.
- Bye. Stace.

1014
00:55:01.578 --> 00:55:02.812
Oh. yes!

1015
00:55:02.948 --> 00:55:04.263
I'm going for the phones.
Keep a lookout.

1016
00:55:04.287 --> 00:55:05.418
- Okay. Wait. wait.
- Okay.

1017
00:55:05.554 --> 00:55:07.088
What do I do
when the boys come back?

1018
00:55:07.224 --> 00:55:09.521
I don't know. Fucking yell...

1019
00:55:09.657 --> 00:55:11.689
"fat blunts"
as loud as you can.

1020
00:55:11.825 --> 00:55:13.454
- Okay.
- Don't forget to smile.

1021
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:14.961
Fat blunts.

1022
00:55:15.096 --> 00:55:16.096
More shots?

1023
00:55:17.394 --> 00:55:18.895
Yeah.

1024
00:55:47.122 --> 00:55:48.529
Wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1025
00:55:55.072 --> 00:55:55.863
Fuck!

1026
00:55:55.998 --> 00:55:57.538
Bad bitches for life.

1027
00:55:57.674 --> 00:55:59.284
- Bad bitches for life.
- Wait. No. wait.

1028
00:55:59.308 --> 00:56:00.673
- Oh!
- You dropped it!

1029
00:56:02.873 --> 00:56:04.842
Oh. God!

1030
00:56:08.852 --> 00:56:09.852
Oh. fuck.

1031
00:56:10.579 --> 00:56:11.750
Wait.

1032
00:56:12.185 --> 00:56:13.521
Sarah?

1033
00:56:13.657 --> 00:56:16.051
Dude. you... what happened
to your nose. man?

1034
00:56:20.756 --> 00:56:22.157
Hey. girls...

1035
00:56:22.292 --> 00:56:25.293
maybe we should
cool it on the shots.

1036
00:56:25.428 --> 00:56:28.001
Just trust me. I think...
I think they're really strong.

1037
00:56:29.198 --> 00:56:31.170
I'm. like.
really hardcore. so...

1038
00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:32.504
Just give it to me.

1039
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.970
- No. Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Give it.

1040
00:56:34.106 --> 00:56:36.141
Come on. <i>mami.</i>
Just worry about yourself.

1041
00:56:36.276 --> 00:56:37.276
We got this.

1042
00:56:42.618 --> 00:56:44.519
Oh. look. look. look.

1043
00:56:52.461 --> 00:56:54.395
- Fuck!
- Oh. fuck!

1044
00:56:54.531 --> 00:56:56.630
What the fuck. babe?
It's just me!

1045
00:57:02.668 --> 00:57:03.788
I'm sorry.

1046
00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:05.138
I just don't like
to be tickled.

1047
00:57:05.274 --> 00:57:06.567
Ooh. bro!

1048
00:57:06.702 --> 00:57:08.169
Fuck! Fuck!

1049
00:57:10.311 --> 00:57:11.513
Come on. Come on.

1050
00:57:15.147 --> 00:57:18.618
When I was. like. four.
my sister. she pushed me.

1051
00:57:18.753 --> 00:57:20.316
Um. accidentally.
She's not a sociopath.

1052
00:57:20.451 --> 00:57:24.086
And my two front teeth just
shot right back up into their.

1053
00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:26.291
uh. the tooth holes.

1054
00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:27.727
It was disgusting.

1055
00:57:27.862 --> 00:57:30.264
But they were baby teeth.
so they grew back.

1056
00:57:30.399 --> 00:57:31.508
Are you all right?

1057
00:57:31.532 --> 00:57:32.732
Sorry. how's your nose?

1058
00:57:36.403 --> 00:57:37.931
Where's Frida?

1059
00:57:38.067 --> 00:57:39.908
Uh. she's just freshening up.

1060
00:57:41.337 --> 00:57:44.010
All right.
I'll see y'all in a minute.

1061
00:57:44.145 --> 00:57:45.145
Wait!

1062
00:57:45.608 --> 00:57:46.812
Hmm?

1063
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.745
We're just gonna

1064
00:57:49.881 --> 00:57:52.587
smoke a... fat blunt!

1065
00:57:53.689 --> 00:57:55.116
Go off. queen!

1066
00:57:55.251 --> 00:57:58.659
Yep! We're gonna smoke
a big. fat blunt!

1067
00:58:03.296 --> 00:58:04.296
Okay.

1068
00:58:05.434 --> 00:58:06.434
Okay.

1069
00:58:06.565 --> 00:58:08.500
Let's fucking go!

1070
00:58:08.635 --> 00:58:10.165
Oh. I can't wait!

1071
00:58:17.513 --> 00:58:19.272
We've got ourselves

1072
00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:22.243
a sticky situation.

1073
00:58:25.252 --> 00:58:26.555
Yeah.

1074
00:58:29.685 --> 00:58:30.889
Come on.

1075
00:58:31.753 --> 00:58:32.926
Fuck!

1076
00:58:37.633 --> 00:58:38.873
What's up. guys?

1077
00:58:38.969 --> 00:58:39.969
Yo.

1078
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:44.270
Does anyone
have a lighter?

1079
00:58:44.406 --> 00:58:45.805
Are you okay. babe?

1080
00:58:47.043 --> 00:58:48.141
Yeah.

1081
00:58:48.277 --> 00:58:49.469
Yeah. I'm just

1082
00:58:49.604 --> 00:58:53.208
really excited about this...
fat blunt.

1083
00:59:01.356 --> 00:59:02.690
Me too.

1084
00:59:07.726 --> 00:59:09.158
Fuck! Shit!

1085
01:00:54.597 --> 01:00:57.838
What are we
gonna do about you?

1086
01:00:58.537 --> 01:00:59.741
Hmm?

1087
01:01:03.908 --> 01:01:05.241
What are we gonna do?

1088
01:01:09.747 --> 01:01:10.950
It's...

1089
01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.453
weird here.

1090
01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:15.588
Doesn't work here.

1091
01:01:15.657 --> 01:01:16.719
- Stace...
- Huh?

1092
01:01:16.855 --> 01:01:18.354
...is it weird here?

1093
01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:22.289
No. I. uh. I like it there.
I like it right there.

1094
01:01:22.425 --> 01:01:24.491
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Stan?

1095
01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:27.863
- It's a little weird.
- Right?

1096
01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:32.037
I concur.
Bitches be trippin'.

1097
01:01:32.172 --> 01:01:33.685
Does anyone
want any champagne?

1098
01:01:33.709 --> 01:01:34.783
But then. let's love 'em.

1099
01:01:34.807 --> 01:01:37.312
Wait. You didn't get any.

1100
01:01:37.447 --> 01:01:39.341
Go again. girl. Here.

1101
01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:41.948
Crazy times. man.

1102
01:01:47.657 --> 01:01:50.320
That's what I'm talking about.

1103
01:01:50.455 --> 01:01:52.827
It's comfy.
but it just... I don't know.

1104
01:01:54.492 --> 01:01:57.596
Is it too red? I feel like
it's a little too red.

1105
01:02:12.207 --> 01:02:13.748
You could help.

1106
01:02:13.884 --> 01:02:15.743
I'm fucking eating here.

1107
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.291
Somebody's getting a dick
drawn on his forehead tonight.

1108
01:02:19.315 --> 01:02:20.755
- What?
- Nothing.

1109
01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.920
Stop moving. babe.

1110
01:02:23.055 --> 01:02:25.120
stop moving!

1111
01:02:25.255 --> 01:02:26.535
Are we doing this.
or what?

1112
01:02:26.622 --> 01:02:28.293
Damn it.
this is so fucked up!

1113
01:02:28.428 --> 01:02:30.664
Shut up. She got bit.
She remembers everything.

1114
01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.497
- No. no.
- No. no. no!

1115
01:02:40.574 --> 01:02:42.006
Yeah. Okay.

1116
01:02:42.141 --> 01:02:44.774
Let's. uh.
let's get rid of it.

1117
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:46.476
You want it? Stace?

1118
01:02:46.611 --> 01:02:48.520
- Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.
- How about you take it?

1119
01:02:48.544 --> 01:02:50.885
Oh. I'm an idiot!
Stan. give me a hand.

1120
01:02:52.122 --> 01:02:54.217
I can't believe that
I didn't think of this before.

1121
01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:55.968
It was sitting right there
the entire time.

1122
01:02:55.992 --> 01:02:57.592
right in front of my face.

1123
01:02:59.561 --> 01:03:00.561
Okay.

1124
01:03:05.027 --> 01:03:07.132
Wait. Okay.

1125
01:03:08.466 --> 01:03:10.568
Now. why didn't we
just do here first?

1126
01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.145
Frida!

1127
01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:22.912
Hey. Frida!

1128

Oh!

01:03:32.691 --> 01:03:34.154
Yeah!

1134
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.726

1135
01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:37.231

It'll look weird if you don't.

1139

Okay.

01:03:47.874 --> 01:03:50.637
So how did the phones go?

1141
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.014
Bad.

1142
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:58.582
It went very bad.

1143
01:03:58.717 --> 01:04:00.016
Okay.

1144
01:04:00.152 --> 01:04:01.887
Has your venom kicked in yet?

1145
01:04:02.022 --> 01:04:04.018
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:05.454
Heather and Camilla?

1147
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:07.693
Those bitches are
a ticking fucking time bomb.

1148
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:08.855

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:13.359
What?

1152
01:04:13.495 --> 01:04:15.069
We saw what they did to Jess.

1153
01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:17.009
- 'Sup. stoners?
- Hey!

1154

- We did?
- Yeah.

1155
01:04:20.638 --> 01:04:23.208
They killed her
'cause she wasn't forgetting.

1156
01:04:26.343 --> 01:04:28.246
This one is for you.

1157
01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:31.078

I love you. bitches!

1159
01:04:38.253 --> 01:04:39.625

Hi... you.

1162
01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:47.397
- How are you?

1163
01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:49.564

1164
01:04:49.699 --> 01:04:51.445
Aw. I missed you too.

1165

You guys

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.607
No. no. no.

1253
01:08:39.433 --> 01:08:40.833
"Oh. word?
Say less. Send the addy."

1254
01:08:40.864 --> 01:08:42.678
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause I'm from Dyckman.

1255
01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:46.207
And I lead with so much
love...

1256
01:08:46.342 --> 01:08:48.240
But I'm quick to fuck

1257
01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.939

1261
01:09:00.249 --> 01:09:01.385

01:09:01.521 --> 01:09:02.733

1265
01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:16.002
It's been great. Yeah. Yeah.

1266
01:09:16.138 --> 01:09:17.500
It's just always been

1267
01:09:17.636 --> 01:09:19.305
hard for me
to make girlfriends.

1268
01:09:19.441 --> 01:09:21.374
- so it's been nice.
- Hmm. Oh.

1269

Yeah.

1271
01:09:26.512 --> 01:09:28.315

1272
01:09:29.851 --> 01:09:31.146
Yeah. babe.

1273
01:09:31.282 --> 01:09:32.484
Um...

1274
01:09:33.019 --> 01:09:34.222
Well...

1275
01:09:35.218 --> 01:09:36.918
Women

1276
01:09:37.053 --> 01:09:39.091
have been taught to
compete against each other.

1277
01:09:39.227 --> 01:09:40.887
- Right?
- Hmm.

1278
01:09:41.022 --> 01:09:43.027
When really
we should be helping...

1279
01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:45.695
I mean. supporting

1280
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.367
each other. So. I don't know.

1281
01:09:48.502 --> 01:09:50.267
I've just
been thinking

1282
01:09:50.402 --> 01:09:53.801
that maybe when I get home.

1283
01:09:53.937 --> 01:09:55.183
that it would be nice
to start. like.

1284
01:09:55.207 --> 01:09:56.508
this program thing

1285
01:09:56.643 --> 01:09:58.775
where I. like.
teach women survival skills.

1286
01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:02.612
And I know that show was
stupid and totally degrading.

1287
01:10:02.748 --> 01:10:05.582
but I learned some
really useful shit.

1288
01:10:05.717 --> 01:10:07.191
And the truth is.
is that you never know

1289
01:10:07.215 --> 01:10:08.961
when you're gonna be stuck
in the middle of nowhere

1290
01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:11.088
in. like. a totally
terrifying situation

1291
01:10:11.224 --> 01:10:12.422
with no one to save you.

1292
01:10:12.557 --> 01:10:14.224
no one to even
hear you scream.

1293
01:10:14.359 --> 01:10:15.592
and you need to fight

1294
01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:17.288
for your fucking life!

1295
01:10:24.072 --> 01:10:25.768
'Cause it's scary...

1296
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:29.673
out there.

1297
01:10:39.317 --> 01:10:40.519
Yeah.

1298
01:10:41.482 --> 01:10:42.482
It so is.

1299
01:10:44.019 --> 01:10:45.788
It is terrifying.

1300
01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:48.323
I just got so excited.

1301
01:10:48.459 --> 01:10:49.957
No. I do the same thing.

1302
01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.598
Yeah. it really is.

1303
01:10:55.734 --> 01:10:57.174
You know.
my cousin's wife got mugged

1304
01:10:57.205 --> 01:10:58.598

1305
01:10:58.734 --> 01:11:00.140
- Oh. my God!
- You see?

1306
01:11:00.275 --> 01:11:02.009
- Is she okay?
- No.

1307
01:11:02.145 --> 01:11:03.839
You know what's great. though?

1308
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.143
Just women.

1309
01:11:06.279 --> 01:11:07.576
when they band together.

1310
01:11:07.712 --> 01:11:09.614

1311
01:11:13.286 --> 01:11:14.883

1319
01:11:43.478 --> 01:11:44.682
No.

1320
01:11:50.156 --> 01:11:51.251
All right.

1321
01:11:51.953 --> 01:11:53.391

01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:05.112
Lock the fucking door!

1431
01:20:07.388 --> 01:20:08.519
Guys?

1432
01:20:10.685 --> 01:20:13.388
Guys. we need the hospital.

1433
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:15.856
Oh. fuck. I need a hospital.

1434
01:20:15.992 --> 01:20:17.126
Fuck!

1435
01:20:17.262 --> 01:20:19.227
Oh. my God!

1436
01:20:19.363 --> 01:20:20.843
They know. dude.
They know everything.

1437
01:20:20.968 --> 01:20:22.208
We're gonna go to hell
for this.

1438
01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:23.407
What do you mean?
We're such nice guys.

1439
01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:25.272
- Drink this.
- Oh. my God!

1440
01:20:25.407 --> 01:20:26.885
- You got perfumed. dude.
- What does that mean?

1441
01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:28.316
That's why
you don't remember.

1442
01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.613
- What does that mean?
- Guys?

1443
01:20:29.637 --> 01:20:31.042
Will someone
please tell me

1444
01:20:31.177 --> 01:20:32.422
what the fuck's going on?

1445
01:20:35.483 --> 01:20:36.483
Guys?

1446
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.481
Guys?

1447
01:21:11.552 --> 01:21:12.552
Red rabbit.

1448
01:21:16.484 --> 01:21:17.989
I don't understand.

1449
01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.525
I am not...
You go out there.

1450
01:21:19.556 --> 01:21:21.493
Okay. stop!
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1451
01:21:21.628 --> 01:21:22.628
You can do this.

1452
01:21:22.656 --> 01:21:23.893
I don't like
this game anymore.

1453
01:21:24.029 --> 01:21:25.069
Hey. Come here. Come here.

1454
01:21:25.127 --> 01:21:26.294
Just go outside

1455
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:28.364
- and go get the girls.
- All right.

1456
01:21:29.966 --> 01:21:30.966
Fuck.

1457
01:21:31.066 --> 01:21:32.269
It's okay.

1458
01:21:34.004 --> 01:21:35.206
You're just...

1459
01:21:36.841 --> 01:21:38.044
remembering.

1460
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.147
But I... I didn't...

1461
01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:46.413
I didn't want to remember!

1462
01:21:46.549 --> 01:21:49.314
They're gonna do
what they're gonna do.

1463
01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:51.283
You child.

1464
01:21:51.419 --> 01:21:54.192
Forgetting is a gift. hon.

1465
01:22:05.607 --> 01:22:07.601
Help me. Help me.

1466
01:22:08.302 --> 01:22:09.702
Bitch. I tried.

1467
01:22:19.147 --> 01:22:20.350
Who's there?

1468
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:23.287
It's just me. babe.

1469
01:22:28.795 --> 01:22:29.997
Here.

1470
01:22:37.639 --> 01:22:39.237
What did I do?

1471
01:22:44.413 --> 01:22:45.441
Nothing.

1472
01:22:46.209 --> 01:22:47.408
Thank God!

1473
01:22:47.544 --> 01:22:49.181
No. no. no.
I meant. you did...

1474
01:22:50.277 --> 01:22:51.480
you did nothing.

1475
01:22:52.855 --> 01:22:54.516
You did nothing for yourself.

1476
01:22:56.219 --> 01:22:57.783
You did nothing for them.

1477
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.393
And. in my opinion.

1478
01:23:04.528 --> 01:23:06.661
there's a real special place
in hell

1479
01:23:06.796 --> 01:23:10.070
reserved for people that
just choose to do nothing.

1480
01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:15.603
Why do you think
you chose to do nothing?

1481
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:35.293
What the fuck?

1482
01:23:39.395 --> 01:23:40.515
This is impossible unless...

1483
01:23:40.562 --> 01:23:42.300
I've been here before.

1484
01:23:50.745 --> 01:23:51.804
What do we do?

1485
01:23:53.541 --> 01:23:55.445

01:24:30.117 --> 01:24:31.281
Oh. is he gonna do something?

1502
01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:32.824
I don't know
what's happening.

1503
01:24:32.848 --> 01:24:34.814
Everyone's fucking crazy
out here. Please help me!

1504
01:24:34.949 --> 01:24:36.362
Are you gonna do something.
nothing boy?

1505
01:24:36.386 --> 01:24:38.455
Slater. I'm scared!

1506
01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.158
Don't open the door.

1507
01:24:41.292 --> 01:24:42.594
Don't open the door. Okay.

1508
01:24:52.039 --> 01:24:53.569
Shit!

1509
01:24:57.339 --> 01:24:58.743
I'm really sorry.

1510
01:25:00.913 --> 01:25:01.913
Look at you.

1511
01:25:03.018 --> 01:25:05.115
- Please!
- You're beautiful.

1512
01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:06.415
Come here. Come here. Stop.

1513
01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:08.782
Stop. stop.
It's okay. All right?

1514
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:13.259
Hi.

1515
01:25:18.996 --> 01:25:20.029
Hi.

1516
01:25:26.369 --> 01:25:28.840
Yeah. It's good there.

1517
01:26:02.439 --> 01:26:04.211
I like your nails.

1518
01:26:06.444 --> 01:26:08.908
That's gonna scar.

1519
01:26:16.684 --> 01:26:17.851
You havin' a good time?

1520
01:26:20.324 --> 01:26:21.324
I'm having a great...

1521
01:26:23.995 --> 01:26:25.364
Hi.

1522
01:26:27.462 --> 01:26:28.961
Welcome back.

1523
01:26:32.302 --> 01:26:33.806
Fucking bitch.

1524
01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:35.842
Ah... Fuck him.

1525
01:26:35.977 --> 01:26:37.277
Don't worry about him.

1526
01:26:37.412 --> 01:26:39.052
He's just still mad
about the pinky thing.

1527
01:26:40.814 --> 01:26:41.814
Fuck!

1528
01:26:41.877 --> 01:26:43.412
I thought last year
was intense.

1529
01:26:43.548 --> 01:26:46.147
but you've really
outdone yourself.

1530
01:26:51.759 --> 01:26:52.787
So...

1531
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:55.691
everybody's dead.

1532
01:26:57.699 --> 01:26:59.160
What now?

1533
01:26:59.295 --> 01:27:00.829
I'm just saying.

1534
01:27:00.964 --> 01:27:03.936
there is a version of this
where we're all just

1535
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:05.668
still havin' a good time.

1536
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:09.474
And sipping mimosas
and green juices.

1537
01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.009
And laughing at brunch.

1538
01:27:14.548 --> 01:27:16.377
'Cause brunch.
brunch is real.

1539
01:27:16.513 --> 01:27:18.747
Brunch is so fucking real.

1540
01:27:21.156 --> 01:27:23.015
You want to know
what's not real?

1541
01:27:30.227 --> 01:27:31.489
Forgiveness.

1542
01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.129
I'll show you.

1543
01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.572
I. Slater King. would like
to formally apologize

1544
01:27:36.596 --> 01:27:37.865
for my behavior.

1545
01:27:38.534 --> 01:27:40.001
I've sought therapy.

1546
01:27:40.136 --> 01:27:41.749
and I'm gonna take a leave
of absence from my company

1547
01:27:41.773 --> 01:27:44.938
while I face these issues
head-on. I'm sorry.

1548
01:27:48.817 --> 01:27:49.943
I'm sorry.

1549
01:27:51.316 --> 01:27:52.913
I'm sorry.

1550
01:27:55.924 --> 01:27:57.357
I'm sorry. I'm...

1551
01:27:58.927 --> 01:28:00.987
I'm... I'm sorry.

1552
01:28:01.929 --> 01:28:03.462
I'm sorry.

1553
01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:09.732
I'm sorry.

1554
01:28:11.336 --> 01:28:12.970
I'm sorry!

1555
01:28:13.105 --> 01:28:14.433
I'm sorry!

1556
01:28:14.568 --> 01:28:16.039
I'm sorry!

1557
01:28:16.174 --> 01:28:17.436
I'm sorry!

1558
01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:18.943
I'm sorry!

1559
01:28:19.078 --> 01:28:20.274
I'm sorry!

1560
01:28:20.409 --> 01:28:21.715
I'm sorry!

1561
01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:22.850
I'm sorry!

1562
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:23.950
I'm sorry!

1563
01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:25.083
I'm sorry!

1564
01:28:25.183 --> 01:28:26.214
I'm sorry!

1565
01:28:26.349 --> 01:28:27.349
I'm sorry!

1566
01:28:27.416 --> 01:28:28.447
I'm sorry!

1567
01:28:28.582 --> 01:28:30.049
I'm sorry!

1568
01:28:35.593 --> 01:28:36.793
So. we good?

1569
01:28:39.031 --> 01:28:40.031
No?

1570
01:28:41.266 --> 01:28:42.732
That's right.

1571
01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:49.376
There is no forgiveness.

1572
01:28:51.275 --> 01:28:53.076
There's just

1573
01:28:53.211 --> 01:28:55.013
forgetting.

1574
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:56.680
There's just forgetting.

1575
01:28:59.247 --> 01:29:01.683
Which. by the way.
you are fucking incredible at.

1576
01:29:01.819 --> 01:29:04.187
You forgot about
the entire goddamn place.

1577
01:29:04.322 --> 01:29:05.322
That's amazing.

1578
01:29:05.391 --> 01:29:06.511
Imagine what humans could be

1579
01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:09.925
capable of if we could
free them

1580
01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:13.532
from the suffering
and the pain of their trauma.

1581
01:29:13.668 --> 01:29:16.836
Oh. my God. my sister.
my sister would be...

1582
01:29:16.972 --> 01:29:18.031
she'd be free.

1583
01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:19.965
She'd be free
'cause she's so fucked up.

1584
01:29:20.101 --> 01:29:21.706
because she remembers
everything.

1585
01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:24.136
She remembers every
single thing. She's. like...

1586
01:29:24.272 --> 01:29:26.612
"How could you go and
play tennis with that man

1587
01:29:26.747 --> 01:29:28.507
after what he did to us
when we were little?"

1588
01:29:28.642 --> 01:29:30.617
And I'm. like...

1589
01:29:30.752 --> 01:29:33.446
I'm over here just.
like. "What did he do?"

1590
01:29:33.582 --> 01:29:35.054
"What did he do?"

1591
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:36.848
"What the fuck did he do?"

1592
01:29:36.983 --> 01:29:38.722
"I don't know what he did."

1593
01:29:47.763 --> 01:29:49.365
This is gonna be great.

1594
01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:54.337
We can forget
all of this.

1595
01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:57.074
Come on. Me and you both.

1596
01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.544
Let's just...

1597
01:30:00.874 --> 01:30:02.812
Just a quick spritz.

1598
01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:06.478
What do you think?

1599
01:30:06.614 --> 01:30:07.817
Well...

1600
01:30:10.017 --> 01:30:11.517
I feel...

1601
01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:15.254
Fuck!

1602
01:30:15.389 --> 01:30:17.272
- I feel like...
- Okay. um...

1603
01:30:17.296 --> 01:30:19.092
Hold that thought.

1604
01:30:20.201 --> 01:30:21.600
I'm gonna be right back.

1605
01:30:22.735 --> 01:30:24.236
I want to hear
what you want to say.

1606
01:30:24.372 --> 01:30:25.572
I'm gonna be right back. okay?

1607
01:31:02.872 --> 01:31:04.152

You're right.
There is no forgiveness.

Only forgetting.
