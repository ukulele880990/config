﻿1
00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.705
Okay. turn left up here.

2
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.307
And can you step on the gas

3
00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:10.275
a little?

4
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:15.925
Hey!
Off the gas!

5
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.049
Off the gas!

6
00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:18.595
Does somebody else
want to drive here?

7
00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.330
Phoebe. the demon
is not waiting around

8
00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.087
for us to come and vanquish him.

9
00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.789
We don't even know if we have
the power to vanquish him.

10
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.436
Scrying for random evil
tells us nothing.

11
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.904
It tells us
where the demons are.

12
00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.572
and since we vanquished two
already this week.

13
00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.840
I'd say
it's working pretty well.

14
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.298
Yeah. thanks to Cole
for saving our butts.

15
00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.945
Two witches
and a half a demon does not

16
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.669
the Power of Three make.

17
00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.582
So what are we supposed to do.
sit around

18
00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.418
and wait for them
to pick us all off?

19
00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.653
If we weren't going after them.
they'd be coming after us.

20
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.155
They're coming after you
anyway. Piper.

21
00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.445
The Source is coming after you.

22
00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:47.857
And we won't be ready for him.

23
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.549
because instead of teaching
Paige how to be a witch.

24
00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:53.252
we are out hunting
for every Tom. Dick and...

25
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.521
Beelzebub in San Francisco.

26
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.700
Speaking of. do we have any kind
of plan here or...?

27
00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.069
The plan is to vanquish
the demon.

28
00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.504
Great. Any chance you've
mastered your powers.

29
00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:02.506
or are you still freezing
and exploding at random?
Random.

30
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.862
But you know what they say...

31
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.771
There's nothing like
field practice. Turn here!

34
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:21.113
Hey. big scary demon.

35
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:23.148
Huh?

36
00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.169

Yeah?

61
00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.480
What's the hold-up
on the O'Brien application?

62
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:26.064
Well. at the moment.
the only hold-up is

63
00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:30.108
my boss is standing over me.
distracting me from my work.

64
00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:31.776
Nice teeth.

65
00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.112
Have it on my desk by noon.

66
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.294
Lila!

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:39.762
What's the O'Brien application?

68
00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.130
Adam O'Brien?
The foster kid

69
00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.032
we're trying
to get into the boarding school?

70
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.257
Oh. my God.

71
00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:47.204
The scholarship application
is due. like. today.

72
00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:49.894
I'm so lame.

73
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.332
Aw. Billy. I thought

74
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.301
I told you to throw anything
from creditors in the trash.

75
00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.338
Hi... pizza-face.

76
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.240
Look. I understand

77
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.348
how difficult it is
to tear yourself away

78
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.188
from the cleavage
in this section.

79
00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.511
<i>but</i> I'm gonna need

80
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.012
my mail sometime today.

81
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.381
okay?
No problem.

82
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.519
Go. go.

83
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.391
Nice rug.

84
00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:25.430
What the hell!

85
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.544
- Look at him!
- What happened to his hair.

86
00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.903
I didn't know he was bald!

87
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.656
Oh. I know that
you're happy that
we got him Piper.

88
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.581
but is it entirely necessary
to disfigure<i> The Book?</i>

89
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.015
Hmm. this one could incinerate

90
00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.285
human flesh with his eyes.

91
00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.553
That must sting.

92
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.690
You think that's funny?

93
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.359
You could have gotten yourself
killed. you understand that?

94
00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:56.995
Yes. Cole. I understand
"killed" very well.

95
00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.576
Then why would you
want to keep risking
your life and Phoebe's?

96
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.880
Not to mention mine.

97
00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.280
There's a legion of
bounty hunters on my ass.

98
00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:05.382
I'm supposed to be
laying low. but instead.

99
00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:06.883
I'm out protecting you guys!

100
00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:10.041
You know what. Cole?
Next time you can stay home.

101
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.644
If you insist on taking these
suicide missions. you force me

102
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.223
to be there. because there's

103
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.059
no way in hell I am
about to let Phoebe
lose another sister.

104
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.530
Why don't you go see
who's at the door for us. okay?
Sure.

105
00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:23.800
If it's the Source.
I'll just ask him
to come back later.

106
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:27.091
We need to talk.

107
00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:32.230
Piper. Cole's right.

108
00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:34.210
We have a system
for fighting demons.

109
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.279
and it's worked pretty well
for the last three years.

110
00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.303
I think. uh. Prue being killed

111
00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.939
counts as a pretty big
glitch in the system.

112
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.084
I know that

113
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.554
you're angry... I am angry. too.

114
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.378
Then why are you
fighting me on this?

115
00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.487
What is the problem with
getting a little proactive?

116
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.350
Because we're not ready
to get proactive.

117
00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.851
that's what's wrong with it.

118
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.432
We're barely ready for
anything right now.

119
00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:57.434
I mean. just dealing
with our everyday.

120
00:05:57.458 --> 00:05:58.990
normal lives is hard enough.

121
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.525
That is precisely the point.

122
00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:02.327
The faster we get rid
of these demons.

123
00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.796
the faster we can get back
to our everyday. normal lives.

124
00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.565
or at least
what is left of them.

125
00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:07.966
Knock. knock.

126
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.703
I. uh...

127
00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:13.137
I'm sorry to just

128
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.752
drop by without
calling.
Uh. it's okay.

129
00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:16.941
don't worry about it.

130
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.456
I don't know exactly
why I'm here.

131
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.024
I'm just kind of
having a hard time

132
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.127
being surrounded
by people and...
And not be able

133
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.753
to tell them that
you can move things
with your mind?

134
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:32.056
It does not exactly
roll off the tongue.

135
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.292
Yeah. Well. being a witch
is tough on friendships.

136
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.795
That's why the whole
sister thing comes in
so handy.

137
00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:37.929
What are you doing?

138
00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.431
Um...

139
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.043
it's a little chatty up here.

140
00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.802
so I'm gonna go scry
for evil in my room.

141
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.270
Scry?

142
00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.783
Yeah.

143
00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:49.708
uh... Phoebe will explain.

144
00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.643
I'll see you later.

145
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.081
It's kind of like a. um...

146
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.284
supernatural LoJack.

147
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.353
Well. why don't you
just use that big book?

148
00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:05.590
I mean. it is a book
of spells. right?

149
00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.559
Oh. it's a lot more than that.

150
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.194
It's kind of hard to explain.

151
00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:13.598
It looks so old.

152
00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.802
Yeah. It has
survived a lot.

153
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.515
Fortunately. it protects itself

154
00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:19.871
from evil.

155
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.173
It protects itself? How?

156
00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:23.742
Magic.

157
00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:26.978
May I?

158
00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:31.716
Yeah. Technically
it's yours. too.

159
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.329
I would walk you through it

160
00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:36.521
right now. but I have
to go talk to Cole.

161
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.190
Well. maybe I could just
take it back to my office.

162
00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.191
Oh. no. no. no.

163
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.027
No. It doesn't
leave the house.

164
00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:44.273
But just feel free

165
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.909
to thumb through it. and then

166
00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:48.493
I'll be back in a few minutes.

167
00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:59.511
This could solve
a lot of problems.

168
00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.589
What? What is it?
What's wrong?

169
00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.602
You've got to talk to your wife.

170
00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:15.126
Okay. Cole. remember what I said
about being gentle?

171
00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:16.862
What about my wife?

172
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.210
She's out of control.

173
00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.565
Cole!
What?

174
00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:23.735
It's just we're very worried
about her.

175
00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:24.970
What happened?

176
00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.905
She's very. very angry.

177
00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:29.686
Well. of course she's angry...
she's grieving.
Right.

178
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.142
And if she were punching walls.

179
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.422
I would happily call
a repairman...
The problem is.

180
00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.047
she prefers to punch demons.

181
00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:37.649
Well. I'll talk to her.

182
00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:40.396
She has no regard
for her own life.
or anyone else's.

183
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.987
She's Charles Bronson cubed.

184
00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:44.088
I said I'd talk to her.

185
00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.797
Guys. guys...

186
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.994
Who is Charles Bronson?

187
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.132
Never mind.

188
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.467
Can we please just have
a minute alone?

189
00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:59.905
- Sure.
- Thank you.

190
00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.143
Uh. it's not just that
she's violent. Leo;

191
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.223
she's acting nothing
like herself.

192
00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:09.948
She's completely dismissive
of Paige.

193
00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.228
and...

194
00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:14.597
I don't know what to do anymore.

195
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:15.854
Strange. isn't it?

196
00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:17.622
Now on top of everything else.

197
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:19.558
you have to play
the middle sister.

198
00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:22.761
when you've always been
the. uh...

199
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.106
Screw-up?

200
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.898
The youngest.

201
00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.912
Yeah. I look at Paige and Piper.

202
00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:31.414
it makes me think back
to all those times

203
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:34.851
that Piper had
to play mediator
between me and Prue.

204
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:37.075
Not a lot of fun. huh?

205
00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.811
It's not a job I
would have asked for.

206
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.214
and I'm not sure it's a job
I'm gonna be any good at.

207
00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.283
But... I just...

208
00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:48.653
I don't have time to really
worry about it right now.

209
00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.623
I'll talk to her.

210
00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:53.625
Thanks. Leo.

211
00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:56.039
Not to rush this tender moment.

212
00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:58.623
but she's already
started scrying.

213
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.999
Oh!

214
00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:05.036
I didn't mean
you couldn't use the stairs!

215
00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:24.756
Okay. book. protect yourself.

216
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.544
Paige!

217
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.368
I'll be right up!

218
00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.938
Whoa!

219
00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:41.818
Where's the fire?
Uh. you know. work.

220
00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:43.508
Lunch break's over.
Gotta go.

221
00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.655
But we didn't even get to talk.

222
00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.612
Oh. yeah.
it's all right.
Don't worry.

223
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.080
Will you come by later?

224
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.982
Sure. yeah. absolutely.

225
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.450
Bye.

226
00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.022
Bye.

227
00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:02.627
Look. honey...

228
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:05.530
it isn't just that
it's dangerous.

229
00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.299
Leo. whitelighters are supposed
to guide. not judge.

230
00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:09.801
Just because I'm doing things

231
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.270
a little bit differently
doesn't mean there is a problem.

232
00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.482
Piper. I'm your husband.

233
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.217
not just your
whitelighter.
and when you

234
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.520
speak to me like that.
there<i> is</i> a problem.

235
00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:19.210
I can't help you

236
00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.179
unless you talk to me.

237
00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:25.249
It hurts to talk. Leo.

238
00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:27.652
It hurts to breathe.

239
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.654
So unless you have some idea

240
00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:33.725
of how to bring Prue back.
I don't want to talk right now.

241
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.762
Is that what you
don't want to say?

242
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.397
Is that you still blame me

243
00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.577
for not being able
to bring her back?
No. Leo.

244
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:43.501
I don't blame you.

245
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.869
I blame evil.

246
00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:47.906
Why... why do you think
I am doing all of this.

247
00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.652
for kicks?
Honestly?

248
00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.253
I think you're doing it because

249
00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:55.117
it's easier than
confronting what
you're really feeling.

250
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.253
Demon.
What?

251
00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:03.621
I have work to do.

252
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.059
Cole. Phoebe. let's go.

253
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.772
Nothing like a copy
room with a view.

254
00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:28.244
Hey. Clearasil. what's poppin'?

255
00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:33.930
Don't worry about him. Billy.

256
00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:35.954
He's a jerk to everybody.
Yeah. I know.

257
00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:39.791
That's why his mail
gets lost... frequently.

258
00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.573
Hey. is there something
wrong with this copier?

259
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.930
The copier?

260
00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:48.432
I don't think so.
I just ran off a whole bunch.

261
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.434
Everything keeps
coming up blank.

262
00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:53.671
Are you trying to copy a book?

263
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.906
Nah. it's nothing.

264
00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.095
It's cool.
Well. if-if you need me

265
00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:59.744
to do it for you.
just say the word.

266
00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.512
Thanks. You're sweet.

267
00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:17.361
"Let the object of objection

268
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.397
"become but a dream.

269
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.600
as I cause the seen
to be unseen."

270
00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:27.305
You okay. Billy?

271
00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:30.909
Yeah. I-I just. uh.
got a little head rush.

272
00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:38.883
Oh my. God. it worked!

273
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.923
Oh. my God!

274
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.128
Paige. is. uh. everything okay?

275
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:52.864
It will be from now on.

276
00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.073
Piper. Cole and I
do not support you in this.

277
00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.843
If you insist on doing it.
you are going in alone!

278
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.377
Okay. I'll see you at home.

279
00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:07.645
Told you that wouldn't work.

280
00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:08.925
It was worth a shot.

281
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.849
Wait a minute.
Do you smell smoke?

282
00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.751
It's in there.

283
00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:21.392
Stop! Stop! No!

284
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.726
Get back.
I'll blow it up.

285
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.349
Go on.

286
00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:35.975
Uh. Piper?

287
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.076
Yeah. yeah! Crap!

288
00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.079
Okay.

289
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.152
Piper!

290
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.520
Wha...?

291
00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:01.132
Piper. let them go!

292
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:06.939
Uh-oh.

293
00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:15.258
Th-Th-They're immune
to my powers.

294
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:17.215
Unfortunately. Cole isn't.

295
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.626
Piper. unfreeze him!

296
00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.361
What if I blow him up?

297
00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:38.403
Cole...

298
00:15:57.223 --> 00:15:59.235
I'm gonna take out those
chain smoking bitches

299
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.359
if it's the last thing I do.

300
00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.306
It might be
the last thing you do.

301
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.096
That's very supportive. Cole.

302
00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:06.497
Whose side are you on?

303
00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:07.977
At the moment.
I'm on Phoebe's side.

304
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.041
Well. the last time I checked.

305
00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:11.669
Phoebe was still my sister.

306
00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.316
which technically
puts her on my side.

307
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.550
Why are we arguing?

308
00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:16.385
We're not arguing.
we're discussing.

309
00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:17.886
Piper. you are arguing.

310
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.021
And. look. you're already hurt.

311
00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:19.978
I'm fine.

312
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.223
You can't stop coughing.

313
00:16:21.247 --> 00:16:22.491
And your control
over your powers

314
00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.449
seems to be getting
worse. not better.

315
00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:26.362
Well. our powers are
tied to our emotions.

316
00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.030
so it makes sense
that they would be

317
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.231
a little off right now.

318
00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:31.422
All the more reason to lay low.

319
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.790
These demons are dangerous.

320
00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.225
All the more reason

321
00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:35.393
to vanquish them.

322
00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:37.928
Okay. that is what we do.
eliminate evil.

323
00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.108
Regardless of the consequences.

324
00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:40.132
Now you sound like Prue.

325
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.202
Okay. Cole. I'm going to
vanquish the cancer girls

326
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.310
with or without your help.

327
00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:46.937
So either you tell me
what you know

328
00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.106
or get out of the way.

329
00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:54.412
They're called Furies.

330
00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:56.147
Like from mythology?

331
00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:57.948
The dog-faced women from hell?

332
00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.296
They're modern knock-offs.
their MO is the same though.

333
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.620
They punish evildoers?
Exactly.

334
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.866
Wait. wouldn't that
make them good?

335
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.834
Well. these Furies
have no temperance.

336
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.070
They'll go after a shoplifter
as soon as a murderer

337
00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.705
and they take great
pleasure in the kill.

338
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.729
Great.
Then we'll take great pleasure

339
00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:12.764
in the vanquish.

340
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.371
What aren't you telling us?

341
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.108
So they go after evildoers.

342
00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:25.510
Have they attacked you before?

343
00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.326
When they focus
their thoughts on you.

344
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.760
they force you to hear the cries

345
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.064
of all your former victims.

346
00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:36.554
You're not the demon
who did those things anymore.

347
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.112
Evil got<i> The Book of Shadows.</i>

348
00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:51.747
How did evil get
<i>The Book of Shadows?</i>

349
00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:54.272
Oh. no.
"Oh. no"?

350
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.951
Phoebe. a demon has
<i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

351
00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:57.319
"Oh. no" doesn't quite cover it.

352
00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.755
Let me go see
what I can find out.
No. wait.

353
00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.579
Uh. Piper...

354
00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.359
promise me you're not
gonna overreact.

355
00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.516
Is that even possible?

356
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.852
I think that. uh. maybe...

357
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.321
Well. it might-might

358
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.022
be feasible

359
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.591
that. uh...

360
00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:17.261
Paige borrowed<i> The Book.</i>

361
00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.699
What? Why. why. why.

362
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.312
why would you think that?!

363
00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:25.803
See. now this is what I meant
about overreacting.

364
00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.371
It's just that I...
You let

365
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.807
Paige take<i> The Book of Shadows</i>
out of the manor?

366
00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.342
Well. no. I did not let her.

367
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.878
It's just she left pretty quick
and...

368
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.158
it looks like she might have...

369
00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:37.982
Out of the window?

370
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.850
Piper. I am...

371
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.487
Phoebe. why would you even
leave her alone with it?

372
00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:44.688
Well. because she's our sister.

373
00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:47.458
Not for long.

374
00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.204
Are you coming?

375
00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:01.038
To vanquish your sister?

376
00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.040
I think I'll sit this one out.

377
00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.049
It's unbelievable.

378
00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:14.352
Maybe it was the light
from the copy machine.

379
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.232
God. this day is amazing.

380
00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:17.699
I mean you went and got cute.

381
00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.135
You think?
Totally.

382
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.836
And then my car loan
comes through.

383
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.937
like. out of nowhere.

384
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:23.739
My credit is worse than Paige's.

385
00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.829
You know. I still
can't believe all this.

386
00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.131
It's amazing.

387
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.267
Sir. I am taking
full responsibility

388
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.613
for being late
with the application.

389
00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.871
I'm simply asking
for a deadline extension.

390
00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.507
Well. I'm asking that
you not punish Adam O'Brien.

391
00:19:36.576 --> 00:19:38.654
He's already had a tough enough
life for my mistake.

392
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.911
We're working fast
to straighten this thing out.

393
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.146
Sir. all I'm saying is..

394
00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:46.784
"These words will travel
through the minds

395
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.286
"of stubborn parties and unbind

396
00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:49.831
"the thoughts too rigid
to be kind.

397
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.856
a compromise they'll
dis-entwine."

398
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.792
How does 6:00 on Friday sound?

399
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.394
6:00 Friday is perfect.

400
00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:58.529
Thank you so much.

401
00:19:58.598 --> 00:20:00.097
Victory.

402
00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.899
You got the extension?

403
00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:02.900
Yeah.

404
00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.335
Unbelievable.

405
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:05.981
You're into all that
witchy stuff. right?

406
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.805
Excuse me?

407
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.051
Well. I'm just thinking

408
00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.919
that there must be something
in the stars today.

409
00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:13.422
I mean Billy's face.
my car. now this.

410
00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:15.658
Is there a full moon
or something?

411
00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:18.249
I don't know.
but whatever it is.

412
00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.758
I'm gonna call
my student loan sharks

413
00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:20.985
and take full advantage of it.

414
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.387
Ooh. good.
Me. too.

415
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:26.657
You know. Paige...

416
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.527
as a lawyer.

417
00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:31.507
I could get those
nasty creditors

418
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:34.076
off your back so easily.

419
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.178
And if you can't
afford to pay me.

420
00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:38.936
I could always just
take it out in trade.

421
00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.972
Or I could just sue your ass
for sexual harassment

422
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:44.342
and pay you with my big
fat punitive settlement.

423
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:47.445
The way you dress?

424
00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:49.680
The judge would admire
my restraint.

425
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.416
That's it.

426
00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:01.492
Perfect. I'll just change
"demon" to "dirtbag."

427
00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:04.462
I don't understand how
someone can be that stupid.

428
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.490
I don't understand why
you haven't stopped ranting

429
00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:08.031
since we left the house.

430
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.411
You're right. you're right.

431
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.368
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.969
Yes. Paige made a mistake.

433
00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:13.081
A mistake?!

434
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.316
She stole from us.

435
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.740
She borrowed.
Borrowed.

436
00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:18.542
She... she threw
our family heritage

437
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.910
out of the window.

438
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:22.380
Well. that's because
we never took the time

439
00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.248
to explain its significance.

440
00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:25.683
It was just a book to her.

441
00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.630
Okay. Phoebe.
it's not just a book.

442
00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:30.588
it's like... it-it-it is
like part of our family.

443
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.725
Paige is not a killer.

444
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.126
She didn't kill anyone.

445
00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:38.596
And she's not a demon that
we're on our way to vanquish.

446
00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.008
I get that. Phoebe.
Do you?

447
00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:41.432
Because I don't think
that you do.

448
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:42.544
You all right?

449
00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:44.747
Hey! Get away
from me!

450
00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:49.206
Who's your mama?
What the hell is going on?

451
00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:50.275
It's not funny!

452
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.976
Give Mama some sugar!

453
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.845
Whoo! Who's the man?!

454
00:21:57.216 --> 00:21:57.981
You...

455
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.117
are so...

456
00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:04.922
busted.

457
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.324
Hello.

458
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.293
You stole our sacred book

459
00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:12.763
so you could perform magical
plastic surgery on yourself?!

460
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.276
You think I did this on purpose?

461
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.860
My body was perfectly fine
just as it was. thank you.

462
00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:18.836
I mean it. get away from me!

463
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:23.741
Piper. you could have
just blown up

464
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.943
a dozen innocent people.
I took a chance.

465
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.045
See. are you listening
to yourself?

466
00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.124
What happened?

467
00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:31.460
I don't know. they just grew.

468
00:22:31.484 --> 00:22:32.628
Oh. right.

469
00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:34.330
and you had
nothing to do with that.

470
00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:36.253
Did you cast any spells?

471
00:22:36.322 --> 00:22:38.622
One.

472
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.925
Five.
Five?!

473
00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:44.928
Okay. what did you do
just before

474
00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:46.263
you turned into Betty Boop?

475
00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:49.467
Well. I cast a spell on
the slimeball I work with

476
00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:52.536
so I could give him a taste
of his own medicine.

477
00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:54.365
Uh-huh.
That the slimeball?

478
00:22:57.844 --> 00:22:59.543
And that's the backfire.

479
00:22:59.612 --> 00:23:01.645
Backfire?

480
00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:04.382
You misused magic to make him
the object of ogling.

481
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.762
and the spell backfired
and did the same thing to you.

482
00:23:06.786 --> 00:23:09.319
Which you would have learned
if you had bothered to ask.

483
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:10.866
but now instead
of vanquishing demons.

484
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.450
we're gonna have to spend
the afternoon fixing your mess.

485
00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:16.460
Okay. Piper. call Leo

486
00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.497
and get him to orb
this slimeball back home.

487
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.565
We have to protect him
until we can figure out

488
00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:22.966
a way to reverse the spell.

489
00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:25.803
Paige and I will grab
<i>The Book</i> and meet you there.

490
00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:37.948
<i>Are my boobs gonna
stay this way forever?</i>

491
00:23:38.017 --> 00:23:40.451
Not if I can ever
find the spell.

492
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.219
What about Piper?

493
00:23:42.288 --> 00:23:44.132
She gonna stay
mad at me forever?

494
00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:45.623
No.

495
00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:47.758
It's just. um...

496
00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:49.927
she hasn't really
been herself lately.

497
00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:52.830
You know. a lot of ups and downs

498
00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:55.933
since Prue. you know.
like us all.

499
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:58.480
The last thing I wanted
to do was to add to

500
00:23:58.504 --> 00:23:59.637
you guys' stress.

501
00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:01.517
I just wanted
to get back at Donnie.

502
00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:04.542
Yeah. and I understand
the temptation. Paige.
I really do.

503
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.811
But I told you.<i> The Book</i>
does not leave the house.

504
00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:08.011
Right.

505
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.080
Sorry.

506
00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.716
My boobs are in the way.

507
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:15.163
Can you put it
into third for me?

508
00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.187
All right.

509
00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:17.855
Ready? Here we go.

510
00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:19.790
All right.

511
00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:22.037
Did you find the spell yet?

512
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:23.226
No. but I...

513
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.529
found the demons.

514
00:24:25.598 --> 00:24:26.864
Oh. my God.

515
00:24:26.933 --> 00:24:28.209
What? You can't
say "demons"

516
00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:29.344
followed by
"Oh. my God."

517
00:24:29.368 --> 00:24:31.112
I'm new at this.
I'm likely to panic.

518
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.736
Okay. Uh...

519
00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:35.072
Fury smoke kills
bad guys. right?

520
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.239
But in good people.

521
00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.176
it looks for a portal
of unexpressed fury.

522
00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.288
And?

523
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.714
It builds until it
consumes your humanity

524
00:24:43.783 --> 00:24:45.816
and turns you into a Fury.

525
00:24:45.885 --> 00:24:48.218
Um... we fought
the Furies today.

526
00:24:48.287 --> 00:24:50.020
Piper got smoked.

527
00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:51.522
Wait.

528
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:53.469
Are you saying that Piper's
turning into a demon?

529
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:56.494
It wouldn't be the first time.

530
00:24:56.562 --> 00:24:58.061
Uh. step on it
and hit the clutch.

531
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.062
I'm going into fourth.
Ready?

532
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:01.064
On three.
One. two. three.

533
00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:05.268
Oh!

534
00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.037
Easy. Piper.

535
00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:08.506
What. are you
protecting him now?

536
00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:10.574
What the hell is going on?

537
00:25:10.643 --> 00:25:12.510
And what's with the chicks?
They've gone crazy.

538
00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:14.845
This "chick"
just saved your ass.

539
00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:16.213
you sniveling ingrate.

540
00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.548
Do...

541
00:25:17.617 --> 00:25:18.916
Do you see what I mean?

542
00:25:18.985 --> 00:25:21.385
Who said you could get up?

543
00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.800
What's the matter with you?

544
00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:25.923
Oh. my God.

545
00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:27.068
Okay. honey. look.

546
00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:28.303
I don't know what's going on.

547
00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:29.771
but we really need to talk.

548
00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:32.530
Leo. you know what?

549
00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:34.131
I'm sick of talking.

550
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.149
Now we really need to talk.

551
00:25:41.173 --> 00:25:44.107
Piper. you do not use
your powers on a mortal.

552
00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:45.420
do you hear me?

553
00:25:45.444 --> 00:25:49.284
Back away slowly. Leo.

554
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:50.213
What?

555
00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.983
She's becoming a Fury.

556
00:25:56.022 --> 00:25:57.942
There's no reasoning
with her now.

557
00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:01.224
Piper. you're a good witch.
do you hear me?!

558
00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:02.392
Fight this.

559
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.037
Oh. God. help! Ah!

560
00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.506
No!

561
00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:22.339
Cole!

562
00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:24.514
I... Well...

563
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.185
That wasn't very nice.

564
00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.999
Cole hit her with
an energy ball!

565
00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:43.367
Leo. it was a low voltage.

566
00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.046
Would you prefer he'd let
her kill an innocent?

567
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.271
I'd prefer that he wouldn't use
his demonic powers on my wife!

568
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.685
I can't believe that you
let him go look for her.

569
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.142
Oh. this is all my fault.

570
00:26:52.211 --> 00:26:54.155
I shouldn't have stolen
the Book of Shadows.

571
00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:55.778
You stole the Book of Shadows?!

572
00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:58.148
Leo. Leo. concentrate. please.

573
00:26:58.217 --> 00:26:59.361
I just hope he finds her fast.

574
00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:00.583
because if this is anything

575
00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.320
like the time
I turned into a banshee.

576
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:04.854
she's going to be hungry
for a kill.

577
00:27:04.923 --> 00:27:06.201
I'm sorry. a banshee?

578
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.691
Yeah. a demonic screamer.
kind of trampy. feeds on pain.

579
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.928
I think I need to sit down.

580
00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:13.096
Whoa!

581
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.403
Whoa.

582
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:21.338
Paige!

583
00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:22.572
What?

584
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.685
You only said I couldn't
use magic to punish him.

585
00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:26.109
Okay. Leo...

586
00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:27.555
you orb Donnie back
to his office.

587
00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:28.978
heal him there and then

588
00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:30.525
make sure that he doesn't nark
us out for being witches.

589
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:31.848
How?

590
00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:33.395
I don't know!
Be creative.

591
00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:34.884
What about Piper?

592
00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:37.020
You have to do your job.
and let us do ours.

593
00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:39.889
We'll get your wife back.

594
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:40.958
I promise.

595
00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:51.879
Um. I hate to ask.

596
00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:54.182
but how are we going
to get his wife back?

597
00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:56.806
I mean. she's kind
of a full-on demon.

598
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.309
No. she's not full-on.
she doesn't have the talons yet.

599
00:27:59.378 --> 00:28:01.244
That probably comes
with the first kill.

600
00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:04.081
Besides. if we were
able to save her

601
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.582
when she turned
into a wendigo...

602
00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.794
A wendi what?

603
00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:09.886
Um... a wendigo.

604
00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:11.788
It's kind of like a werewolf.

605
00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.356
only meaner.

606
00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:16.893
Is this the spell that you used?

607
00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:18.661
Uh-huh.

608
00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:23.766
Is there some sort of spell
I could do. you know. in advance

609
00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:26.002
so I could not become
maybe a banshee or...

610
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.004
What word did you
sub demon with?

611
00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.606
Dirtbag.

612
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.809
Dirtbag.

613
00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:42.119
Okay.

614
00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:45.288
Hand.

615
00:28:45.357 --> 00:28:47.257
Guided spirits.

616
00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.858
hear our plea.

617
00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:53.163
Annul this magic. let it be.

618
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.697
Please let it be!

619
00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:04.707
Oh... do you think it worked
a little too well?

620
00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.113
Stop!

621
00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:47.651
I've been looking for you.

622
00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.657
Damn it.

623
00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:54.957
Why isn't it working?

624
00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.937
Because Piper isn't a witch
anymore.

625
00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.496
Can't you just scry
for evil. then?

626
00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:01.476
Do you have any idea
how much evil

627
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.060
is running around San Francisco?

628
00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:06.636
Damn it. Piper.

629
00:30:08.674 --> 00:30:09.739
Whoa.

630
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:12.075
Cole. thank God...

631
00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.910
Don't thank him yet.

632
00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:15.078
You didn't find her?

633
00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.580
I didn't get a chance to look.

634
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:18.293
Every time I used
my sensing powers.

635
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:19.482
a bounty hunter sensed me.

636
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.951
I fought off three of them.

637
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.186
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:24.688
No... it's... it's okay.

639
00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.756
Somehow everything is going

640
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:27.957
to be okay.

641
00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.626
I... I don't have

642
00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:31.027
even a little idea

643
00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:33.040
how everything's going
to be okay...

644
00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:34.130
Phoebe...

645
00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:35.910
You know why? Because nothing
is okay.

646
00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.100
Phoebe...

647
00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.436
My sister is a Fury.
my boyfriend is a demon...

648
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:40.648
Oh. baby. you're bleeding.

649
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.372
Phoebe!

650
00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:45.375
Didn't you say you found me
because Piper cast a spell

651
00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:47.143
to find a lost witch?

652
00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:51.013
Yes. but I also said that
Piper's not a witch anymore.

653
00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:54.884
Yes. but if I could substitute
the word dirtbag for demon.

654
00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:57.031
why can't we substitute
the word sister for witch?

655
00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.122
Would that work?

656
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.892
Well. no. not if she's already
looking for a kill.

657
00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:04.272
The call won't be strong enough.

658
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:05.495
Why not?

659
00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:06.963
Because of the pull of evil.

660
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.576
When I was possessed
by the Woogie.

661
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.966
the bloodlust was so strong...

662
00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:11.234
Woogie?

663
00:31:11.303 --> 00:31:12.335
Don't ask.

664
00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:14.504
The point is.

665
00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:17.133
I don't think she'll
answer the call.

666
00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:21.778
Then we'll add bait.

667
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.752
No.

668
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.019
No... no.

669
00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.921
Are you kidding me. no!

670
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.950
The Furies go after
evildoers. right?

671
00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:38.895
Paige. we are not using
the love of my life as bait!

672
00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.430
Oh. yes. we are.

673
00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:41.598
It's perfect.

674
00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:45.435
Cole. you have been
a demon for over a century.

675
00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:46.969
That is a lot of victims.

676
00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.172
The pain of their cries alone
can kill you.

677
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.752
Yes. but as you said.
I'm not the demon

678
00:31:50.776 --> 00:31:51.708
who did those things anymore.

679
00:31:51.777 --> 00:31:53.443
And if facing my crimes

680
00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:55.111
helps save your sister...

681
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.220
Cole..
Phoebe!

682
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.788
I would do almost anything
for you. you know that.

683
00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.756
But I will not be a coward

684
00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:08.785
for you.
please don't ask me to be.

685
00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.867
We'll need some of your blood.

686
00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.869
Right.

687
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.838
Knife.

688
00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:31.292
Power of the sisters rise.

689
00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:33.916
Course unseen across the skies.

690
00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:37.420
Come to us who call you near.

691
00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:39.789
<i>Come to us and settle here.</i>

692
00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:42.559
<i>Blood to blood. I summon thee.</i>

693
00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.961
<i>Blood to blood. return to me.</i>

694
00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:52.335
I know where evil dwells.

695
00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.409
You sure about this?

696
00:32:59.478 --> 00:33:02.746
I'm good at a lot of things.
waiting is not one of them.

697
00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:06.861
Honey. what are you doing?

698
00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:08.763
I'm trying
to do that orb thingy.

699
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:11.287
I can't seem
to get the hang of it though.

700
00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:16.860
What happened?

701
00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:17.861
You orbed.

702
00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.128
I did?

703
00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:20.963
It's a fear response.
So until
you learn

704
00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.977
how to control it.
you just have to...

705
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:23.833
Get scared?

706
00:33:23.902 --> 00:33:25.201
Pretty much.

707
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.604
All right.

708
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.939
Well. that shouldn't
be too difficult.

709
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.608
Good.
Then we will orb.

710
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.010
we will levitate. we will
juggle knives if we have to.

711
00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.279
just to keep the Furies
distracted from Cole.

712
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.658
Okay. but what I don't get

713
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.727
is how we un-demon Piper
once she gets here.

714
00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:43.119
Well. we have to close
the portal of unexpressed fury.

715
00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:46.188
Unexpressed? I think she's
been raging for days.

716
00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:47.668
That's 'cause there's
something she's not saying.

717
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:48.357
Which is?

718
00:33:48.427 --> 00:33:49.893
I don't know.

719
00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.795
But I think I have an idea.

720
00:33:57.636 --> 00:33:59.135
They're close.

721
00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:02.204
Paige!

722
00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:05.876
I did it again.

723
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.745
I'm so sorry.

724
00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:20.590
Phoebe!

725
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:25.127
Nice decoy. Piper. Two points.

726
00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:33.402
Cole.

727
00:34:36.775 --> 00:34:38.675
Come on.

728
00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:39.743
Lamp!

729
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:44.949
Sorry.

730
00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:47.685
Really sorry.

731
00:34:57.462 --> 00:35:01.297
Cole is not your problem.
Piper. and you know it.

732
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.740
Book!

733
00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:14.878
Please let there be
something in here.

734
00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:18.315
Cole. don't!

735
00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.618
You think I abandoned you.

736
00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:24.420
You think it's my fault
that Prue died.

737
00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:26.489
You blame me. just admit it.

738
00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:33.562
You don't want to kill me Piper.
you don't even know me.

739
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.144
It's not about me.
it's not about Phoebe. is it?

740
00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:38.168
Leo!

741
00:35:45.544 --> 00:35:48.244
Phoebe's not the sister
who abandoned you. It's Prue!

742
00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:49.846
Leo. do something!

743
00:35:56.021 --> 00:35:57.554
Where did he take them?

744
00:35:57.622 --> 00:36:00.389
To what Piper's really angry at.

745
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:12.869
Tell her. Piper.

746
00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:15.498
It's all right to hate her.

747
00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:19.522
You should hate her.

748
00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:23.580
When my parents died.
I hated them for it.

749
00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:26.415
I was alone and I hated them.

750
00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:29.786
It is okay to hate Prue!

751
00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:37.860
How dare you!

752
00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.830
How dare you leave me?!

753
00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:42.777
How could you go and die

754
00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:44.968
and leave me here all alone?!

755
00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:47.103
Please come back!

756
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:51.741
I need you. Please come back.

757
00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.899
It's okay.
It's okay.

758
00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:07.724
It's not okay.

759
00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.904
She risked her life every day

760
00:37:09.928 --> 00:37:12.662
and she never thought
about what would happen

761
00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:15.331
to me and Phoebe
if she was gone.

762
00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:17.311
I know.

763
00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:21.570
How could she think that
I could live without her?

764
00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:51.868
Did you sleep?

765
00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:53.936
Yeah.

766
00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:56.706
Actually better
than I have in a while.

767
00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.476
It's quiet. isn't it?

768
00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:02.745
Early and late.

769
00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:06.215
It's just really. really quiet.

770
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:12.155
Prue was always the first
one up and the last one down.

771
00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:16.159
It's strange
the things that you miss.

772
00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:22.932
So... how scary was I?

773
00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:27.070
Heck. I've seen worse.

774
00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.437
I've been worse.

775
00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:30.472
But. uh...

776
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.843
well. Paige...

777
00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:35.678
She completely freaked?

778
00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:37.680
No. She handled it.

779
00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:40.549
Better than most
people would. I think.

780
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.433
She saved your life.

781
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:47.401
She definitely is a Halliwell...

782
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.391
last name or no.

783
00:38:51.763 --> 00:38:55.064
I know I haven't been
the most welcoming.

784
00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:58.300
I just...

785
00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.837
I miss Prue so much.

786
00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:02.171
It's hard to imagine

787
00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.941
opening up to someone else.

788
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.309
With everything that
happens in our lives.

789
00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:11.114
love just feels like
an invitation for more pain.

790
00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:21.390
So maybe. um...

791
00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:24.019
maybe you don't start with love.

792
00:39:25.263 --> 00:39:27.823
Maybe you just
start with thanks.

793
00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:59.328
Muffins. Thanks.

794
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.198
Busy work.
I'm best in the kitchen.

795
00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:05.634
Prue was the one
that liked to. uh. chase demons.

796
00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:13.242
Man. he's like
a whole new Donnie.

797
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:16.946
What did Leo say to him?

798
00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:23.552
Um... I don't know.

799
00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:27.623
He's a miracle worker.
that husband of mine.

800
00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:33.095
So. how are you?

801
00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:37.733
I've had bad hours.

802
00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:42.004
and hours
that aren't quite so bad.

803
00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:46.075
I guess you know how it is.

804
00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:48.577
Yeah.

805
00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:50.346
When my parents died.

806
00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:54.150
there were some days I didn't
think I'd survive the sadness.

807
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.555
It'll never be okay
that she's gone. Piper.

808
00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.858
But I promise
it will get better.

809
00:41:05.864 --> 00:41:08.564
You know.
Leo could fix that for you.

810
00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:11.167
Oh. it's my first war wound.

811
00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:12.902
Think I'll wear it with pride.

812
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:16.839
Unfortunately. in this family.
it will not be the last.

813
00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:21.043
Well. every family
has its pros and its cons.

814
00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:24.080
A couple of demon battles
in exchange for the power

815
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.481
to clear up my friend's skin.

816
00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.760
I'd say it's worth it.

817
00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.184
The power to what?

818
00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:34.023
He's cute. isn't he?

819
00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:36.237
You should have
seen him yesterday.

820
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:39.929
Okay. uh. you saved my life.

821
00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:43.299
so I guess we're even
on the Book of Shadows swipe.

822
00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:45.768
But. um. Paige. there are rules

823
00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.436
to being a witch.

824
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:51.140
Rules that you will have
to learn and follow.

825
00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:52.808
Well. not to be difficult.

826
00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:55.422
but you're married
to our whitelighter

827
00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.479
and Phoebe's

828
00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.415
shacking up with a demon.

829
00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:02.851
so on balance.
maybe my friend can stay cute?

830
00:42:02.921 --> 00:42:06.822
Okay.

831
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.457
My. my. my.

832
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.993
That pile looks
about the same size

833
00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:13.796
as it did about an hour ago.

834
00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.131
Oh. that was my fault.

835
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.498
I distracted her with muffins.

836
00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.633
And you are?

837
00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:24.440
I'm her sister.

837
