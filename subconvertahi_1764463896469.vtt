00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.300
Here. eat up.

3
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.233
This is a hamburger.

4
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.466
Drink this too.

5
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.666
Do you have somewhere to go?

6
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.500
Can you wash dishes?

7
00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:10.333
Honey.

8
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.400
You know I can't work for the time being.

9
00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.166
We can't pay you.

10
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.133
But you can eat and sleep here.

11
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.733
You're back.

12
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:37.633
Leave it.

13
00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:41.417
Where have you been?

14
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.233
It's been a whole week.

15
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.333
I've always been gone.

16
00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.033
Why care all of a sudden?

17
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.083
Pest control.

18
00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.300
What?

19
00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.966
I got rid of some bugs.

20
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:00.733
I see.

21
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.966
Let me see.

22
00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:28.733
How clumsy.

23
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.217
-Honey.
-All right. boys.

24
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.568
this place is pretty good.

25
00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.417
-Did your trip go okay?
-There. there. it's okay.

26
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.833
Hey. Cherry Boy! Where have you been?

27
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:44.250
You know. your girls were very lonely
when you were gone. but. uh.

28
00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:45.383
don't worry. man. I...

29
00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:47.612
-I took care of that.
-Thanks. Have a seat.

30
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.845
-Hello. sweetie.
-Who are you?

31
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.566
What are you doing?

32
00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.733
What? It's okay. It's okay.

33
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.053
-Let go.
-No. it's okay.

34
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.400
Stop. stop!

35
00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:15.866
Don't worry.

36
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.239
Oh. is that for me?
You want to really piss me off?

37
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.633
Fuck! Jesus!

38
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.133
Come here!

39
00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:54.366
You're fucking dead!

40
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.800
Please forgive me! Don't make me leave.

41
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.366
Please let me stay here.

42
00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:30.978
-I'm sorry...
-It's all right.

43
00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:38.366
You killed a bug. that's all.

44
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:47.533
Nails.

45
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.800
From now on. that's your name.

46
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.500
Sir. what are you doing?

47
00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:12.866
What are you staring at?
I'm elderly. so get up right now!

48
00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.033
Show some goddamn respect!

49
00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.750
Looking down at your phone
as if you don't give a shit.

50
00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:20.533
This seat is designated
for pregnant women like me.

51
00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:22.383
How should I know if that's a baby

52
00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:25.900
or if it's full of food
you shoved down your throat?

53
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.583
-Show me then!
-Stop that!

54
00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:29.750
I said. I'm pregnant.

55
00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:32.700
There's a man in that designated seat.
so why bother me?

56
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.883
Why. you little!

57
00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:35.883
What are you glaring at?

58
00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:38.917
Girls these days don't get married.

59
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.366
don't have kids.

60
00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:43.233
and just want to mooch off men.

61
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:46.050
And they play the pregnancy card
when it's convenient for them!

62
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.566
-What?
-Can you quiet down?

63
00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:49.566
What?!

64
00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:51.217
<i>The exit is to your right.</i>

65
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.883
<i>To go to Bomin Hospital.
please get off at this stop.</i>

66
00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.133
<i>This stop is...</i>

67
00:07:57.833 --> 00:08:00.300
Gosh. you old hag.

68
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.333
Give me some damn space. will you?

69
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.044
-Coming through.
-Excuse me. I'm getting off.

70
00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:13.366
Jeez. move aside.

71
00:08:14.066 --> 00:08:16.033
-Excuse me.
-My goodness!

72
00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:19.050
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.533
Hello? Sir?

74
00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:26.000
It wasn't me. I swear!

75
00:09:05.233 --> 00:09:07.583
Just a moment.

76
00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:11.250
You said you'd help my son.

77
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.750
-Ma'am. you can't do this.
-Can you please help me?

78
00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:15.250
-It'll be quick.
-You can't.

79
00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.250
-I know this is Sinseong Agency.
-No. it's not.

80
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.383
-You've got the wrong place.
-Just hear me out!

81
00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:20.300
Hornclaw.

82
00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:23.883
Snake plants are easy to grow.

83
00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:25.566
It's perfect for beginners.

84
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.866
I bought it for you. though. Take it.

85
00:09:29.966 --> 00:09:32.566
It only needs water twice a year.
And it even flowers.

86
00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:36.417
Jeez.

87
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.050
She just doesn't get it...

88
00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:41.400
You have to be familiar
with growing plants to like it.

89
00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:46.083
I'm afraid I'll kill that thing.
so take it home today.

90
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.066
Greenleaf.

91
00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:49.833
All she sees is bright red.

92
00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:51.943
It's nice to see something green.

93
00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:53.917
That way.

94
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.466
-she can see beyond her world.
-Your estrogen is spiking.

95
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.400
And why care for her so much?

96
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.400
She's always cold in return.

97
00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:05.866
How would you know?

98
00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:09.033
-The weight of time.
-Weight of time?

99
00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:10.133
Exactly.

100
00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:13.900
Gosh. stop wearing knockoffs.

101
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.366
It looks so cheap.

102
00:10:15.466 --> 00:10:17.066
Hey. this is authentic.

103
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.050
Hello. sir.

104
00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:22.966
-Hello. Gadget.
-Long time no see. Sohn.

105
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.717
Can I have a word with you?

106
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.083
CHAIRMAN SHIM

107
00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:32.200
This isn't pest control.
It's just murder-for-hire.

108
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.417
His mistress ruined his wife of 30 years.

109
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.717
Getting rid
of blood-sucking vermin like him

110
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.250
is exactly what pest control is.

111
00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:43.583
PAINFUL DEATH.
LEAVE BEHIND WILL. RETRIEVE WEDDING RING

112
00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:45.900
She says pain is building up

113
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.466
every day like mileage.

114
00:10:48.366 --> 00:10:50.366
Did she give you money?

115
00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:54.366
I said no. but she insisted.
She even bawled her eyes out.

116
00:10:57.633 --> 00:11:01.200
How can we run this place
without these funds?

117
00:11:02.366 --> 00:11:04.083
-If Godmother finds out...
-Gadget.

118
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:05.800
Flies are pests. right?

119
00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:10.083
They feed on dead bodies
and transmit diseases.

120
00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:11.066
You know.

121
00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:14.733
they've been around a long time.
spreading pollen.

122
00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:18.966
They're useful bugs.
managing the ecosystem.

123
00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:22.733
Who cares how dirty it is
when it's helpful to us?

124
00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:26.700
We just need to retrieve the ring.

125
00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:28.566
Let's forget this.

126
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.966
Gadget.

127
00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:32.300
PEST CONTROL REPORT

128
00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.800
15 NG OF BOTULINUM TOXIN
ON A CROWDED SUBWAY...

129
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.633
Okay. there we go. We're done.

130
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:23.166
There you go. Good girl.

131
00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:26.706
The surgery went well.

132
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.300
You did a great thing.

133
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.883
People feel bad for injured strays.

134
00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:35.200
but it's not easy to actually save them.

135
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.550
All right. then.

136
00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:37.866
Ma'am.

137
00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:40.700
This one's already so old.

138
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.702
so the shelter probably won't take her.

139
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.468
Adoption will be hard too.

140
00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:47.583
They may have to put her down.

141
00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:50.500
So. could you make a call for me?

142
00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:53.233
-For what?
-The shelter won't reject her

143
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.800
if the rescuer calls.

144
00:13:55.833 --> 00:13:57.466
Is this part of your job?

145
00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:01.383
It's awful to be abandoned
just because you're old and sick.

146
00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.666
She's already been abandoned once. Right?

147
00:14:04.233 --> 00:14:05.989
It's okay. you'll find a good owner.

148
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.200
Hold on.

149
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.166
Stay there. Good girl.

150
00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:22.000
<i>Is this going to hurt a lot?</i>

151
00:14:22.566 --> 00:14:25.900
I heard they cut you open
while you're still awake.

152
00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:31.733
We'll stitch you up nicely. Don't worry.

153
00:14:32.633 --> 00:14:33.733
Please spare me!

154
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:35.066
Please!

155
00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.700
-You're fine. kid.
-I'm sorry.

156
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.033
Jeez. scared the shit out of me.

157
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.533
Sorry.

158
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.900
Don't be so scared. It'll be fine.

159
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.383
Do you by any chance

160
00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:51.400
want to sell one of your corneas too?

161
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.750
Right now?

162
00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:56.066
It's a headache for us too.
but the client is insisting.

163
00:14:57.533 --> 00:14:58.883
How much for one?

164
00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:02.050
It's fifty million for the kidney.
and I'll add on three big ones.

165
00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:04.166
-Thirty million?
-Yes.

166
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.833
-That's no good.
-Why? What is it?

167
00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:09.917
Look. sir.

168
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.233
I'll be living with one eye for life.
How will 30 million help?

169
00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:15.233
Huh?

170
00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:18.966
Glasses are so expensive these days.
so why go so cheap for a cornea?

171
00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:22.866
All right. then.

172
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.800
I'll give you a big one.

173
00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.383
-Ten.
-Ten big ones?

174
00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:30.400
Ten seconds.

175
00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.500
For me to kill you.

176
00:15:40.133 --> 00:15:41.166
Fucking bastard!

177
00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:58.417
What are you doing? Who sent you?

178
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.200
I heard you pulled out an eye recently.

179
00:16:02.133 --> 00:16:03.750
By taking someone else's client.

180
00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:06.033
Did that bastard Park send you?

181
00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.133
So why steal clients from friends?

182
00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:12.383
-Okay.
-You'll see each other soon in hell.

183
00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:14.083
Is Park dead too?

184
00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:17.417
You must have a specific goal
for you to go this far.

185
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.400
My goal? To become famous.

186
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.083
This is where sensitive nerves are.
You like that?

187
00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:28.233
Please. spare me...

188
00:16:30.966 --> 00:16:32.333
That. I can't do.

189
00:16:32.966 --> 00:16:34.466
All I know is to kill...

190
00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:36.833
slowly...

191
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.800
and painfully.

192
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.000
Where did he go?

193
00:17:32.366 --> 00:17:33.366
What the...

194
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.700
Stop!

195
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.833
Okay! Stop!

196
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.533
You've trespassed. This is my turf.

197
00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.633
Just as bold as I had heard.

198
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.083
You've heard of me?

199
00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:53.750
An from Banpo. Yoon from Dongtan.

200
00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:56.033
And even Gu. today.

201
00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.466
Aren't you wasting your skills
on silly street fights?

202
00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:04.304
So you're a stalker fan?

203
00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:06.966
Farewell.

204
00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:10.050
Hold on!

205
00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:13.217
Wait. hold on!

206
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.300
Let's talk. okay?

207
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.333
Let's settle with this.

208
00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:20.966
Are you sure? I don't go for cheap.

209
00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.550
-I said no. Why do you keep doing this?
-Why not?

210
00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:58.217
You know he's a disgusting pest.

211
00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.866
So why say no?

212
00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:03.033
I know what you mean.
but you've got the wrong place.

213
00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:04.566
I'll do whatever you say.

214
00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:07.200
-Please kill him.
-You need to leave. now.

215
00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:09.900
I can't.

216
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.749
I have to kill that bastard. Han Seong-do.

217
00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:17.066
I can't leave... My poor son...

218
00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:43.696
Have you had something to eat?

219
00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:47.500
If not. join us.

220
00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:58.366
Isn't this a hassle?

221
00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.366
It's easier to use the app.

222
00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.300
You're the only one who does this.

223
00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.366
This is going to take forever.

224
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.733
DECLINED

225
00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:11.133
You cleaned it all up. right?

226
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:14.500
Any cameras or witnesses?

227
00:20:17.866 --> 00:20:18.866
I mean.

228
00:20:19.533 --> 00:20:23.533
I don't get why the client
asked us to kill him

229
00:20:23.633 --> 00:20:25.800
-in such a crowded place.
-Don't worry.

230
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.717
I'll leave before I become useless.

231
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.200
I didn't mean that.

232
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.717
Is this about the woman out there?

233
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.666
It's nothing.

234
00:20:38.466 --> 00:20:40.333
It's a woman named Madam Hong.

235
00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:44.200
Her son's girlfriend
fell victim to druggies.

236
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.533
She died of an overdose.

237
00:20:45.633 --> 00:20:48.900
<i>The son barged in. got pounded.
and now he's in a coma.</i>

238
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.166
I get why she's so upset.

239
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.866
But it's a tricky case. so Sohn declined.

240
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.717
Satisfied?

241
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.583
By the way. I booked you a health exam
at Dr. Chang's hospital.

242
00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.666
Mr. Sohn's orders.

243
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.066
You were showing off.

244
00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:13.233
As if you wanted someone
to acknowledge you.

245
00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:17.566
You chase after targets and pressure them

246
00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:19.325
until they're about to turn crazy.

247
00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:22.217
then kill them
in the most painful way possible.

248
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.383
And that's why

249
00:21:23.466 --> 00:21:25.200
you're called Bullfight.

250
00:21:25.966 --> 00:21:28.550
Enough with the crap. Get to the point.

251
00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:31.866
Instead of those useless.
meaningless jobs.

252
00:21:31.966 --> 00:21:35.633
join us in the good cause of pest control.

253
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.500
Pest control?

254
00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:39.217
To kill off insects?

255
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.033
Exactly. The cockroaches of our society.

256
00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:44.366
We seek to exterminate them

257
00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:46.833
and save people from suffering.

258
00:21:47.966 --> 00:21:49.533
Goodness.

259
00:21:51.866 --> 00:21:53.733
Is this a house of salvation?

260
00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.700
Come on.

261
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.000
You can't just leave.

262
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.366
You prick!

263
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:07.800
Then I'll kill you and leave.

264
00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:11.466
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

265
00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:14.900
Bullfight. you can't do this here.

266
00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:23.666
I get that this place is serious.

267
00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:32.550
He was just kidding around.

268
00:22:32.633 --> 00:22:34.417
Cut him some slack.

269
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.033
Watch who you hire.

270
00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:56.750
There's a lot of protein precipitate
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

271
00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:59.666
Any hand or foot tremors lately?

272
00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:03.200
No. not at all.

273
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.366
Here. the color shows

274
00:23:06.533 --> 00:23:08.083
significant degeneration.

275
00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:10.300
Don't tell the agency for now.

276
00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:12.400
I can't do that.

277
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.466
Then today
will be the last time I see you.

278
00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:22.666
What's your next mission?

279
00:23:24.233 --> 00:23:25.733
You have to take it easy.

280
00:23:29.133 --> 00:23:30.300
Have I ever

281
00:23:31.133 --> 00:23:32.333
taken it easy?

282
00:23:34.966 --> 00:23:36.333
That damn old coot.

283
00:23:38.066 --> 00:23:40.166
Where did he hide it?

284
00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:44.133
For goodness' sake!

285
00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:49.250
Can't you stuff your face
without being so damn loud?

286
00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:50.383
This smell.

287
00:23:50.466 --> 00:23:52.866
I'm sick of it!

288
00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:57.133
Why bother living?

289
00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:02.966
This is for pissing your pants.

290
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.633
Why is this disconnected?

291
00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:18.400
Who are you?

292
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.750
What do you want?

293
00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:21.400
I'll do whatever you ask.

294
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.217
I'm sure those old folks
did whatever you asked too.

295
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.520
So why did you kill them?

296
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.033
You mean Granny Park?

297
00:24:29.666 --> 00:24:31.233
Come on. sir.

298
00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:35.033
They let me go without any charges.

299
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.966
You'll wish that they hadn't.

300
00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:41.066
Start the car.

301
00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:48.066
SILVER LIFE CARE CENTER

302
00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:15.233
Dad!

303
00:25:21.033 --> 00:25:22.633
-Dad!
-Eun-ho.

304
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.233
It wasn't me.

305
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.566
Eun-ho. it wasn't me!

306
00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.166
What's with you?

307
00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:14.566
Come on. stay still.

308
00:26:23.866 --> 00:26:26.842
Don't look at me like that.
You forget things when you're old.

309
00:26:28.866 --> 00:26:33.050
<i>A woman in her forties
died in this accident.</i>

310
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:34.217
<i>According to witnesses.</i>

311
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.666
<i>a prospective suspect was seen
near the vehicle just before the accident.</i>

312
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.917
<i>The suspect parked the car
at this intersection</i>

313
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.700
<i>and left the victim in the car.
aware of the approaching train.</i>

314
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.883
- <i>The suspect chased after the witness</i>
- Crazy world. right?

315
00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:52.383
<i>Up to a nearby police station
and then ran away.</i>

316
00:26:52.466 --> 00:26:55.383
<i>The police are suspecting this to be
a cover-up suicide case</i>

317
00:26:55.466 --> 00:26:57.417
<i>and are looking for the suspect.</i>

318
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.666
<i>-who is a male in his mid-fifties.</i>
-Have a nice day.

319
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.733
You're ten minutes early.

320
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.800
I work on a timely schedule.

321
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.533
Did your boss not train you?

322
00:27:18.633 --> 00:27:21.133
How rude. So...

323
00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:28.666
What the...

324
00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:57.417
STAGED TRAIN ACCIDENT.
POLICE HUNTING DOWN KILLER

325
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.583
How shameful.
for someone who's been so dedicated...

326
00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.417
It's not easy for me either.

327
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.550
But a single stone
can flip over a whole car.

328
00:28:06.633 --> 00:28:08.500
<i>Rules are rules.</i>

329
00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:10.938
<i>-I'll send someone.</i>
-No. I'll do it.

330
00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:13.833
You. Godmother?

331
00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:20.250
Well. I'd be grateful. but...

332
00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:23.033
Where will you find him?

333
00:28:23.133 --> 00:28:24.833
It's obvious where he'll go.

334
00:28:27.633 --> 00:28:29.550
Old people need a lot of care.

335
00:28:29.633 --> 00:28:30.866
Will it be okay?

336
00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:33.033
You know.

337
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.733
"the weight of time."

338
00:28:38.066 --> 00:28:39.333
You're back.

339
00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:47.750
How was it? Did it go well?

340
00:28:47.833 --> 00:28:49.633
Well. I got rid of your headache.

341
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.583
But I guess you weren't waiting for me.

342
00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:53.733
Oh. what the...

343
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.233
What's this?

344
00:28:58.966 --> 00:29:01.733
We asked for the ring. not his fingers.

345
00:29:01.833 --> 00:29:04.083
Check if I got all 28 pieces.

346
00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:05.066
Mr. Sohn.

347
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.583
Could I have a word with you?

348
00:29:07.666 --> 00:29:09.666
We need you as a backup for something.

349
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.900
Damn lunatic.

350
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.500
What is it now?

351
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:35.866
You here for me. Godmother?

352
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.000
What an honor.

353
00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:41.500
What happened?

354
00:29:43.233 --> 00:29:44.466
I saw Eun-ho.

355
00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:47.833
She died. Ten years ago.

356
00:29:52.066 --> 00:29:55.333
If only she hadn't met
that damned preacher...

357
00:29:56.133 --> 00:29:57.900
I wouldn't have had so much rage.

358
00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:01.383
Then perhaps my life
could have been different.

359
00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:03.383
You walked the path given to you.

360
00:30:03.466 --> 00:30:05.400
There's nothing more to life and death.

361
00:32:24.133 --> 00:32:26.400
Just leave. please!

362
00:32:43.866 --> 00:32:45.066
Kill me before you go.

363
00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:46.366
You think I can't?

364
00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:48.500
You think I can't kill you?

365
00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:20.366
I told you to stay calm.

366
00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:22.866
-Or you can't see clearly.
-Don't you get it?

367
00:33:22.966 --> 00:33:25.633
Not everyone can live
as heartlessly as you.

368
00:33:26.166 --> 00:33:28.459
You ruined the mission
because of your feelings.

369
00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:30.533
By the rules. you must die.

370
00:33:37.066 --> 00:33:40.200
This was going to be my last mission.

371
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.550
I was going to grow some flowers
and open a fried chicken place.

372
00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:44.533
So...

373
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.566
You two bore me to death.

374
00:33:54.233 --> 00:33:55.200
Who are you?

375
00:33:56.466 --> 00:33:57.533
Who the heck are you?

376
00:33:58.633 --> 00:34:00.033
We've met before.

377
00:34:00.133 --> 00:34:00.966
Move.

378
00:34:01.466 --> 00:34:02.533
This is my job.

379
00:34:02.633 --> 00:34:03.566
But it's mine too.

380
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.166
Did Sohn send you?

381
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.466
If you had handled your job properly.
I wouldn't have had to come.

382
00:34:19.066 --> 00:34:20.566
So much for being a legend.

383
00:34:20.666 --> 00:34:22.383
Hair turning white. and wrinkles too.

384
00:34:22.466 --> 00:34:24.533
Getting so old already?

385
00:34:25.133 --> 00:34:25.966
Shut up.

386
00:34:30.466 --> 00:34:32.133
I don't need any backup.

387
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.700
Then finish this.

388
00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:37.033
Since it's your job.

389
00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:41.878
They say that when it's time...

390
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.500
those who you miss come out to greet you.

391
00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:48.027
I think my daughter was there...

392
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.133
to tell me it's time.

393
00:34:50.866 --> 00:34:53.050
That I've done enough.

394
00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:54.700
She was there to greet me.

395
00:35:48.066 --> 00:35:49.733
So damn heavy.

396
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.583
His soul is gone.

397
00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:53.566
Well.

398
00:35:54.666 --> 00:35:57.033
shouldn't he be lighter. then?

399
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.083
Goodness. another old friend gone.

400
00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:04.633
He just lived out all his days.

401
00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.400
How cold.

402
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.233
What's this?

403
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:12.717
-This doesn't burn at all.
-There are rocks everywhere.

404
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.383
Just burn it and throw it away.

405
00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:16.050
So nasty.

406
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:21.566
By the way.
Greenleaf is cutting my pay to no end.

407
00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:26.550
Back when Mr. Ryu was around.
things used to be a lot neater.

408
00:36:26.633 --> 00:36:28.200
I'll be in touch.

409
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.200
Everyone gets old.

410
00:36:30.966 --> 00:36:33.733
and you should take it easy now.

411
00:36:37.233 --> 00:36:38.866
DR. CHANG

412
00:36:43.866 --> 00:36:46.451
<i>The person you are calling
is currently unavailable...</i>

413
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.366
Sir. she's still not picking up.

414
00:36:58.066 --> 00:36:58.883
Let's go back.

415
00:36:58.966 --> 00:37:00.583
No. we'll finish the job.

416
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.566
What if something's wrong?

417
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:04.325
Nobody's answered at home all day.

418
00:37:46.066 --> 00:37:48.333
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

419
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:09.250
I told you. no excuses are allowed
at the edge of your knife.

420
00:38:09.333 --> 00:38:10.883
-No matter who you face.
-No matter who you face.

421
00:38:10.966 --> 00:38:14.033
See what happens when you open up
to other people's stories?

422
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.466
Remember.

423
00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:20.066
Don't shoot a butterfly with a gun.

424
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.533
What the hell?

425
00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.333
Let's go now.

426
00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.300
Don't move. I barely patched it...

427
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.733
What are you up to?

428
00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:10.500
I heard a screech

429
00:40:11.666 --> 00:40:13.733
and noticed a car on the side of the road.

430
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.366
I peeked in and found you there.

431
00:40:17.533 --> 00:40:21.466
You refused to go to the hospital.
then passed out.

432
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.417
It's an 8-cm lacerated wound.
including a cut to your right lat.

433
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.733
It barely missed your organs.
which is why you survived.

434
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:35.583
Forgive me for cutting your clothes off.
They were drenched in blood.

435
00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.566
Where's my stuff?

436
00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:39.400
I kept them safe.

437
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.241
You shouldn't do this.
You already bled too much.

438
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.050
Oh my.

439
00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:50.033
Bear with me.

440
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:17.900
What happened today...

441
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.633
Everyone has their own story.

442
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.133
Put this on before the nurses arrive.

443
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.166
I'll pack you some meds.

444
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.733
You're late.

445
00:42:25.866 --> 00:42:27.566
You sent a backup.

446
00:42:30.566 --> 00:42:31.566
Why?

447
00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:33.733
You don't trust me?

448
00:42:35.633 --> 00:42:37.333
The tide is high.

449
00:42:38.166 --> 00:42:40.400
and I can't have you swept away.

450
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.700
You're a great asset to this agency.

451
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.233
Why is this knife so dull?

452
00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:59.666
It may look dull...

453
00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:09.166
but it's still plenty useful.

454
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.133
Right.

455
00:43:14.066 --> 00:43:15.550
By the looks of it.

456
00:43:15.633 --> 00:43:19.866
you picked up random strays
and gave them all kinds of jobs.

457
00:43:19.966 --> 00:43:23.866
But our job is sacred.
eradicating malignant vermin.

458
00:43:24.466 --> 00:43:27.050
For instance.
pest-controlling those druggies

459
00:43:27.133 --> 00:43:30.566
who scammed a naive kid
and drove her to her death.

460
00:43:30.666 --> 00:43:34.500
The jobs you've been rejecting
are what we're supposed to be doing.

461
00:43:37.466 --> 00:43:39.383
Jeez. you're so frustrating.

462
00:43:39.466 --> 00:43:42.217
Those druggies
are pretty much like the mafia.

463
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.417
One bite and we're dead.
like eating toxins in a blow fish.

464
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.833
What do you want me to do?

465
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.550
How convenient. cherry-picking jobs.

466
00:43:49.633 --> 00:43:50.733
It's my authority.

467
00:43:50.833 --> 00:43:52.784
And authority comes with responsibility.

468
00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:54.866
Then try it yourself!

469
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:56.333
Sure. why not?

470
00:44:02.966 --> 00:44:04.250
And about Bullfight.

471
00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:07.866
he has a clean background
with great skills.

472
00:44:08.966 --> 00:44:11.417
Accept him as one of us
and cook him a meal sometime.

473
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.300
Your father
looks so young in that picture.

474
00:44:15.033 --> 00:44:17.166
Were you in diapers then?

475
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.566
Right!

476
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:22.533
You were in your prime too!

477
00:44:34.466 --> 00:44:36.733
What's the rush? Hang around a bit more.

478
00:44:41.066 --> 00:44:42.725
Why don't you grow out your nails?

479
00:44:44.466 --> 00:44:45.300
What?

480
00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:49.400
They used to be fancy. Try painting them.

481
00:44:51.366 --> 00:44:52.400
Why?

482
00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:55.900
You want me to rip off your face?

483
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.866
You have something to do before that. no?

484
00:45:05.866 --> 00:45:08.466
<i>You got your wounds treated like a dog.</i>

485
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.300
<i>Which means.</i>

486
00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:13.300
<i>you left a witness.</i>

487
00:45:14.966 --> 00:45:18.166
If the agency knew.
wouldn't you end up like Gadget?

488
00:45:22.966 --> 00:45:25.133
Now I see who you are.

489
00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:29.083
You do?

490
00:45:29.166 --> 00:45:30.233
Me?

491
00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:31.300
I do.

492
00:45:32.966 --> 00:45:34.533
A brat with a death wish.

493
00:45:39.233 --> 00:45:40.250
Right.

494
00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:44.333
You may be past your prime.
but I heard whoever crosses you is dead.

495
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.500
I know many specialists look up to you.

496
00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:52.566
Then stay out of my sight. okay?

497
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:54.066
If you wish to live long.

498
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.700
<i>Watch who you hire.</i>

499
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.033
That would be my business. Godmother.

500
00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:16.717
Do you want to die. you crazy bastard?

501
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.000
If not for money or justice.
then why are you here?

502
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.466
For the legend.

503
00:46:28.033 --> 00:46:29.583
You came to the right place.

504
00:46:29.666 --> 00:46:31.366
I like the look in your eyes.

Yes. sir!

523

Right back at you. Daddy.

524
00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:31.233
All right. see you later.

I WANT THE TRUTH AND AN APOLOGY

IN THE HOSPITAL DURING HER SURGERY

527
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.050
Hey. get rid of that!

528
00:49:54.133 --> 00:49:55.417
-Yes. ma'am.
-Apologize.

529
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.383
What are you talking about?

530
00:49:56.466 --> 00:49:58.750
-Apologize!
-You should know better!

531
00:49:58.833 --> 00:50:00.900
Seriously. stop it!

532
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.533
Apologize!

Hello.

535
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.233
Hi.

536
00:50:15.466 --> 00:50:17.666
ORANGES. WATERMELON. PEACHES

537
00:50:19.866 --> 00:50:22.300
Oh my. welcome!

538
00:50:24.166 --> 00:50:27.883
These peaches are in season.
They're as sweet as sugar.

539
00:50:27.966 --> 00:50:30.200
-I'll take some. then.
-How many?

540
00:50:31.366 --> 00:50:32.717
Is four enough?

541
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800
That's a lot.

542
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.700
You'll eat them all in no time.

543
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.417
Quite good for a seven-year-old. right?

544
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:42.733
Thanks.

545
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.717
Her mom is an angel?

546
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.633
Yes. because she's in heaven.

547
00:50:49.566 --> 00:50:50.400
What happened?

548
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.200
Her surgery went wrong.

549
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.750
so she spent five years on a sickbed
and then left us.

550
00:50:56.833 --> 00:51:00.033
Since then.
my son-in-law can't sleep at night.

551
00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:02.700
That's why he always takes night shifts.

552
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.250
And he's been protesting alone for years.

553
00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:08.233
which is meaningless.

554
00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:12.566
He says he does it to honor the deceased.

555
00:51:14.366 --> 00:51:16.566
Goodness me. I talked too much.

556
00:51:19.533 --> 00:51:22.033
Take this too. a bruised one.

557
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:25.550
People don't buy these
because they're blemished.

558
00:51:25.633 --> 00:51:27.866
but they actually taste better.

559
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.033
Thank you.

560
00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:31.533
Please come again.

561
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.750
Look. Hae-ni.

562
00:51:36.833 --> 00:51:38.900
Your dad is here.

563
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:39.833
Hae-ni.

564
00:51:40.733 --> 00:51:42.233
Daddy!

565
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:43.966
Why are you so late?

566
00:51:44.533 --> 00:51:46.200
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

567
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.466
-I missed you.
-Hold on. Hae-ni.

568
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.000
Ma'am!

569
00:53:43.833 --> 00:53:44.666
<i>Ma'am!</i>

570
00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.866
Why did you come?

571
00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:06.033
My family has nothing to do with anything.

572
00:54:06.866 --> 00:54:07.866
Why?

573
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.400
What?

574
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.500
You saw what I carry around.

575
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.800
But you're a good person.

576
00:54:18.166 --> 00:54:19.500
You saved a stray dog.

577
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.633
I'm not a good person.

578
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.866
Only good people can say that.

579
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.300
How's Braveheart?

580
00:54:33.466 --> 00:54:34.300
Braveheart?

581
00:54:36.133 --> 00:54:39.200
She seemed brave. so I...

582
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.900
You're bad at giving names.

583
00:54:46.133 --> 00:54:47.840
Why don't you want to see a doctor?

584
00:54:49.566 --> 00:54:51.366
My company might lay me off.

585
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.976
It must be a scary place
if you're worried about such a thing.

586
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.000
Then stop by my office
if your wound worsens.

587
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.437
And take Braveheart out for a walk
from time to time.

588
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.417
I don't know what to call you.

589
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.900
Could you tell me your name?

590
00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.900
Do you think I'm a good person too?

591
00:55:58.166 --> 00:55:59.133
Braveheart.

592
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.133
Okay. you're Braveheart from now on.

593
00:56:10.733 --> 00:56:14.033
This building has stood
for 40 years on this costly land.

594
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.583
It'd be great to demolish it
and build something new.

595
00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:19.500
Not as easy as it sounds?

596
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.966
This gimp was born as prey.

597
00:56:24.533 --> 00:56:27.883
and an old lioness is blocking its way.

598
00:56:27.966 --> 00:56:30.066
I think her claws have fallen out.

599
00:56:30.966 --> 00:56:33.750
She's never made any mistakes?

600
00:56:33.833 --> 00:56:36.417
She was perfect. Unbelievably so.

601
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.250
A living legend.
who fascinated and terrified us.

602
00:56:40.333 --> 00:56:43.833
They were all captivated by that story.

603
00:56:45.133 --> 00:56:47.366
Jeez. what happened?

604
00:56:48.533 --> 00:56:52.217
There was this guy. Ryu.
who built this place.

605
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.733
You prick...

606
00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:56.033
<i>I was late because of the prayer ritual.</i>

607
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.633
To make sure that my family

608
00:56:59.333 --> 00:57:00.700
<i>goes to heaven.</i>

609
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.233
When he died.

610
00:57:13.333 --> 00:57:18.733
Godmother wiped out 28 men
all by herself for revenge.

611
00:57:21.566 --> 00:57:22.833
<i>She sure did.</i>

612
00:57:30.966 --> 00:57:31.883
<i>Then she changed her name</i>

613
00:57:31.966 --> 00:57:34.733
from "Nails" to "Hornclaw."

614
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.033
But that was ages ago.

615
00:57:45.966 --> 00:57:48.833
Expired waste should be disposed of.
don't you think?

616
00:58:03.166 --> 00:58:04.000
Hello. ma'am.

617
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.233
Hello. Granny.

618
00:58:06.866 --> 00:58:08.050
Oh. hi.

619
00:58:08.133 --> 00:58:10.133
-On a walk with Braveheart?
-Yes.

620
00:58:11.133 --> 00:58:12.700
Can I play with her?

621
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.750
-Yes.
-Hae-ni.

622
00:58:13.833 --> 00:58:14.900
Sure.

623
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:16.500
Here you go.

624
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.250
Let's go. Braveheart.

625
00:58:18.333 --> 00:58:19.383
Hae-ni. don't go too far.

626
00:58:19.466 --> 00:58:20.733
Okay.

627
00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:26.800
Your girl seems smart.

628
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.200
She's a lot like her mom.

629
00:58:33.566 --> 00:58:35.466
My mother-in-law told you. right?

630
00:58:38.133 --> 00:58:40.133
She was fine. and then suddenly...

631
00:58:42.366 --> 00:58:44.033
The head of that hospital said.

632
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.750
"Everyone who's after money

633
00:58:46.833 --> 00:58:49.866
always starts
by asking for a heartfelt apology."

634
00:58:52.566 --> 00:58:53.500
Back then.

635
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.733
I wanted to end it all.

636
00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.566
Or actually. I wanted to...

637
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.533
Kill her?

638
00:59:14.133 --> 00:59:17.133
Would you eat with us?
We're on our way to lunch.

639
00:59:20.033 --> 00:59:21.400
No. I'll just...

640
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.900
You're back.

641
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.133
Come with us.
We all need to eat. you know.

642
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.500
Sorry. but I should just go.

643
00:59:31.466 --> 00:59:33.717
Pretty please.

644
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.633
Come with us.

645
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.900
I have a recital next week.

646
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:39.976
You should come too.

647
00:59:41.166 --> 00:59:44.200
Sorry. but I can't go to places like this.

648
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.566
But I practiced my dance really hard.

649
00:59:47.666 --> 00:59:49.700
Hae-ni. what's with you today?

650
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.133
Please don't mind her.

651
00:59:51.566 --> 00:59:52.700
Eat up.

652
00:59:56.733 --> 00:59:57.733
Hornclaw.

653
00:59:59.233 --> 01:00:00.133
What?

654
01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.133
My name.

655
01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:06.866
One claw. two claws. three claws.

656
01:00:06.966 --> 01:00:08.633
-four claws...
-Hae-ni.

657
01:00:11.533 --> 01:00:13.733
It means the claws of a beast.

658
01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:15.900
Is that so?

659
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.717
-I didn't know.
-Look over here!

660
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.700
Don't do that without permission. Hae-ni.

661
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.666
See? Looks good. right?

662
01:00:23.466 --> 01:00:24.917
Give me your number. I'll send it to you.

663
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.333
Hae-ni.

664
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.866
Sorry about that.

665
01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:35.917
Oh my gosh. Daddy. look.

666
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.083
Someone broke that and ran away.

667
01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:40.066
Isn't that expensive?

668
01:00:50.633 --> 01:00:51.700
Hello.

669
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.750
How can I help you?

670
01:00:54.833 --> 01:00:57.733
DR. KANG BONG-HWE. VETERINARIAN

671
01:00:59.566 --> 01:01:01.133
There's this old hound...

672
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.033
An old woman I know.

673
01:01:05.733 --> 01:01:07.538
She's been acting strange these days.

674
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.900
Why is that?

675
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.633
Sorry?

676
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.033
She's shaken by trivial things.

677
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.633
gets scared often.

678
01:01:32.566 --> 01:01:34.566
or craves food she never liked.

679
01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:37.642
You'll have to visit somewhere else
for psychogenic illnesses.

680
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.083
This is a hospital. though.

681
01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:42.700
We only treat animals.

682
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.466
Aren't humans...

683
01:01:48.233 --> 01:01:49.133
animals too?

684
01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:52.583
They are. but I can't treat them.

685
01:01:52.666 --> 01:01:53.633
That's weird.

686
01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:56.633
Pretty sure I saw you treat people.

687
01:02:06.166 --> 01:02:07.366
Hello.

688
01:02:07.466 --> 01:02:08.400
Oh. hello.

689
01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:10.917
-She won't eat anything.
-Oh no.

690
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.250
It must've been tough. Come inside.

691
01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:13.250
Okay.

692
01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.500
I'm sorry. sir.

693
01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:31.900
Tell me all about your blind date.
I'm dying to know.

694
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.717
-Hello!
-Come on in.

695
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.200
You two look gorgeous today.

696
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.533
Granny. do you want your nails done?

697
01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:41.550
Don't just stand there. come on in.

698
01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.066
No. I'm fine.

699
01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:44.833
And I'm not your granny.

700
01:02:48.066 --> 01:02:50.583
I want some strawberries.

701
01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:53.166
Strawberries are out of season.

702
01:02:54.966 --> 01:02:56.750
What about Jeju oranges?

703
01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:59.250
These California oranges are sweeter.

704
01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:00.733
Come on. that can't be.

705
01:03:00.833 --> 01:03:01.866
Sir. look.

706
01:03:01.966 --> 01:03:04.366
Come to my recital next week.

707
01:03:04.466 --> 01:03:06.417
Sorry. I'm too busy.

708
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.917
Come on. I practiced my dance so hard.

709
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.566
Really? Can you show me?

710
01:03:17.733 --> 01:03:20.200
-So good. sweetie.
-Wow. you're so good.

711
01:03:25.833 --> 01:03:28.400
That fruit shop owner
sure is good at her game.

712
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.200
What are you up to?

713
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:34.033
This is old. wrinkled. and bruised.
but she said it tastes the same.

714
01:03:34.666 --> 01:03:36.583
She said people only buy
the pretty and fresh ones

715
01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.366
because they don't know.

716
01:03:40.166 --> 01:03:44.633
If you ever lay hands
on Dr. Kang's family...

717
01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:49.133
You're serious. huh?

718
01:03:53.033 --> 01:03:54.966
That nerd must be a real charmer.

719
01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.566
melting even your ice-cold heart.

720
01:04:00.733 --> 01:04:02.633
I'll leave. so stop it.

721
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.583
What?

722
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:08.233
If I leave. there will be no threat
to Sinseong Agency.

723
01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.000
and that innocent man will be safe.

724
01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:15.700
I don't like that.

725
01:04:16.533 --> 01:04:21.366
You'll lay down your knife and retire
all because of him?

726
01:04:23.133 --> 01:04:24.533
Now that you're old.

727
01:04:24.633 --> 01:04:28.033
did feelings invade your body
like germs through your chapped skin?

728
01:04:28.133 --> 01:04:32.333
Are you drowning in pity. guilt.
protectiveness. or some shit?

729
01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:37.366
What is your goal here?

730
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.166
My goal?

731
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.733
People are funny.

732
01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:51.700
Even when they're lost.
they ask where others are going.

733
01:04:54.366 --> 01:04:56.400
Do you even know where you're headed?

734
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.733
Well...

735
01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.366
Age doesn't matter.

736
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.233
You can look all you like.

737
01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:13.633
But you don't deserve him.

738
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.833
See this?

739
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.554
Who would pay the same money for this?

740
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.066
Get some rest.

741
01:06:25.066 --> 01:06:26.033
I'm fine.

742
01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:32.633
I'll get you a new ID and a ticket.

743
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.666
No need.

744
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.400
I'll stay where I want to.

745
01:06:40.033 --> 01:06:41.333
Do as you wish.

746
01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:45.883
But from now on.

747
01:06:45.966 --> 01:06:47.333
you and I both...

748
01:06:49.033 --> 01:06:51.466
will make sure to never have
anything to protect.

749
01:07:22.233 --> 01:07:23.666
It's been ten years already.

750
01:07:24.466 --> 01:07:25.300
Great work.

751
01:07:29.866 --> 01:07:31.900
<i>Protect Sinseong Agency with that.</i>

752
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.550
I WANT THE TRUTH AND AN APOLOGY
FOR THE SUDDEN DEATH OF MY WIFE

753
01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:04.166
IN THE HOSPITAL DURING HER SURGERY

754
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.533
Hey. watch it!

755
01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:10.000
I have the worst luck today.

756
01:08:12.466 --> 01:08:16.033
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

757
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.366
What's wrong. ma'am?

758
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.233
PEST CONTROL TARGET

759
01:08:47.733 --> 01:08:49.733
CRUSH SKULL IN FRONT OF CHILD

760
01:08:53.866 --> 01:08:57.583
Guess this is a serious grudge.
In front of his child?

761
01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:58.633
Can't say.

762
01:08:59.366 --> 01:09:02.866
The client wants full confidentiality.
so I can't tell you much.

763
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.533
Why not give it to your loyal Bullfight?

764
01:09:11.033 --> 01:09:13.917
Client requested a female specialist
of similar age to the victim.

765
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.066
which is why I'm asking you in person.

766
01:09:16.833 --> 01:09:19.566
Rather than have someone else
make a mess of it.

767
01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:22.133
I'd rather you handle this cleanly.

768
01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:38.966
What the...

769
01:09:46.733 --> 01:09:47.966
Who's the client?

770
01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:51.700
Oh. Godmother...

771
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.733
Why are you doing this to me?

772
01:09:59.066 --> 01:10:01.200
Why is Dr. Kang being targeted?

773
01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:05.000
"Ask questions.
and you'll be killed on the spot."

774
01:10:05.733 --> 01:10:07.500
You made that rule.

775
01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:15.626
I didn't make that rule
just to catch some fish.

776
01:10:16.466 --> 01:10:17.966
It was to take the ocean.

777
01:10:22.033 --> 01:10:25.033
You don't even know
which way the ship is sailing!

778
01:10:28.133 --> 01:10:31.700
<i>The son of the hospital head
said that Dr. Kang killed his mom.</i>

779
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.166
<i>So he's out for revenge.</i>

780
01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:35.717
<i>And he dropped a fortune on it.</i>

781
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.366
Dr. Kang is not that kind of person.

782
01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:40.533
It did seem strange.

783
01:10:40.633 --> 01:10:43.609
The so-called son of a hospital head
was wearing a fake watch.

784
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.900
<i>Sohn said to take it anyway.
Money's money.</i>

785
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.500
But just in case...

786
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.133
I did some digging.

787
01:10:55.233 --> 01:10:57.250
Ten million?
Raising it to a hundred million. fucker.

788
01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.666
Let's see how big your guts are.

789
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.383
Fuck. you in or out?
I'm all in. you bastard.

790
01:11:05.466 --> 01:11:09.800
That fucking son of a bitch...

791
01:11:13.133 --> 01:11:14.966
Who the hell are you? Hey!

792
01:11:16.966 --> 01:11:19.633
Why did you put a hit on Kang Bong-hwe?

793
01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:21.666
Who?

794
01:11:24.733 --> 01:11:26.750
I don't know anything. really!

795
01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:28.566
I was paid. I just followed orders.

796
01:11:28.666 --> 01:11:29.500
By whom?

797
01:11:30.066 --> 01:11:31.717
On the phone...

798
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.583
We talked on the phone.

799
01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:35.566
My phone's in my back pocket.

800
01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.633
-Call him.
-Yes. ma'am.

801
01:11:42.066 --> 01:11:43.050
<i>What's up?</i>

802
01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:45.750
There's a lady here...

803
01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:46.733
<i>Granny.</i>

804
01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:50.400
I don't think you have time
to fool around with that loser.

805
01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:53.066
What do you want?

806
01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:54.200
<i>Equal ruin?</i>

807
01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:58.250
Dr. Kang's shift ends soon.

808
01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:00.500
<i>Want me to help you again?</i>

809
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.533
Wait. hold up!

810
01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:36.366
Thank you.

811
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.366
Are you okay?

812
01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:18.566
-Hey. watch it.
-Sorry.

813
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.366
Sir!

814
01:13:35.466 --> 01:13:37.533
No... Sir!

815
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.233
Please don't leave me here by myself!

816
01:14:20.066 --> 01:14:21.300
I'm sorry...

817
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.171
What are you doing here?

818
01:14:34.233 --> 01:14:35.900
-I'm so relieved.
-Pardon?

819
01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.750
PLEASE ENJOY.
FROM BRAVEHEART'S MOM

820
01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:49.733
You don't need to worry about us.

821
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.200
No. it's...

822
01:15:00.566 --> 01:15:01.400
Wait.

823
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.700
Is there anything

824
01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:08.333
you want to say to me?

825
01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:14.233
You've lost weight.

826
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.866
Be sure not to skip meals.

827
01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:32.066
So. is your heart racing?

828
01:15:35.466 --> 01:15:37.533
Why make this so complicated?

829
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.366
There's no point

830
01:15:40.066 --> 01:15:42.310
if you can't figure out
the reason on your own.

831
01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.966
You should go rub him out.
Why waste time with me?

832
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.466
I wonder why.

833
01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.466
Maybe I wanted to see the legend.

834
01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:57.083
You must be disappointed.

835
01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:58.666
I am.

836
01:15:59.533 --> 01:16:00.566
In myself.

837
01:16:02.566 --> 01:16:05.383
For spending my whole life
searching for such crap.

838
01:16:05.466 --> 01:16:06.400
Stop this.

839
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.300
If you mean me. you already found me.

840
01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:13.233
No.

841
01:16:16.033 --> 01:16:17.866
I haven't found it yet.

842
01:16:17.966 --> 01:16:19.866
This isn't the real fight.

843
01:16:19.966 --> 01:16:21.583
Don't even think of retiring.

844
01:16:21.666 --> 01:16:24.733
And also. you'll never beat me.

845
01:16:26.566 --> 01:16:28.166
You've got something to protect.

846
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.966
while I've got nothing to lose.

847
01:16:33.133 --> 01:16:34.400
Welcome.

848
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.550
This place is so nice.

849
01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:36.733
Shall we sit here?

850
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.533
I can't wait any longer.

851
01:17:05.866 --> 01:17:07.500
A daughter... No.

852
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.333
Two sons... No.

853
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.366
1998. 1999.

854
01:17:19.066 --> 01:17:20.333
No...

855
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.733
BAE JONG-SUN
ONE SON

856
01:17:37.133 --> 01:17:38.966
I'm your new housekeeper...

857
01:17:44.733 --> 01:17:45.733
Hi there.

858
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.866
Allergic to pollen...

859
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.166
SON CAN'T SWALLOW PILLS. GRIND INTO POWDER

860
01:18:06.033 --> 01:18:07.033
Give me some water.

861
01:18:07.966 --> 01:18:09.700
Will you eat?

862
01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:11.333
No.

863
01:18:15.966 --> 01:18:17.566
<i>When does your dad get home?</i>

864
01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:19.050
After midnight.

865
01:18:19.133 --> 01:18:20.733
Or sometimes not at all.

866
01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:38.222
How long have you been working here?

867
01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:40.000
Ten days?

868
01:18:42.233 --> 01:18:43.366
Work's not too hard?

869
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.200
Goddammit.

870
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.066
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

871
01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.233
Jeez. seriously?

872
01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:02.066
Who the heck untied these shoelaces?

873
01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:15.723
BLOW TO OCCIPITAL AND PARIETAL BONE.
CRUSHED SKULL

874
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.133
So he's aiming for the back of my head.

875
01:19:44.633 --> 01:19:45.700
Listen carefully.

876
01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.666
If I don't come back.
you leave through there.

877
01:19:49.666 --> 01:19:52.366
Don't starve like a fool waiting for me.

878
01:19:53.166 --> 01:19:55.733
Find a new owner
or rummage through the bins.

879
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.561
Do whatever it takes to survive.

880
01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:09.566
Just don't let the dog catcher get you.

881
01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.533
<i>You're going to hit Han Seong-do's den?</i>

882
01:20:20.633 --> 01:20:23.583
I'm going to do a job
worthy of Sinseong Agency.

883
01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:26.083
Killing pests and saving people in pain.

884
01:20:26.166 --> 01:20:27.883
<i>Madam Hong's case</i>

885
01:20:27.966 --> 01:20:31.033
<i>is not as simple
as getting rid of one druggie.</i>

886
01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.033
Just rub out that vet and be done with it.

887
01:20:35.133 --> 01:20:38.466
Why poke at such a big wasp nest?

888
01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:42.300
It'll be war if you screw up there.

889
01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.550
You may be the Godmother.
but you can't do that job alone.

890
01:20:47.633 --> 01:20:49.550
<i>This will be my last job.</i>

891
01:20:49.633 --> 01:20:51.583
<i>I'll disappear whether I survive or not.</i>

892
01:20:51.666 --> 01:20:53.520
So you can run this place from now on.

893
01:20:54.866 --> 01:20:57.717
If you're that worried. send a backup.

894
01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.533
That guy. Bullfight.

895
01:21:02.366 --> 01:21:05.966
This is so sudden.
What am I supposed to say?

896
01:21:23.366 --> 01:21:25.966
Come on. get ahold of yourself.

897
01:21:26.533 --> 01:21:27.383
Bon appétit!

898
01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.666
Thank you for the food!

899
01:21:33.233 --> 01:21:34.366
What the hell?

900
01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:38.417
Are you happy living off
of others' blood and tears?

901
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.217
An old hag?

902
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.466
What bastard hired a hag like you?

903
01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.700
Who was it?

904
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.633
Oh Gwang-ryul? Jeon In-deuk?

905
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.866
Surely not Madam Hong?

906
01:22:00.633 --> 01:22:03.133
It doesn't matter who kills you.

907
01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.000
What matters is why you're dying.

908
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.533
Boss!

909
01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:18.750
Hey!

910
01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:21.166
Prepare this old hag's funeral!

911
01:22:24.733 --> 01:22:25.566
<i>Godmother!</i>

912
01:22:28.233 --> 01:22:29.700
You can't do this.

913
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.700
I know you're the Godmother.
but it's too dangerous.

914
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.900
You'll die there!

915
01:22:38.633 --> 01:22:40.133
Do as you fucking wish.

916
01:22:49.566 --> 01:22:51.466
Hey! Get her!

917
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.366
Get her!

918
01:23:03.966 --> 01:23:05.033
Hurry. find her!

919
01:23:06.866 --> 01:23:08.281
-What the...
-What the heck?

920
01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:09.666
Hurry up!

921
01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:29.400
Where's Bullfight?

922
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.700
What about him?

923
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.050
Where is he right now?

924
01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:36.200
Why the hell would I send our next ace
into that death trap?

925
01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:40.366
<i>And Godmother.
everyone has their own quota of goodwill.</i>

926
01:23:40.466 --> 01:23:43.733
<i>You're letting Dr. Kang live
because of something personal. right?</i>

927
01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:46.800
<i>And that's why you want to quit.</i>

928
01:23:48.866 --> 01:23:51.133
You've lived too long. dear Godmother.

929
01:24:02.966 --> 01:24:03.800
You!

930
01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.250
I got her.

931
01:24:46.333 --> 01:24:47.406
In front of Room Four.

932
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.200
If you're so old. just die!
Why bother living?

933
01:24:58.366 --> 01:24:59.700
Look here. Mr. Sohn.

934
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:04.033
This is so out of line.
How much have you earned from me?

935
01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:06.250
<i>How dare you fucking trash
my business like this?</i>

936
01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:08.466
You've deserved to die several times over.

937
01:25:09.366 --> 01:25:11.733
Why complain in the face of such luck?

938
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.168
Let's meet to negotiate...

939
01:25:14.633 --> 01:25:15.900
What the fuck?

940
01:25:25.733 --> 01:25:28.166
So. are you going to apologize?

941
01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:34.900
I'm tired. Let's just end this.

942
01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.333
You disgusting vermin.

943
01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.073
Snack on these on your way to hell.

944
01:25:42.833 --> 01:25:45.233
Little worms. it's time to eat!

945
01:26:08.833 --> 01:26:11.066
Pour it in every corner.

946
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.217
Have fun!

947
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.166
Goodbye. Granny.

948
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.133
-Hurry up. guys!
-Yes. sir!

949
01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:46.566
Hey! Stop him!

950
01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:48.366
I said stop. you prick!

951
01:26:49.066 --> 01:26:49.966
Hey!

952
01:26:58.566 --> 01:26:59.883
You're not done yet. right?

953
01:27:00.533 --> 01:27:02.633
What? Are you her son?

954
01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.300
Well. from the same family.

955
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.533
You son of a...

956
01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:41.700
Where the heck is she?

957
01:27:42.666 --> 01:27:43.500
Where are you?

958
01:28:01.133 --> 01:28:02.466
Are you okay?

959
01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:04.200
Die!

960
01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:17.800
<i>Are you worried?</i>

961
01:28:19.366 --> 01:28:20.200
Yes.

962
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.900
Then assign Bullfight as backup.
Do it yourself.

963
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.666
Sohn won't do it.

964
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.200
If I assign him. will he go?

965
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.700
Just do as I tell you.

966
01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.824
I'll make you dinner.

967
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.083
In the condition you're in?

968
01:29:02.166 --> 01:29:04.500
I can still cook a meal for my colleague.

969
01:29:19.466 --> 01:29:20.866
Ordinary people...

970
01:29:21.666 --> 01:29:22.633
What?

971
01:29:23.366 --> 01:29:24.733
I guess ordinary people...

972
01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:28.733
must eat like this often.

973
01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.566
What made you start this work?

974
01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:34.666
To be useful.

975
01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.066
One time when I was young. I was so hungry

976
01:29:41.133 --> 01:29:43.231
that I ate
the neighbor's bell flower roots.

977
01:29:44.566 --> 01:29:46.517
But they turned out to be wild ginsengs.

978
01:29:47.233 --> 01:29:51.200
My family went broke paying it back.
and they kicked me out.

979
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.000
I worked as a maid

980
01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:59.566
<i>and kept getting beaten. abandoned.
and running away.</i>

981
01:29:59.666 --> 01:30:01.400
Everyone told me to go die.

982
01:30:02.533 --> 01:30:05.300
Calling me
the most useless bitch in the world.

983
01:30:08.633 --> 01:30:11.066
<i>And when I was 16.</i>

984
01:30:12.133 --> 01:30:14.279
I met someone who took me in
as their family.

985
01:30:15.033 --> 01:30:16.583
What's your name?

986
01:30:16.666 --> 01:30:18.417
Min Seol-hwa.

987
01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.866
What a pretty name.

988
01:30:19.966 --> 01:30:21.717
<i>He fed me.</i>

989
01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.917
<i>housed me. and gave me work.</i>

990
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.166
And he was the first person
to call me useful.

991
01:30:35.066 --> 01:30:36.366
Don't dodge it like that.

992
01:30:36.966 --> 01:30:38.083
Flash your reflexes like that.

993
01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.410
and you're basically screaming.
"I'm a killer."

994
01:30:41.066 --> 01:30:43.650
Hide it even if it means
getting your head bashed in. Got it?

995
01:30:43.733 --> 01:30:44.566
Yes.

996
01:30:44.666 --> 01:30:46.233
That's it for today.

997
01:30:48.833 --> 01:30:51.833
I believe this work is sacred.

998
01:30:52.366 --> 01:30:55.800
Each of us is saving the world.

999
01:30:56.666 --> 01:30:57.934
Even if no one else knows.

1000
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.733
I'm jealous.

1001
01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:08.566
I had that kind of person in my life once.

1002
01:31:09.233 --> 01:31:10.300
Very briefly.

1003
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.400
Tell me.

1004
01:31:13.833 --> 01:31:15.900
Do you remember when we first met?

1005
01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.200
Was it 25 years ago?

1006
01:31:22.066 --> 01:31:23.033
Hi there.

1007
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.500
I'm sorry. Do-young.

1008
01:31:56.066 --> 01:31:58.200
Wow. this is so touching.

1009
01:31:59.633 --> 01:32:00.733
Then...

1010
01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:04.166
you must know why I came for you.

1011
01:32:08.333 --> 01:32:10.772
You won't feel better
even if you kill me yourself.

1012
01:32:11.366 --> 01:32:15.050
So why be lame
and leave your ancient revenge to others?

1013
01:32:15.133 --> 01:32:16.966
You should torment me to the end.

1014
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.466
If you just drink up
whatever's given to you.

1015
01:32:31.966 --> 01:32:33.166
you'll end up dead.

1016
01:32:33.966 --> 01:32:35.900
Especially from a colleague you trust.

1017
01:32:42.633 --> 01:32:43.700
You failed...

1018
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.583
You failed on purpose?

1019
01:32:47.666 --> 01:32:49.900
Knowing I'd come?

1020
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:50.833
Fifty-fifty.

1021
01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.566
But I knew you would find me.

1022
01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:56.233
That's why

1023
01:32:56.333 --> 01:32:57.400
you made...

1024
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.800
such a mess.

1025
01:33:20.566 --> 01:33:22.833
Think of it as being clawed by a beast.

1026
01:33:23.533 --> 01:33:24.500
See you in hell.

1027
01:34:03.166 --> 01:34:06.066
Your precious ace is history.

1028
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.700
I shouldn't have accepted you here.

1029
01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.333
When did you ever accept me?

1030
01:34:19.733 --> 01:34:21.000
It was for us...

1031
01:34:25.066 --> 01:34:26.733
For Sinseong Agency!

1032
01:34:26.833 --> 01:34:29.533
I did all of that for us!

1033
01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.033
Sure. you did your best.

1034
01:34:35.233 --> 01:34:36.633
What do you think

1035
01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.266
your father would have done?

1036
01:34:49.566 --> 01:34:50.733
You'll do it. right?

1037
01:34:51.733 --> 01:34:53.343
All the work you couldn't finish?

1038
01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.166
Burn this place down.

1039
01:34:57.066 --> 01:34:58.188
And you leave here too.

1040
01:35:08.166 --> 01:35:09.000
Hae-ni!

1041
01:35:09.666 --> 01:35:10.966
Daddy's here!

1042
01:35:13.366 --> 01:35:15.333
Look how cute your daughter is!

1043
01:35:23.833 --> 01:35:25.133
Did you see me?

1044
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.566
Where is she?

1045
01:35:29.333 --> 01:35:30.250
Hello.

1046
01:35:30.333 --> 01:35:31.733
Hello. sir. ma'am.

1047
01:35:31.833 --> 01:35:33.333
Where's Hae-ni?

1048
01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.400
Hae-ni? She was the first one out.

1049
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.866
-Then I'll check the restroom.
-Okay.

1050
01:35:39.966 --> 01:35:41.700
I'll look inside a bit more.

1051
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.133
Hae-ni?

1052
01:35:43.633 --> 01:35:45.033
Hae-ni?

1053
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.233
-Hello.
-Hello.

1054
01:36:08.533 --> 01:36:09.566
Got you!

1055
01:36:13.066 --> 01:36:13.900
I'm sorry.

1056
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.233
You grabbed me so suddenly...

1057
01:36:16.333 --> 01:36:17.733
Haven't you gone too far?

1058
01:36:17.833 --> 01:36:19.300
She's just a little girl.

1059
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.133
What...

1060
01:36:25.033 --> 01:36:27.423
Will you still keep pretending
after reading this?

1061
01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:31.050
<i>I thought things over
at the gates of hell.</i>

1062
01:36:31.133 --> 01:36:33.000
<i>but I felt really bad for Hae-ni.</i>

1063
01:36:35.533 --> 01:36:37.923
<i>She'll most likely end up alone
just like we were.</i>

1064
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.300
<i>I know because I've been there.</i>

1065
01:36:41.233 --> 01:36:43.533
<i>I'd be breaking my rule.</i>

1066
01:36:43.633 --> 01:36:45.666
<i>but I'm so upset. I can't help it.</i>

1067
01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.233
<i>That's the problem with humans.</i>

1068
01:36:48.333 --> 01:36:51.700
<i>When you're feeling down.
everything goes out the window.</i>

1069
01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.400
<i>You understand. right?</i>

1070
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.533
<i>I'll throw the biggest party ever.</i>

1071
01:36:55.633 --> 01:36:57.366
<i>You come here alone.</i>

1072
01:36:57.466 --> 01:36:58.866
<i>To Happyland.</i>

1073
01:36:58.966 --> 01:37:01.400
Who the heck are you? What do you want?

1074
01:37:02.466 --> 01:37:03.734
You can't call the police.

1075
01:37:04.866 --> 01:37:05.900
I'll bring her back.

1076
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.293
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm reporting it right now.

1077
01:37:13.033 --> 01:37:14.133
Trust me.

1078
01:37:14.966 --> 01:37:16.333
Hae-ni will be safe.

1079
01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:19.200
It's me that he wants.

1080
01:37:30.966 --> 01:37:34.466
Please bring Hae-ni back. okay?

1081
01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.044
This is because
I saved you that day. isn't it?

1082
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.110
You weren't supposed to be saved.

1083
01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.300
but I saved you. didn't I?

1084
01:37:56.733 --> 01:37:59.666
Even so. I don't regret treating you.

1085
01:38:01.966 --> 01:38:03.866
It was something I had to do.

1086
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.966
Why isn't it moving?

1087
01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.166
Hi!

1088
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.133
Braveheart. remember what I told you?

1089
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:46.900
Braveheart...

1090
01:41:03.033 --> 01:41:04.033
<i>Approaching target.</i>

1091
01:41:04.633 --> 01:41:06.033
<i>Copy. No blind spots.</i>

1092
01:41:06.733 --> 01:41:07.566
<i>All clear.</i>

1093
01:41:21.133 --> 01:41:21.966
Third floor!

1094
01:41:32.366 --> 01:41:33.233
Spread out!

1095
01:41:33.333 --> 01:41:34.533
Target exposed! Fire!

1096
01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.417
<i>Team B. entering the third floor.</i>

1097
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.566
<i>Provide cover.</i>

1098
01:41:55.366 --> 01:41:57.466
-Just shoot!
<i>-Stairs on the third floor!</i>

1099
01:42:04.666 --> 01:42:06.366
Help me...

1100
01:42:07.966 --> 01:42:09.866
Help me...

1101
01:42:33.666 --> 01:42:34.983
Squeeze in from both sides!

1102
01:42:39.166 --> 01:42:40.000
Going in!

1103
01:42:40.733 --> 01:42:41.566
Come out!

1104
01:44:22.133 --> 01:44:25.233
No hurting children.
That's your rule. isn't it?

1105
01:44:25.333 --> 01:44:26.666
Don't kick her!

1106
01:44:29.033 --> 01:44:29.866
All right. then.

1107
01:44:39.666 --> 01:44:40.500
Drop your gun.

1108
01:44:49.966 --> 01:44:51.066
What took you so long?

1109
01:44:51.866 --> 01:44:53.666
I thought I'd die waiting.

1110
01:44:54.233 --> 01:44:56.866
So this is the farce that you prepared?

1111
01:45:00.233 --> 01:45:02.965
You worried my ancient revenge
would be lame. didn't you?

1112
01:45:04.066 --> 01:45:05.166
Sure.

1113
01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:08.917
these losers I'm working with
could do a lot better.

1114
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.917
You've got some nerve!

1115
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.917
-How dare you...
-Captain Lee.

1116
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.917
I paid you in full in advance.
Is there a problem?

1117
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.900
My guys are all dead
because of your stupid plan.

1118
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.233
Didn't you know
you were just human shields?

1119
01:45:20.833 --> 01:45:21.906
Say that again. you...

1120
01:45:28.366 --> 01:45:31.300
You crazy bitch.
you think you're still the Godmother?

1121
01:45:35.666 --> 01:45:36.700
Get the hell up!

1122
01:45:37.366 --> 01:45:38.200
Hey. get up!

1123
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.666
Get up!

1124
01:45:41.466 --> 01:45:42.300
Let go!

1125
01:45:48.233 --> 01:45:49.833
Shit!

1126
01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:55.466
I told you.
You shouldn't underestimate her.

1127
01:45:56.233 --> 01:45:58.866
I'll go up and pay you a generous fee.

1128
01:45:58.966 --> 01:45:59.917
Drive safe.

1129
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.200
You fuckers!

1130
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.566
Don't be so pathetic.

1131
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.233
I'll cut off her ear.

1132
01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.033
The rest. too!

1133
01:46:48.366 --> 01:46:50.383
What should I do for you to give her back?

1134
01:46:50.466 --> 01:46:51.717
Give her back?

1135
01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.000
Take her yourself.

1136
01:46:53.733 --> 01:46:56.700
Why do you keep bringing Dr. Kang
in between us?

1137
01:46:58.733 --> 01:47:01.066
That vet is someone to be protected.

1138
01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.333
and I'm trash to be cleaned up?

1139
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.833
It seems so.

1140
01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.215
Why are you doing this to me?

1141
01:47:21.233 --> 01:47:22.800
Then what about you?

1142
01:47:23.833 --> 01:47:25.533
Aren't you waste to dispose of?

1143
01:47:26.633 --> 01:47:28.700
Since you're old and useless.

1144
01:47:32.566 --> 01:47:35.966
Someone said.
even if you're old and useless.

1145
01:47:36.666 --> 01:47:38.466
you shouldn't be thrown away.

1146
01:47:43.133 --> 01:47:45.166
You can never protect him.

1147
01:47:46.166 --> 01:47:48.866
I'll kill him. And all his family.

1148
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:56.466
You'll protect them like that?

1149
01:48:05.133 --> 01:48:05.966
Granny...

1150
01:48:09.733 --> 01:48:10.900
Keep this up.

1151
01:48:12.033 --> 01:48:13.633
and I'll throw her off.

1152
01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:17.833
-No...
-You're all dead. bastards!

1153
01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.533
What now?

1154
01:48:28.633 --> 01:48:30.487
The winner will have to take your car.

1155
01:48:33.033 --> 01:48:34.366
You didn't learn right.

1156
01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.217
If you treat others like vermin.

1157
01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.000
you become useless vermin yourself.

1158
01:48:44.833 --> 01:48:47.566
Sorry. I was self-taught.

1159
01:48:50.666 --> 01:48:52.033
Can I kill you?

1160
01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:56.000
Sure. Weren't you going to?

1161
01:49:17.166 --> 01:49:18.500
Where are you looking?

1162
01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:30.900
What the... Is that it?

1163
01:49:37.366 --> 01:49:38.333
You don't want it?

1164
01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:46.533
When does your dad get home?

1165
01:49:46.633 --> 01:49:49.166
After midnight.

1166
01:49:49.733 --> 01:49:51.133
Or sometimes not at all.

1167
01:49:54.033 --> 01:49:56.300
You should get to bed now.

1168
01:49:57.366 --> 01:50:00.133
By the way.
what music are you listening to?

1169
01:50:01.566 --> 01:50:02.400
This?

1170
01:50:03.966 --> 01:50:05.366
Listen when things are hard.

1171
01:50:11.866 --> 01:50:15.400
No. this isn't it.

1172
01:50:20.833 --> 01:50:22.101
Are you giving this to me?

1173
01:50:34.966 --> 01:50:37.233
It doesn't seem fair to keep two.

1174
01:50:37.333 --> 01:50:38.333
Should I drop one?

1175
01:50:39.033 --> 01:50:40.066
Do what you want.

1176
01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:41.533
But you'll regret it.

1177
01:50:57.033 --> 01:50:58.666
I gave it back to you.

1178
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.033
Thanks for that.

1179
01:51:13.866 --> 01:51:15.033
Bae Do-young.

1180
01:51:15.133 --> 01:51:17.417
Didn't I tell you to come out and greet me

1181
01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:22.200
as soon as I return from work. you prick?

1182
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.550
Who do you take after to be so weak?

1183
01:51:25.633 --> 01:51:27.733
You damn idiot!

1184
01:51:27.833 --> 01:51:28.833
Sir.

1185
01:51:31.066 --> 01:51:32.466
What the heck?

1186
01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.800
You're a legend. Is this all you've got?

1187
01:52:08.466 --> 01:52:09.417
<i>This is the police.</i>

1188
01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:12.900
I've been kidnapped. Please call my dad.

1189
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.083
I'm Kang Hae-ni.

1190
01:52:14.166 --> 01:52:16.333
Please check my location
and come find me...

1191
01:52:38.566 --> 01:52:41.966
Remember. This is a seed that you planted.

1192
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.466
Unlike some people. I keep my promises.

1193
01:52:47.333 --> 01:52:48.533
"Promises"?

1194
01:52:50.566 --> 01:52:51.800
<i>Have a good day!</i>

1195
01:53:07.866 --> 01:53:09.233
Don't you get it yet?

1196
01:53:09.333 --> 01:53:10.500
So stupid!

1197
01:53:19.366 --> 01:53:20.833
Are you stalling for time?

1198
01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.133
For her?

1199
01:53:32.233 --> 01:53:33.566
For goodness' sake.

1200
01:53:35.233 --> 01:53:36.466
look at me.

1201
01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:41.133
Look at me!

1202
01:54:37.066 --> 01:54:38.500
Don't be too upset.

1203
01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.800
I'll be following you soon.

1204
01:54:41.966 --> 01:54:43.033
Finally...

1205
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.000
you're here.

1206
01:54:58.566 --> 01:55:00.566
This time. I won.

1207
01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:02.800
Because...

1208
01:55:03.866 --> 01:55:05.166
I'm the one...

1209
01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:08.733
leaving you behind.

1210
01:55:24.166 --> 01:55:25.400
Have a good day.

1211
01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.066
Take your medicine at lunch.

1212
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.700
Why were you good to me?

1213
01:55:37.366 --> 01:55:39.133
You didn't even...

1214
01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:43.333
recognize me.

1215
01:55:48.466 --> 01:55:49.550
Do-young. where are you going?

1216
01:55:49.633 --> 01:55:50.853
I forgot my indoor shoes!

1217
01:56:02.633 --> 01:56:05.733
You didn't see anything. Forget all this.

1218
01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.800
Can I come with you?

1219
01:56:10.366 --> 01:56:12.833
Later. when you grow up.

1220
01:56:23.033 --> 01:56:23.866
I'll...

1221
01:56:23.966 --> 01:56:25.733
...come find you.

1222
01:56:30.566 --> 01:56:31.566
For sure!

1223
01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.366
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1224
01:56:52.833 --> 01:56:54.233
I was scared.

1225
01:56:56.133 --> 01:56:57.500
What if...

1226
01:57:00.466 --> 01:57:01.733
you forgot about me?

1227
01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:22.566
Now you remember?

1228
01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:24.866
Yes.

1229
01:57:30.166 --> 01:57:31.166
How?

1230
01:57:31.733 --> 01:57:34.050
When it's your time to die.

1231
01:57:34.133 --> 01:57:37.500
your whole life flashes before your eyes.

1232
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.583
I promise.

1233
01:57:40.666 --> 01:57:43.400
One day. you'll be much stronger
than your dad.

1234
01:57:45.033 --> 01:57:47.633
Until then. hold tight to your grudge.

1235
01:57:49.133 --> 01:57:50.466
For today. sleep well.

1236
01:57:52.233 --> 01:57:53.566
Tomorrow will be better.

1237
01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:56.866
Can we...

1238
01:57:57.866 --> 01:57:59.233
What?

1239
01:57:59.333 --> 01:58:01.083
...go to Happyland together?

1240
01:58:01.166 --> 01:58:02.566
Happyland?

1241
01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:05.200
The amusement park.

1242
01:58:05.966 --> 01:58:08.533
My friends all bragged about going.

1243
01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.366
Can we go?

1244
01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.633
Shall we?

1245
01:58:25.133 --> 01:58:26.566
Liar.

1246
01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.666
You never answered.

1247
01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.300
I guess it's not...

1248
01:58:38.033 --> 01:58:39.533
your time to go...

1249
01:58:41.566 --> 01:58:43.166
yet...

1250
01:58:49.466 --> 01:58:50.466
Can you

1251
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:53.800
swallow your pills now?

1252
01:59:19.166 --> 01:59:21.133
Now your left hand. ma'am?

1253
01:59:22.533 --> 01:59:23.366
Oh my!

1254
01:59:25.033 --> 01:59:26.233
I'm sorry.

1255
01:59:26.333 --> 01:59:28.083
It's just that
I've never seen a prosthetic hand.

1256
01:59:28.166 --> 01:59:30.733
Do what you want with it.
Any design is fine.

1257
01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:35.300
Yes. ma'am. I'll try my best.

1258
01:59:45.966 --> 01:59:47.566
<i>He's a new member of our family.</i>

1259
01:59:53.333 --> 01:59:57.566
I KNOW I DID SOMETHING BAD.
BUT I WAS MAD THAT YOU'D LEAVE ME AGAIN

1260
01:59:57.666 --> 01:59:59.550
STILL. I'M SURE
YOU'LL BE THE ONE TO SURVIVE

1261
01:59:59.633 --> 02:00:01.566
BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE TO PROTECT

1262
02:00:12.066 --> 02:00:12.900
<i>Ryu.</i>

1263
02:00:14.066 --> 02:00:17.400
<i>This didn't happen to you
because you had something to protect.</i>

1264
02:00:22.366 --> 02:00:23.233
<i>In the end.</i>

1265
02:00:24.233 --> 02:00:27.066
<i>we all break and fade away.</i>

1266
