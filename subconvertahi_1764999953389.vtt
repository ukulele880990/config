00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:42.813
Well. you could have...

189
00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.192
Forget it.

190
00:17:46.275 --> 00:17:49.027
When you see this one... [chuckles]

191
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:52.198
Let's just say... [inhales sharply]

192
00:17:52.281 --> 00:17:53.615
It's disturbing.

193
00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.494
And. uh. I hate to use a cliché.

194
00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.996
but you might want to sit down. Seriously.

195
00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:01.707
'Cause I am telling you
what you are about to witness...

196
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.584
Is this about them eating people?

197
00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:08.255
-What?
-It is troubling.

198
00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.800
Wait. how would you... How could you...

199
00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:13.802
Allow me.

200
00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.600
<i>Hello. Carol. We're John Cena.</i>

201
00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.353
<i>and we're here to address some questions
you may be having</i>

202
00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:23.854
<i>regarding our food supply.</i>

203
00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.608
<i>As you know.
we can't purposely kill. harm.</i>

204
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.277
<i>or otherwise interfere
with any form of life.</i>

205
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.155
<i>That limits what we're able to consume.</i>

206
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.951
<i>Because when we say "any life."
that includes plant life.</i>

207
00:18:37.034 --> 00:18:39.787
<i>We can't harvest wheat or corn or rice.</i>

208
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.788
<i>We can't pluck an apple from a tree.</i>

209
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.041
<i>Once an apple drops of its own accord.</i>

210
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.418
<i>well. we'll eat it. of course.
and gratefully.</i>

211
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:49.547
<i>Indeed. we harvest
all the windfall we can find.</i>

212
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.971
<i>Plus. there are billions
of domesticated animals.</i>

213
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:55.761
<i>cows. chief amongst them.
that still require milking.</i>

214
00:18:56.345 --> 00:18:59.598
<i>And there's preexisting food.
millions of tons of it.</i>

215
00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.767
<i>that was processed prior to our joining.</i>

216
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:03.936
<i>So far. so good. right?</i>

217
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:06.647
<i>Except for one small problem.</i>

218
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:14.154
<i>As of this taping.
there are 7.348.292.411 of us.</i>

219
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.657
<i>That's a lot of mouths to feed.</i>

220
00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:18.951
<i>We're facing a caloric deficit.</i>

221
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.231
<i>and to make up for it.
we've had to take certain measures.</i>

222
00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:26.041
<i>This is how we get our sustenance.</i>

223
00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:30.003
<i>One half-pint of this shelf-stable liquid
contains 300 calories.</i>

224
00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:33.924
<i>Which means that based on
a diet of 2.400 calories a day.</i>

225
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:38.345
<i>someone John Cena's size
needs eight of these every 24 hours.</i>

226
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:42.015
<i>Larger individuals require more.
Smaller ones. less.</i>

227
00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:43.893
<i>What's in it?</i>

228
00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:45.478
<i>Well. a lot of things.</i>

229
00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:47.354
<i>It's manufactured across the globe.</i>

230
00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:51.191
<i>so the recipe changes based on
the local availability of ingredients.</i>

231
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.862
<i>Mostly. it's those stockpiled
foodstuffs we spoke of.</i>

232
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:57.447
<i>particularly ones that
are in danger of spoiling.</i>

233
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.243
<i>Additionally. each carton
contains eight to 12%</i>

234
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.161
<i>of something we call HDP.</i>

235
00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.122
<i>Human-derived protein.</i>

236
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.583
<i>And yep.
that's pretty much what it sounds like.</i>

237
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:13.255
<i>Nearly 100.000 people pass away each day
due to natural causes and accidents.</i>

238
00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.925
<i>Those human remains.
which would otherwise go to waste.</i>

239
00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:17.843
<i>are our source of HDP.</i>

240
00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.431
<i>We cherish the memory of these people
and appreciate their sacrifice.</i>

241
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:26.101
<i>Given our druthers.
would we choose to consume HDP?</i>

242
00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:27.937
<i>No.</i>

243
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.648
<i>Throughout history. most cultures.
though not all.</i>

244
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:32.900
<i>have taken a dim view of anthropophagy.</i>

245
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.445
<i>Honestly. we're not
that keen on it ourselves.</i>

246
00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.864
<i>But we're left with little choice.</i>

247
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.618
<i>Rest assured. Carol. you will
never have to consume this product.</i>

248
00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:46.038
<i>Not unless you want to.
which we assume is unlikely.</i>

249
00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:50.126
<i>We will never serve HDP to you
in any form at any time.</i>

250
00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:52.378
<i>We will continue
to reserve only the freshest.</i>

251
00:20:52.461 --> 00:20:55.130
<i>best windfall
and stockpiled foods for you.</i>

252
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.758
<i>We hope that clears things up.</i>

253
00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:01.720
{\an8}<i>As always. your well-being is
of the utmost importance to us.</i>

254
00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:06.350
{\an8}<i>Any comments. concerns. call any
time. day or night. and leave a voicemail.</i>

255
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.603
<i>We regret not being able
to speak to you directly.</i>

256
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:12.189
<i>but for the time being. we need our space.</i>

257
00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:19.363
-[whirring]
-[gulps]

258
00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.031
So you knew all about this?

259
00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:24.034
How... When... [stammers]

260
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.161
For how long?

261
00:21:25.244 --> 00:21:28.956
About a week ago. out of curiosity.
I asked John Cena.

262
00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:31.667
"Why do you people drink so much milk?"

263
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:33.819
We had been hanging out together.

264
00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.755
He was teaching me
the sunset flip power bomb.

265
00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:39.300
And what was your reaction?

266
00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:40.634
Do-do you even have one?

267
00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.469
As I said. it is troubling.

268
00:21:43.637 --> 00:21:44.888
Very much so.

269
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:48.273
It probably helps that
I've had time to think about it.

270
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.854
I must say John Cena makes
a fairly reasonable case.

271
00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:53.647
In French. he's even more convincing.

272
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.817
That is not John Cena.

273
00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:00.404
Jesus Christ. why are you so...

274
00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:01.572
[stammers]

275
00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:06.076
How about the fact that in Spain
they all said they were vegetarians?

276
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.245
Ah. yes. I asked John about that.

277
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.664
He reminded me that
technically what they said was

278
00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:13.334
that they would prefer to be vegetarian.

279
00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:16.545
Oh. great. so all the fucking
lawyers in the world survived.

280
00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.005
Carol. for the record.

281
00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:22.093
I am in no way pleased with the idea
of these people eating human flesh.

282
00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:23.719
None of us are.

283
00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:24.887
Us?

284
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:27.723
Who's us?

285
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:33.521
The other individuals.

286
00:22:33.604 --> 00:22:34.897
[champagne pours]

287
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.899
The ones like you and me.

288
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.443
We stay in touch.

289
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.114
You stay in touch?

290
00:22:43.197 --> 00:22:45.032
-Mm-hmm.
-All 12 of you?

291
00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:47.451
Uh. all but one.
There's a gentleman in Paraguay.

292
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:50.621
Uh. chaperones reach out.
but he doesn't reply.

293
00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:54.458
But the other 11 of us. yes.

294
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.293
So the 11 of you. you...

295
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:00.047
What? You just hang out?

296
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.426
Potluck suppers and whatnot.

297
00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:05.136
-We meet occasionally.
-Okay.

298
00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:07.012
Tuesdays and Fridays.

299
00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:08.556
Oh. well. that's a lot of flying.

300
00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:10.057
Mostly. we're on Zoom.

301
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.225
Oh.

302
00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:13.852
Right.

303
00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:16.219
What do you guys talk about?

304
00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:19.984
I mean. it can't be saving the world
'cause you shot that down really quickly.

305
00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:21.944
In a sense it is.

306
00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:27.783
Carol. what John Cena did not mention
is that even with the HDP.

307
00:23:28.784 --> 00:23:32.705
most of the world's population will
starve to death within the next ten years.

308
00:23:32.788 --> 00:23:34.623
-Says who?
-Says them.

309
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.376
If you press them long enough.

310
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:40.587
We wish to save them from that.

311
00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:44.572
At our most recent gathering.
we pitched the idea of robotic farming.

312
00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:48.262
However. as it is. they would have
to build and program the robots.

313
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:49.930
-Ah.
-Hmm.

314
00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:51.515
They did appreciate the input.

315
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:53.100
-[scoffs] I bet.
-Mmm.

316
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:58.313
Did you guys ever talk about
including me in the Zooms?

317
00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:00.607
I mean...

318
00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:04.653
I am a professional writer.
and no offense.

319
00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:07.656
but I can come up with shit
like robots all day long.

320
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.491
We. uh...

321
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:11.618
We took a vote.

322
00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:13.621
It was not unanimous.

323
00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:17.541
but the majority felt
your presence might prove. uh...

324
00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.169
disruptive.

325
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:23.005
Oh.

326
00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:25.591
Also. our non-English speakers
were perhaps a bit offended that

327
00:24:25.674 --> 00:24:28.218
you did not invite them
to join us in Spain.

328
00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.847
I'm sorry. Carol.

329
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.433
Mmm. Ultimately this is not about you.

330
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.436
Or any of us. for that matter.

331
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.937
Yeah. sure. I get it.

332
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:43.942

Yes. I know.

Okay.

00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:46.185
Hmm.

361
00:28:49.354 --> 00:28:50.355
[in English] So...

362
00:28:51.315 --> 00:28:52.691
what are your plans?

363
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:56.529
Well. I'm sure you need a break from me.

364
00:28:56.612 --> 00:28:58.113
[chuckles]

365
00:28:59.698 --> 00:29:01.700
I have enjoyed your company. Carol.

366
00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:03.536
-You like your space. I get it.
-No.

367
00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:07.790
So. I was thinking
I'll go find my own suite.

368
00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:09.791
get cleaned up. and then. uh.

369
00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:12.169
we can get together later.

370
00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:13.962
Talk some more.

371
00:29:21.053 --> 00:29:22.304
[slurping]

372
00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:28.018
I'm just messing with you.

373
00:29:28.101 --> 00:29:30.187
[both laughing]

374
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:35.234
[in French] Well done.

375
00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:38.195
[in English] Truth is.
I can't get out of Vegas fast enough.

376
00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:42.699
This city is like
a trillion dollar light-up ashtray.

377
00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.245
No offense to your new town.

378
00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:48.163
No. none taken.

379
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.582
I'm sure it's no Albuquerque.

380
00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:53.210
[both chuckle]

381
00:29:54.336 --> 00:29:56.255
Carol. you can always call me.

382
00:29:56.338 --> 00:29:59.007
Dial zero.
and they will find me wherever I am.

383
00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:00.926
Thanks.

384
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:02.719
How you say. uh.

385
00:30:03.303 --> 00:30:05.055
"check in" now and then. hmm?

386
00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:06.390
Sure.

387
00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:11.668
Maybe you will have some ideas on how
to save these people from starvation.

388
00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:14.546
[Carol] I don't know.

389
00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:17.484
Maybe tell 'em to pick a fucking apple.

390
00:30:18.402 --> 00:30:20.153
-Wow.
-Sorry.

391
00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:21.864
I didn't mean that.

392
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:24.700
I mean. fuck it. yes. I did.

393
00:30:25.284 --> 00:30:26.535
I meant that. but...

394
00:30:27.744 --> 00:30:28.912
not like it sounded.

395
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.624
I'm not some kind of monster. you know?

396
00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:34.251
I just. um...

397
00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:36.253
They're doing this to themselves.

398
00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:38.339
They are choosing to starve.

399
00:30:38.422 --> 00:30:40.674
-They do not see it that way.
-Listen to me.

400
00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:45.012
The only way to save these lunatics
is to turn them back the way they were.

401
00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:48.307
There is a way to reverse this.

402
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.975
Help me find it.

403
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:53.521
Do you seriously think
the world is a better place now.

404
00:30:53.604 --> 00:30:55.105
just because it's peaceful?

405
00:30:56.064 --> 00:30:57.149
[sighs]

406
00:30:57.232 --> 00:31:00.986
Well. once they turn us.
we're gonna starve right along with them.

407
00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:02.738
Have you thought of that?

408
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:05.616
They cannot turn us.

409
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:08.493
not without our consent.

410
00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:13.749
What do you mean?

411
00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:16.460
It seems the only way
to make their virus work on us

412
00:31:16.543 --> 00:31:19.797
is by tailoring it
to our individual stem cells.

413
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.551
But to obtain those stem cells. they
must first collect them from our bodies.

414
00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:25.803
Um. what... What?

415
00:31:25.886 --> 00:31:29.973
Apparently that involves sticking
a large needle into the bone of the hip.

416
00:31:30.807 --> 00:31:32.226
Somewhat painful.

417
00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:33.685
And very invasive.

418
00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:38.440
Something they cannot do
without our permission.

419
00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.402
When did you find this out?

420
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.072
They made this discovery only yesterday.

421
00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:48.485
[chuckles] They are not pleased about it.
I can assure you.

422
00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:52.120
They asked me if I would give my consent.

423
00:31:53.163 --> 00:31:54.331
I said. uh.

424
00:31:55.123 --> 00:31:58.877
"Regrettably. as of this time.
I prefer not to."
