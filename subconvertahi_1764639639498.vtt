00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:26.880
<i>- Answer the phone.
- Where's my suitcase?</i>

3
00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:31.801
<i>I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?</i>

4
00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:35.430
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me.
Girls.

5
00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:38.600
Hey. hey. little fella.

6
00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:41.060
Excuse me. girls. Girls.
Take the witches!

7
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:43.229
Hey. Hey. big fella.
Excuse me.

8
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:46.649
Come help me make up these beds in
the living room! Excuse me. Ma'am!

9
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.194
Hi. Hey. son! Son!
Who stole my book bag?

10
00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:52.864
Big fella! Hey! Hey. hey. hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

11
00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:57.243
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh. it's crazy.

12
00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:59.579
Trish is going to Montreal.
Montreal?

13
00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.748
Uh-huh. That's right.
Her family's there.

14
00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:03.792
And we're off.
When do you leave?

15
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.835
Tomorrow.
You're not ready. are you?

16
00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.673
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me watch
the movie. but the big kids can.

17
00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:13.551
- Why can't I?
- Kevin. I'm on the phone.

18
00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:16.137
When do you come back?
Not till then?

19
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.599
It's not even rated
He's just being a jerk.

20
00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:22.936
Kevin. if Uncle Frank
says no.

21
00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.230
then it must be really bad.

22
00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:27.482
We're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him-

23
00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:29.984
Hey. hey. hey! Get off.
Kevin. out of the room.

24
00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:32.445
Hang up the phone and make me.
why don't ya?

25
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.491
Oh. this kid. Kate. did you by any
chance pick up a voltage adaptor thing?

26
00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:38.493
I didn't have time
to do that.

27
00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:40.453
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

28
00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:43.498
Grow a goatee. Dad. nobody'll
let me do anything.

29
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.500
I've got something
for you to do.

30
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:48.086
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

31
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.047
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

32
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.217
<i>- He was in the garage again.
playing with the glue gun.</i>
- Didn't we talk about that?

33
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.345
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

34
00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:59.597
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

35
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:01.474
My new fishhooks?

36
00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:06.312
I can't make ornaments out of the old
ones. with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

37
00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:10.275
- Peter.
- Come on. Kevin. Out.

38
00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:12.819
Peter. Kate. do you guys
have a voltage adaptor?

39
00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:16.197
Here! Here's a voltage adaptor.
Oh. you're getting heavy.

40
00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:18.449
Go pack your suitcase.

41
00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:22.662
Pack my suitcase?

42
00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:25.290
Do you know where the shampoo is. Fuller?
I don't live here.

43
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.792
A house with this many people.
there's no shampoo?

44
00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:30.044
Are your parents home? Yeah.
but they don't live here.

45
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.839
<i>Tracy. did you order
the pizza?</i>
Buzz did.

46
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:36.175
<i>Excuse me. miss. Are your parents here?</i>
My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

47
00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:38.177
Hi!
Hi!

48
00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:39.846
Are your parents home?
Yeah.

49
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:41.890
Do they live here?
No.

50
00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:46.978
No. Why should they? All kids. no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

51
00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:51.107
I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've
never done this once in my whole life.

52
00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:53.484
Tough.
That's what Megan said.

53
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.321
What did I say?
You told Kevin. “Tough.”

54
00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:59.157
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

55
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.701
Shake his hand and say.
“Congratulations. you're an idiot”?

56
00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:04.704
I'm not an idiot! Oh. really?
You're completely helpless!

57
00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.582
Everyone has to do everything for you.
She's right. Kev.

58
00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:11.502
Excuse me. puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than
you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

59
00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:15.214
I hope you didn't just pack crap. Jeff.
Shut up. Linnie.

60
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.216
Do you know what
I should pack?

61
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.595
Buzz told you. cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

62
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:23.640
Listen. Kev. what are
you so worried about?

63
00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:26.517
<i>You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.</i>

64
00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:29.854
You're what the French call
<i>les incompetents.</i>

65
00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:33.942
- What?
- Bombs away!

66
00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:41.950
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

67
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.828
If he has something to drink.
he's gonna wet the bed.

68
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:48.706
This house is so full of people.
it makes me sick!

69
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.834
When I grow up and get married.
I'm livin' alone!

70
00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:54.754
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

71
00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:57.590
<i>I'm livin' alone!</i>

72
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:02.345
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

73
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:06.849
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

74
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.479
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

75
00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:14.273
Some don't.

76
00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:16.275
But they got nude beaches.

77
00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.404
Not in the winter.

78
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:27.829
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock. phlegm-wad?

79
00:05:27.912 --> 00:05:31.457
Can I sleep in your room? I don't
want to sleep with Fuller.

80
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.501
If he has something to drink.
he'll wet the bed.

81
00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:38.256
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

82
00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:43.261
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

83
00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:48.725
Who is he?

84
00:05:48.808 --> 00:05:53.146
<i>You ever heard of the
South Bend Shovel Slayer?</i>

85
00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:55.189
<i>No.
That's him.</i>

86
00:05:55.273 --> 00:06:00.111
<i>Back in '58. he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...</i>

87
00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:03.531
with a snow shovel.

88
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:06.951
Been hiding out in this
neighborhood ever since.

89
00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:10.538
Well. if he's the Shovel Slayer. how
come the cops don't arrest him?

90
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:12.540
Not enough evidence
to convict.

91
00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:15.209
<i>They never found
the bodies.</i>

92
00:06:15.293 --> 00:06:17.545
<i>But everyone around here
knows he did it.</i>

93
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:21.382
Now it'll just be a matter of
time before he does it again.

94
00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:23.468
What's he doin' now?

95
00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:27.513
<i>He walks up and down
the streets every night...</i>

96
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:29.891
<i>salting the sidewalks.</i>

97
00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:31.976
<i>Maybe he's just
trying to be nice.</i>

98
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:35.938
No way.

99
00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:39.067
See that garbage can
full of salt?

100
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.153
<i>That's where he keeps
his victims.</i>

101
00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:45.156
<i>The salt
turns the bodies...</i>

102
00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:48.034
<i>into mummies.</i>

103
00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.120
Wow.
Mummies.

104
00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.502
Look out!

105
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:32.078
<i>How you
kids doin' huh ? Good?</i>

106
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:34.872
Lot of action
around here today. huh?

107
00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:37.667
Goin' on vacation?
Where you goin'?

108
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.088
<i>Do you hear me or what?
Goin' on a trip?</i>

109
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.257
Where you goin'. kid?

110
00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:56.602
Okay. that's 122.50.

111
00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:58.604
Not for me. kid.
I don't live here.

112
00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:02.692
Oh. You just around for the holidays?
I guess you could say that.

113
00:08:02.817 --> 00:08:06.195
Hey. pizza's here! Here you go.
That's 122.50.

114
00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.948
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

115
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:12.285
Hey. listen. uh-

116
00:08:12.368 --> 00:08:15.746
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

117
00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:18.166
Yeah. The Mr. McCallister
who lives here?

118
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.335
Yes. Oh. good. 'cause
somebody owes me 122.50.

119
00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:24.964
- I'd like a word with you. sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

120
00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:28.885
No. no. it's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

121
00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:33.347
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

122
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:37.602
Oh. yeah. Well. we have automatic timers
for our lights. locks for our doors.

123
00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:39.770
<i>That's about as well
as anybody can do.</i>

124
00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:42.064
You get some eggnog?
Come on. Dad.

125
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.066
Let's eat.
Come on.

126
00:08:44.192 --> 00:08:47.153
Eggnog? Listen. are you
gonna be leaving. uh-
<i>Pizza! Pizza!</i>

127
00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.155
Pizza!

128
00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:52.408
<i>Grab yourself a napkin. You're
gonna have to pour your own drinks.</i>

129
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:54.577
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

130
00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:56.954
What time do we have to go to bed?
Early.

131
00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:59.540
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

132
00:08:59.624 --> 00:09:03.836
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want
to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

133
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:08.132
Honey. the pizza boy needs
$122.50. plus a tip. For pizza?

134
00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:10.009
<i>Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.</i>

135
00:09:10.134 --> 00:09:12.720
Frank. you've got money. Come on.
Traveler's checks.

136
00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:15.681
Forget it. Frank.
We have cash.

137
00:09:15.765 --> 00:09:18.434
<i>You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.</i>

138
00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:21.520
Did anyone order me
a plain cheese?

139
00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:24.065
Oh. yeah. we did.
But if you want any.

140
00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:27.401
somebody's gonna have to barf
it all up. 'cause it's gone.

141
00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:31.030
<i>Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.</i>

142
00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:41.207
Kev! Kevin. get a plate.

143
00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:50.132
Wow!

144
00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:53.052
The passports!
Watch it!

145
00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:56.264
Help me out here!

146
00:09:56.347 --> 00:09:59.183
Let's get these
passports out of here.

147
00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:02.770
<i>- Kevin. get off of him!
- You moron!</i>

148
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:06.440
Are you okay. honey? Come here.
Are you all right?

149
00:10:06.524 --> 00:10:08.317
What is the matter
with you?

150
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.320
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

151
00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:13.698
<i>He knows I hate sausage
and olives and-</i>

152
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:16.242
Look what you did.
you little jerk!

153
00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:32.383
- Kevin. get upstairs right now.
- Why?

154
00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:35.720
- Kevin. you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

155
00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.555
- Kevin. upstairs!
- Say good night. Kevin.

156
00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:41.934
- Good night. Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

157
00:10:42.018 --> 00:10:44.312
Why do I always get
treated like scum?

158
00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.814
Oh. I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

159
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:48.816
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

160
00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:52.570
My brother-in-law drove in from Ohio today.
it's just nuts.

161
00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:55.281
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

162
00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:57.366
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

163
00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.952
Thanks.
Having a reunion
or something?

164
00:11:00.036 --> 00:11:01.954
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

165
00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:05.958
<i>and his kids are still going to school here.
and I guess he missed the whole family.</i>

166
00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:08.669
<i>He's giving us this trip to
Paris so we can be together.</i>

167
00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:12.548
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes. we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

168
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.925
Excellent. Excellent.

169
00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:18.179
If you'll excuse me. this one's
out of sorts. I'll be right back.

170
00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:21.098
Don't worry about me. I spoke
to your husband already.

171
00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.392
<i>And don't worry
about your home.</i>

172
00:11:23.476 --> 00:11:25.936
It's in good hands.

173
00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:32.193
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one who has to make trouble.

174
00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:35.363
I'm the only one getting dumped on.
You're the only one acting up.

175
00:11:35.488 --> 00:11:40.076
Now get upstairs.
I am upstairs. dummy.

176
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:42.745
The third floor?
Go.

177
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.123
It's scary up there. Don't be silly.
Fuller will be up in a little while.

178
00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:49.418
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

179
00:11:49.502 --> 00:11:51.712
<i>He'll pee all over me.
I know it.</i>

180
00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:53.839
Fine. We'll put him
somewhere else.

181
00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:56.467
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.136
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

183
00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:04.183
Everyone in this
family hates me.

184
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:06.519
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

185
00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:10.272
I don't want a new family! I don't
want any family! Families suck!

186
00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:13.567
Stay up there. I don't want to see
you again for the rest of the night.

187
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:16.320
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

188
00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:19.115
<i>And I don't want to see
anybody else either.</i>

189
00:12:19.198 --> 00:12:21.200
I hope you don't mean that.

190
00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:25.204
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow
morning and you didn't have a family.

191
00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:28.874
No. I wouldn't.
<i>Then say it again.</i>

192
00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:33.379
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

193
00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:57.528
I wish they
would all just disappear.

194
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.713
Where are they? I don't know.
She said 8:00 sharp.

195
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:09.517
Peter!

196
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.602
We slept in!

197
00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:31.372
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

198
00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:34.875
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando. Florida.

199
00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:38.671
Well. actually. first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

200
00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:41.340
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

201
00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:45.219
Do you know if it's cold there? Do
these vans get good gas mileage?

202
00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:48.264
Gee. kid. I don't know.
Hit the road.

203
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.269
Heather. do a head count. Make
sure everyone's in the vans.

204
00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:55.271
Where are the passports
and tickets?

205
00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.273
I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

206
00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:59.275
How fast does this thing go?

207
00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:03.320
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have four-wheel drive?

208
00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:07.658
Look. I told you before. kid.
don't bother me. Now beat it.

209
00:15:15.124 --> 00:15:17.042
Come on. Hurry up.

210
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:22.548
<i>Line up in front off the van.</i>
Did you take my batteries?

211
00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:25.092
<i>Line up and shut up!</i>
Wow!

212
00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:27.845
<i>Shut up. I gotta
take a head count.</i>

213
00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:32.057
- One. two. three. four. five-
- Eleven. 92. 12.

214
00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:34.560
Buzz. don't be a moron.

215
00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:37.855
Six. seven. eight.

216
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.524
nine. 10. 11.

217
00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:43.777
Okay. Half in this van. half in this van.
Come on. Let's go.

218
00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.447
Have a good trip.

219
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.574
Bring me back something French.

220
00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:55.205
There's no way on earth we're gonna make
this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

221
00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:58.584
Think positive. Frank. You be positive.
I'll be realistic.

222
00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.628
Ma'am? Ma'am?
What?

223
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.755
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

224
00:16:02.838 --> 00:16:06.300
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma
Bell a couple of clays to patch 'em up.

225
00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:08.886
Especially around the holidays.
Okay. thanks.

226
00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:12.306
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven. including me.

227
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:17.227
Five boys. six girls. four parents. two
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

228
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.280
<i>♪ Out of all the reindeer you

229
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:35.037

232
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.929
This way!

233
00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.516
- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?

234
00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:58.143
No. you just made it.

235
00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:02.398
Single seats only in coach. Take
whatever's free. Thank you.

236
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:04.692
I get a window seat!

237
00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.113
<i>You kids are in coach.
We're up here.</i>

238
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.907
<i>Here are your seats. Five "A"
and "B" and four "A" and "B".</i>

239
00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.952
I'll take your coats.
Thank you.

240
00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.912
Fasten your seat belts.

241
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.581
Champagne. please. it's free. isn't it?
Oh. yes.

242
00:17:19.707 --> 00:17:23.377
We made it.
Do you believe it?

243
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.629
Hope we didn't
forget anything.

244
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:13.010
What are you doing
out of costume?

245
00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.012
Now get back
and get dressed.

246
00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.222
I'm terribly sorry. I thought
you were our Santa Claus.

247
00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:19.183
Your Santa Claus
is intoxicated.

248
00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:21.435
<i>Oh. no. Yes.</i>

249
00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:24.605
<i>It's disgraceful!
How can you allow a man-</i>

250
00:18:30.027 --> 00:18:32.780
<i>What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed!</i>

251
00:18:32.863 --> 00:18:36.533
<i>But it's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.</i>

252
00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:38.535
<i>I ought to
take this cane and-</i>

253
00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:43.248
<i>Julia. get some black
coffee and plenty of it.</i>

254
00:18:43.332 --> 00:18:45.292
Black with a little cream.

255
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.586
Mom?

256
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:55.302
Thank you.

257
00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:58.597
That's real crystal. It's real.
Yeah. So?

258
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:02.976
Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em!
Put 'em! I can't do that.

259
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.978
Put them in your purse!

260
00:19:05.062 --> 00:19:09.233
Uh. yeah. yeah. fill it up. fill it up.
Fill it up. please.

261
00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:11.235
Thank you.

262
00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:14.738
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

263
00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:16.740
No. the kids are fine.

264
00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:20.994
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the
family station wagon. and it wasn't to France.

265
00:19:21.078 --> 00:19:24.373
We used to have to go over to Aunt
Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

266
00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:27.376
The kids are okay. They're having
the time of their lives. Yeah.

267
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.462
Hello?

268
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.590
Mom?

269
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.344
Dad?

270
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:43.475
Mom? Dad?

271
00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:48.230
Where are you guys?

272
00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.315
Buzz?

273
00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:53.694
Buzz?

274
00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.657
Buzz?

275
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.288
Megan?

276
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.959
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

277
00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:12.045
Rod? Uncle Frank?

278
00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:14.464
Uncle Frank. is this a joke?

279
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.303
<i>Megan? Linnie?</i>

280
00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:23.849
Is this a joke?

281
00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:51.543
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

282
00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:12.189
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

283
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.877
I made my family disappear.

284
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.130
Kevin. you're
completely helpless.

285
00:21:37.214 --> 00:21:41.802
You know. Kevin. you're what the
French call <i>les incompetents.</i>

286
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:45.138
Kevin. I'm going to feed
you to my tarantula.

287
00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:48.225
Kevin. you are
such a disease.

288
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.519
There are 15 people
in this house...

289
00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:53.438
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

290
00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:56.900
Look what you did.
you little jerk.

291
00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:03.824
I made my family disappear.

292
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.217
I'm free! Free! Free!

293
00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:34.104
Wow!

294
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:43.780
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

295
00:22:43.864 --> 00:22:48.035
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

296
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:51.121
Buzz. I'm going through
all your private stuff!

297
00:22:51.204 --> 00:22:54.166
You better come out
and pound me!

298
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:00.756
Buzz. your girlfriend!
Woof!

299
00:23:49.513 --> 00:23:51.515
Who is it?

300
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:57.896
It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.

301
00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:01.108
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

302
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:04.402
<i>All right. Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

303
00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:08.031
<i>What money?
Acey said you had some dough for me.</i>

304
00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:11.118
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

305
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:14.079
Acey said 10%.

306
00:24:14.162 --> 00:24:16.832
Too bad Acey ain't
in charge no more.

307
00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:19.876
<i>What do you mean?
</i> Guys. I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

308
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.963
You better come out
and stop me!

309
00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:25.674
<i>He'll call
you when he gets out.</i>

310
00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:27.467
Hey.

311
00:24:27.551 --> 00:24:30.345
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you. Snakes.

312
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.224
I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...

313
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:37.435
<i>to get your ugly. yellow.</i>

314
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:39.646
<i>no-good keister
off my property...</i>

315
00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:41.857
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

316
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.526
All right. Johnny.
I'm sorry. I'm goin'.

317
00:24:44.609 --> 00:24:47.195
<i>One. two. ten!</i>

318
00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:04.880
Keep the change.
ya filthy animal.

319
00:25:06.506 --> 00:25:08.091
Mom!

320
00:25:19.436 --> 00:25:22.022
What's the matter?

321
00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:24.482
Honey?

322
00:25:24.608 --> 00:25:28.153
I have a terrible feeling.
About what?

323
00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:31.364
That we didn't do something.

324
00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:34.743
Oh. no. you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

325
00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:38.205
<i>We took care of everything.
Believe me. we did.</i>
Did I turn off the coffee?

326
00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:41.208
No. I did.

327
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:43.293
<i>Did you lock up?</i>

328
00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:45.295
Yeah.

329
00:25:45.378 --> 00:25:48.089
Did you close the garage?

330
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:53.887
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

331
00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:01.811
No. that's not it.

332
00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:05.190
What else could
we be forgetting?

333
00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:11.321
Kevin!

334
00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:40.225
Whoa!

335
00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:45.021
Whoa! Whoa!

336
00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:56.950
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

337
00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:01.454
We'll call as soon as we land. Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

338
00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:05.208
It's horrible. Horrible.
just horrible.

339
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:08.378
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

340
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.755
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

341
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:14.134
What kind of mother am I?

342
00:27:14.217 --> 00:27:18.013
<i>If it makes you feel any better.
I forgot my reading glasses.</i>

343
00:27:22.642 --> 00:27:25.270
<i>Five families
gone on one block alone.</i>

344
00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:28.315
<i>They all told me
from their own mouths.</i>

345
00:27:28.398 --> 00:27:30.358
<i>It's almost too easy.</i>

346
00:27:30.442 --> 00:27:34.321
Check it out. All the
houses with nobody home...

347
00:27:34.404 --> 00:27:37.574
have automatic timers
on their lights.

348
00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:40.577
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

349
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.540
Number 664 will be
going on...

350
00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:48.918
<i>fight about... now.</i>

351
00:27:50.587 --> 00:27:53.673
Oh. Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

352
00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:56.384
Number 672.

353
00:27:57.594 --> 00:28:00.305
right... now.

354
00:28:00.388 --> 00:28:03.600
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

355
00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:07.937
671 now.

356
00:28:10.065 --> 00:28:13.401
And that's the one. Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

357
00:28:13.485 --> 00:28:15.653
Oh. it's very

358
00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:18.698
Very huh?
it's loaded.

359
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:21.159
It's got lots
of topflight goods.

360
00:28:21.284 --> 00:28:24.746
<i>Stereos. VCR's.</i>
Toys.

361
00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:29.334
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry.
Possible cash hoard.

362
00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:33.671
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows?

363
00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:35.965
<i>It's a gem.</i>

364
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:38.051
Grab your crowbar.

365
00:28:39.302 --> 00:28:41.304
Crowbars up.

369
00:29:40.196 --> 00:29:44.325
Which way? We'll go around back
down the basement. Follow me.

370
00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:06.222
I thought you said
they were gone.

371
00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:10.185
They were supposed to leave this morning.
Let's get out of here.

372
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:49.265
We have to use the phone. please.

373
00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:52.101
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

374
00:30:52.227 --> 00:30:55.230
Please! Our brother's home alone.

375
00:30:55.355 --> 00:30:58.608
Give us the phone! Thank you.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

376
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:01.694
Peter. I'm gonna call the police. Why
don't you book us a flight home.

377
00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:06.449
Get some change out of here. Call
everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

378
00:31:06.533 --> 00:31:09.702
<i>Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everybody who lives on our street.</i>

379
00:31:09.827 --> 00:31:11.746
Maybe somebody can help us.

380
00:31:11.829 --> 00:31:15.875
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

381
00:31:21.047 --> 00:31:25.009
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

382
00:31:25.093 --> 00:31:29.222
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

383
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:39.399
Hey! I'm not
afraid anymore!

384
00:31:40.817 --> 00:31:44.821
I said.
I'm not afraid anymore!

385
00:31:44.904 --> 00:31:47.740
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore!

386
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.732
Village Police Department.

387
00:32:20.815 --> 00:32:24.360
Hi. Look. I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

388
00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:27.864
Our phones are out of order. so I'd
like somebody to go to our house...

389
00:32:27.947 --> 00:32:29.866
and tell him we're
coming home to get him.

390
00:32:29.949 --> 00:32:31.993
Let me connect you with
Family Crisis Intervention.

391
00:32:32.118 --> 00:32:34.996
It's not a family crisis.
Hold on.

392
00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:40.335
Larry. can you pick up? There's some
lady on hold. sounds kind of hyper.

393
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.212
What line. Rose?
Uh. two.

394
00:32:43.296 --> 00:32:45.924
Family Crisis Intervention.
Sergeant Balzak.

395
00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:49.010
I am calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

396
00:32:49.093 --> 00:32:51.012
Has the child been involved
in a violent altercation...

397
00:32:51.095 --> 00:32:53.931
with a drunken and/or mentally ill
member of his immediate family?

398
00:32:54.015 --> 00:32:57.977
- No.
- Has he been involved
in a household accident?

399
00:32:58.061 --> 00:33:00.313
I don't know. I don't-
I hope not.

400
00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:02.899
Has the child ingested
any poison...

401
00:33:02.982 --> 00:33:05.693
and/or any other object that has
become lodged in his throat?

402
00:33:05.777 --> 00:33:09.405
No. he's just home alone! I would like
somebody to go over to the house...

403
00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:12.325
and see that he's all right.
just to check on him.

404
00:33:12.408 --> 00:33:16.079
You want us to go to your house
just to check on him?

405
00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:19.624
- Yes!
- Let me connect you
with the police department.

406
00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:22.168
- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

407
00:33:22.293 --> 00:33:24.754
Yeah?
Hyper on two.
Hold on. please.

408
00:33:24.837 --> 00:33:28.800
No. please don't hang up.
Please. don't- Any luck?

409
00:33:28.883 --> 00:33:32.470
No. We couldn't
get anybody.

410
00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:36.432
<i>Leslie?</i>
I'm sorry. Kate. Nothing but
a bunch of answering machines.

411
00:33:38.643 --> 00:33:42.313
Somebody pick up.
Pick up!

412
00:33:42.397 --> 00:33:44.941
- Hi. ma'am. it's you again.
- Yeah. hi. Look.

413
00:33:45.024 --> 00:33:47.902
I'm calling from Paris. I have
a son who's home alone. and I-

414
00:33:47.985 --> 00:33:51.989
Okay. okay. We'll send a policeman over
to your house to check on your son.

415
00:34:22.186 --> 00:34:24.856
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

416
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:28.067
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
- Ten-four.

417
00:34:28.151 --> 00:34:30.737
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody-

418
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.531
I'm sorry. but there's
no way I can do that.

419
00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:35.491
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

420
00:34:35.616 --> 00:34:38.161
If you explained this is an emergency.
I wish I could-

421
00:34:38.244 --> 00:34:40.705
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

422
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:45.168
That's a relief. Everything here is booked.
There's nothing to Chicago?

423
00:34:45.251 --> 00:34:48.588
There's nothing to Chicago. New York.
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

424
00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:53.092
- What about a private plane?
- No. I'm sorry. We don't do that.

425
00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:56.220
The only thing they have is a booking
for all of us on Friday morning.

426
00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:58.556
Friday morning?
That's two days away.

427
00:34:58.639 --> 00:35:01.100
Look. honey. the kids are exhausted.
You are exhausted.

428
00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:03.853
There's absolutely nothing more
we can do in this airport.

429
00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:08.065
I say we go to Rob's. call the police
again. and they can get back to us.

430
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:11.944
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

431
00:35:12.028 --> 00:35:13.946
<i>Madame. we are doing
everything we can.</i>

432
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.992
If you want to stay at the airport.
maybe we can get you on standby.

433
00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:21.496
<i>It is a possibility
that a seat will 0.0 en up.</i>

434
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:24.749
Is that okay?
Yes. I'll wait.

435
00:35:29.837 --> 00:35:33.424
Bye. I'll miss you.
Bye.

436
00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:35.802
Find Kevin.

437
00:35:35.927 --> 00:35:38.596
Don't you get lost.

438
00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:40.807
Good-bye.

439
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.809
<i>Good-bye. Kate.</i>

440
00:35:42.892 --> 00:35:45.978
<i>♪ Please come home

441

<i>♪ 'Cause I'll be happy
at Christmas ♪</i>

442
00:35:56.739 --> 00:36:00.201
I took a shower. washing every
body part with actual soap.

443
00:36:00.284 --> 00:36:04.831
including all my major crevices. including
in between my toes and in my belly button.

444
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.375
which I never did before.
but sort of enjoyed.

445
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:10.127
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

446
00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:13.381
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

447
00:36:13.464 --> 00:36:17.510
I can't seem to find my toothbrush. so
I'll pick one up when I go out today.

448
00:36:17.593 --> 00:36:19.637
Other than that.
I'm in good shape.

449
00:36:53.963 --> 00:36:55.923
Whoa!

450
00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:13.107
All right!
Buzz's life savings.

451
00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:43.095
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

452
00:37:58.986 --> 00:38:02.490
You know. you're one of the great
cat burglars of the world. Marv.

453
00:38:02.615 --> 00:38:05.201
You think you could keep it
down a little in there?

454
00:38:05.284 --> 00:38:10.122
<i>Hi. you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.</i>

455
00:38:10.206 --> 00:38:15.002
Chuck. this is Peter McCallister again. and
we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.

456
00:38:15.086 --> 00:38:18.214
<i>Let me give you the number here. okay?
The couhtry code is 3-3.</i>

457
00:38:18.297 --> 00:38:20.174
The area code is 1-4.

458
00:38:20.299 --> 00:38:24.553
And the number is 694-8764.
Hey. Harry?

459
00:38:24.637 --> 00:38:28.599
- Yeah?
- House we were at last night.
was that the McCallisters?

460
00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:31.185
<i>Yeah.</i>
Call me in Paris.

461
00:38:31.268 --> 00:38:33.896
You're right.
They're gone.

462
00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:40.111
I knew they were.
<i>Silver tuna tonight.</i>

463
00:38:42.238 --> 00:38:44.240
<i>Wow.</i>

464
00:38:49.328 --> 00:38:51.330
How may I help you?

465
00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:55.292
Is this toothbrush approved by
the American Dental Association?

466
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:58.129
Well. I don't know.

467
00:38:58.254 --> 00:39:02.091
It doesn't say. hon.
Can you please find out?

468
00:39:05.052 --> 00:39:07.054
- Herb!
- <i>Yeah?</i>

469
00:39:07.138 --> 00:39:10.975
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

470
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.818
Do you know. is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

471
00:39:20.901 --> 00:39:22.820
I don't know.

472
00:39:43.632 --> 00:39:48.054
Just tell him that-
Oh. hon. you pay for that here.

473
00:39:48.137 --> 00:39:50.056
<i>Why don't you just
tell him it's approved?</i>

474
00:39:50.139 --> 00:39:53.517
<i>Wait. son. you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?</i>

475
00:39:53.601 --> 00:39:55.561
<i>Son! Hey!</i>

476
00:39:55.644 --> 00:39:59.440
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

477
00:40:02.818 --> 00:40:06.155

Yeehaw!

487

I'm a criminal.

488
00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:38.164

Yes. you are.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.441
I'm not sick!
That's a sick thing to do!

499
00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:16.202
- We don't need that heat.
- Don't tell me what to do.
I can do it if I want to.

00:42:52.363 --> 00:42:55.699
What's the matter? I don't like
the way that kid looked at me.

<i>Did you see that?
You ever seen him before?</i>

509
00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:00.579

I told you something's wrong.
I knew he looked at me weird.
Why would he run?

513
00:44:16.947 --> 00:44:20.993
<i>Maybe he went in the church.

Snakes?

652
00:57:35.578 --> 00:57:38.498
He sounded like a snake.

653
00:57:42.544 --> 00:57:45.672
Everything's full.

654
00:57:45.755 --> 00:57:47.674
Everything's full?

655
00:57:47.757 --> 00:57:50.009
I'm very sorry.
but it is Christmas Eve.

656
00:57:50.093 --> 00:57:52.262
What about another airline?

657
00:57:57.684 --> 00:58:00.603
Nothing available. May I help you
get a hotel room in the city?

658
00:58:00.728 --> 00:58:04.274
<i>Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.</i>
I can't wait that long.

659
00:58:04.357 --> 00:58:08.778
I'm terribly sorry. ma'am. but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

660
00:58:12.907 --> 00:58:16.077
Go ahead. I'm in your way. You
have places to go. people to see.

661
00:58:16.161 --> 00:58:19.497
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

662
00:58:19.581 --> 00:58:23.626
<i>I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.</i>

663
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:28.173
I have been from Chicago to Paris
to Dallas to- Where the hell am I?

664
00:58:28.256 --> 00:58:30.300
Scranton.

665
00:58:30.383 --> 00:58:33.052
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

666
00:58:33.136 --> 00:58:36.514
And now that I'm this close.
you're telling me it's hopeless?

667
00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:40.310
I'm sorry. No. No. no. no. No Way.
This is Christmas!

668
00:58:40.393 --> 00:58:42.270
The season
of perpetual hope!

669
00:58:42.395 --> 00:58:46.191
Ma'am. if I-
<i>If I have to get out
on your runway and hitchhike.</i>

670
00:58:46.274 --> 00:58:48.234
if it costs me
everything I own.

671
00:58:48.318 --> 00:58:51.196
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself.

672
00:58:51.279 --> 00:58:54.449
I am going to get home
to my son.

673
00:58:54.574 --> 00:58:58.661
Ma'am. if there was anything at
all I could do for you today-
<i>Do it.</i>

674
00:58:58.786 --> 00:59:01.372
Do anything.
<i>I can get you
a hotel room.</i>

675
00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:03.958
What?
Excuse me.

676
00:59:04.042 --> 00:59:09.756
<i>Can you excuse us for a second?
Can I see you for a second?
Please. Excuse us. Come.</i>

677
00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:13.051
Couldn't help but hearin' you got
a little bit of a dilemma there.

678
00:59:13.134 --> 00:59:15.762
We got a crisis ourselves.

679
00:59:15.845 --> 00:59:19.349
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

680
00:59:19.432 --> 00:59:22.852
Polka king of the Midwest?

681
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:28.441
The Kenosha Kickers?

682
00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:30.235
Hi there.
Hiya.

683
00:59:30.318 --> 00:59:33.196
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized-

684
00:59:33.279 --> 00:59:36.241
Anyways. uh. I had
a few hits a few years ago.

685
00:59:36.324 --> 00:59:39.619
Uh. that's why. you know-
“Polka. Polka. Polka”?

686
00:59:42.163 --> 00:59:44.207
No? “Twin Lakes Polka.”

687
00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:47.710
“Yamahoozie Polka.”
a.k.a. “Kiss Me Polka.”

688
00:59:47.835 --> 00:59:50.505
“Polka Twist.”
These are songs?

689
00:59:50.588 --> 00:59:53.967
Yeah. Yeah. We-
Some fairly big hits for us.

690
00:59:54.092 --> 00:59:56.719
You know. in the early
'70s. you know? Oh.

691
00:59:56.803 --> 00:59:59.389
Yeah. we sold
about 623 copies of that.

692
00:59:59.514 --> 01:00:02.183
In Chicago? No. Sheboygan.
Very big in Sheboygan.

693
01:00:02.267 --> 01:00:04.435
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

694
01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.688
Anyway. I'm rambling on here.

695
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:09.857
<i>Our flight was canceled.
so we gotta drive.</i>

696
01:00:09.941 --> 01:00:13.528
So. uh. see the guy in the yellow
jacket over there by the Budget sign?

697
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:17.365
<i>He's gonna rent us a nice big. uh. van.
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.</i>

698
01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:21.786
I heard you had some problems here. uh. gettin'
to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

699
01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:25.957
Uh. my son. He-
We left and he's there.

700
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.169
<i>Aw. geez.
If you have to get to Chicago.
we'll gladly drive you.</i>

701
01:00:30.253 --> 01:00:32.505
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

702
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:35.258
You'd give me a ride?
<i>Sure we will.
Why not. you know?</i>

703
01:00:35.383 --> 01:00:37.927
<i>You gotta get home
and see your kid.</i>
A ride to Chicago?

704
01:00:38.011 --> 01:00:39.887
Sure. You know.
it's Christmastime.

705
01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:42.515
Thank you.
Oh. thank you.

706
01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:44.934
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

707
01:00:45.018 --> 01:00:46.936
No. I'd love to.

708
01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:11.544
- Hey. Marv. Marv. Marv.
- What?

709
01:01:11.627 --> 01:01:14.130
Look at this.

710
01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:23.056
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a “kindygartener.”

711
01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:55.755
Dad. can you come here
and help me?

712
01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:04.472
Remember that kid we saw the other day?
He lives here.

713
01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:07.475
Well. if the kid's there.
the parents gotta be.

714
01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:10.144
He's home alone.

715
01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:20.321
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

716
01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:22.323
Uh-huh.
Even with the kid here?

717
01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:24.575
Uh-huh. I don't think
that's a good idea.

718
01:02:24.659 --> 01:02:28.162
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

719
01:02:28.246 --> 01:02:30.957
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house. I wanted it.

720
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.418
<i>So let's take it
one step at a time. okay?</i>

721
01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:37.004
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

722
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:40.049
<i>9:00.
This way it's dark then.</i>

723
01:02:40.133 --> 01:02:43.261
Yeah. Kids are scared
of the dark.

724
01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:46.222
You're afraid of the dark too.
Marv. You know you are.

725
01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:48.975
No. I'm not!

726
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.561
Yes. you are.
I'm not. not. not.

727
01:02:51.686 --> 01:02:55.940
You are 50.
Mom. where are you?

728
01:03:09.328 --> 01:03:11.247
Do you play?

729
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:13.374
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

730
01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:15.793
Try it. Try it.
No.

731
01:03:15.877 --> 01:03:17.920
Okay.

732
01:03:42.111 --> 01:03:45.573
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

733
01:03:45.698 --> 01:03:49.660
<i>Hey. nice shoes.
Oh. thanks.</i>

734
01:03:49.744 --> 01:03:53.414
Is he still here? it's really
important that I see him.

735
01:03:53.498 --> 01:03:58.794
He's getting in his car. I guess
if you hurry. you can catch him.

736
01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:03.341
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris
Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

737
01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:06.552
What's next? Rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?

738
01:04:06.636 --> 01:04:09.263
Santa. hold on!

739
01:04:09.347 --> 01:04:11.474
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

740
01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:14.560
If you make it quick. Santa's got a
little get-together he's late for.

741
01:04:14.644 --> 01:04:16.562
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

742
01:04:16.646 --> 01:04:20.566
What makes you say that?
just out of curiosity.

743
01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.277
I'm old enough
to know how it works.

744
01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:26.447
<i>All right.</i>
But I also know
that you work for him.

745
01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:29.617
<i>And I'd like you to give
him a message. Shoot.</i>

746
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.829
I'm Kevin McCallister.
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

747
01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:36.582
- Do you need the phone number?
- No. that's all right.

748
01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.876
Okay. This is
extremely important.

749
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.798
Would you please tell him that. instead of
presents this year. I just want my family back.

750
01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:48.803
<i>No toys. Nothing but Peter. Kate.
Buzz. Megan. Linnie and Jeff.</i>

751
01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:51.097
And my aunt and my cousins.

752
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.433
And. if he has time.
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

753
01:04:56.102 --> 01:04:59.230
Okay. I'll see
what I can do.

754
01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:02.316
Thanks. Wait. Hold on a second.

755
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.528
My elf took the last of the candy
canes home to her boyfriend.

756
01:05:05.653 --> 01:05:07.697
That's okay. No. no. no.
Don't be silly.

757
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.783
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

758
01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.077
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

759
01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.289
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

760
01:05:16.372 --> 01:05:19.000
I won't. Thanks.

761
01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:32.513
Son of a-

762
01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:30.900
Merry Christmas.

763
01:08:30.983 --> 01:08:32.401
Huh?

764
01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:34.612
May I sit down?

765
01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:49.585
That's my granddaughter up there.
The little red-haired girl.

766
01:08:49.668 --> 01:08:53.422
She's about your age.

767
01:08:53.547 --> 01:08:55.758
Do you know her?
No.

768
01:08:55.883 --> 01:08:58.969
You live next to me. don't you?
Yeah.

769
01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:03.557
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

770
01:09:03.641 --> 01:09:07.561
There's a lot of things going around
about me. but none of it's true.

771
01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:09.522
Okay?

772
01:09:09.647 --> 01:09:11.857
You been a good boy this year?
I think so.

773
01:09:11.941 --> 01:09:14.068
<i>Swear to it?</i>

774
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:16.862
- No.
- Yeah. I had a feeling.

775
01:09:16.946 --> 01:09:20.074
Well. this is the place to be if
you're feeling bad about yourself.

776
01:09:20.199 --> 01:09:23.077
It is?
<i>I think so.</i>

777
01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:25.913
<i>Are you feeling bad
ab out yourself?</i>

778
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.419
I've been kind of
a pain lately.

779
01:09:32.503 --> 01:09:34.922
<i>I said some things
I shouldn't have.</i>

780
01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:38.259
I really haven't been
too good this year.

781
01:09:38.384 --> 01:09:41.220
<i>Yeah. I'm kind of
upset about it.</i>

782
01:09:41.303 --> 01:09:43.514
because I really like
my family.

783
01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:46.141
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

784
01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:49.645
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

785
01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:54.233
I think so. How you feel about your
family is a complicated thing.

786
01:09:54.316 --> 01:09:57.862
Especially
with an older brother.

787
01:09:57.945 --> 01:10:02.199
<i>Deep down you always love 'em. but
you can forget that you love 'em.</i>

788
01:10:02.283 --> 01:10:05.035
And you can hurt them.
and they can hurt you.

789
01:10:05.119 --> 01:10:08.873
And that's not just
because you're young.

790
01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:12.209
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

791
01:10:12.293 --> 01:10:14.211
Sure.

792
01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:17.923
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

793
01:10:18.007 --> 01:10:23.679
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

794
01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:27.600
- At church?
- Oh. you're always welcome at church.

795
01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:30.102
I'm not welcome
with my son.

796
01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:34.899
<i>Years back. before you and
your family moved on the block.</i>

797
01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:37.526
I had an argument
with my son.

798
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:41.864
- How old is he?
- Oh. he's grown up.

799
01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:44.575
We lost our tempers.

800
01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.661
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

801
01:10:47.745 --> 01:10:52.666
He said the same. and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

802
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.586
If you miss him.
why don't you call him?

803
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:58.422
I'm afraid if I call him.
he won't talk to me.

804
01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:00.716
<i>How do you know?</i>

805
01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:03.802
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

806
01:11:03.886 --> 01:11:07.598
No offense. but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

807
01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:11.268
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

808
01:11:11.352 --> 01:11:13.604
You're never too old
to be afraid.

809
01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:16.440
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

810
01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:19.985
It's dark. there's weird stuff
down there. and it smells funny.

811
01:11:20.069 --> 01:11:23.489
That sort of thing.
it's bothered me for years.

812
01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:26.033
Basements are like that.

813
01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:29.036
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry.

814
01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:31.121
and I found out
it's not so bad.

815
01:11:31.205 --> 01:11:33.499
All this time
I've been worrying about it.

816
01:11:33.582 --> 01:11:35.876
but if you turn on the lights.
it's no big deal.

817
01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.422
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

818
01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:42.591
What if he won't talk to me?

819
01:11:42.675 --> 01:11:46.011
At least you'll know. Then you
could stop worrying about it.

820
01:11:46.095 --> 01:11:48.722
<i>and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.</i>

821
01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:52.393
I don't care how mad I was.
I'd talk to my dad.

822
01:11:52.476 --> 01:11:54.395
especially
around the holidays.

823
01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:57.648
I don't know.

824
01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:00.901
<i>Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.</i>

825
01:12:00.985 --> 01:12:04.363
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

826
01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:06.323
I send her a check.

827
01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:10.744
I wish my grandparents send that.
They always send me clothes.

828
01:12:10.828 --> 01:12:13.747
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

829
01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:17.126
- Oh. that's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

830
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:20.170
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

831
01:12:20.254 --> 01:12:22.423
- Oh?
- Yeah.

832
01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:26.635
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there
was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

833
01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:30.014
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

834
01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:31.974
You think
about what I said.

835
01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:33.892
<i>All right?
Okay.</i>

836
01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:37.896
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

837
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.607
<i>♪ Merry. merry Christmas
On. on they send ♪</i>

838
01:12:40.691 --> 01:12:43.652
<i>♪ On without end Their
joyful tone to every home ♪</i>

839
01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:47.114
What about you?
Me?

840
01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.199
Yeah. You and your son.

841
01:12:49.283 --> 01:12:52.619
We'll see what happens.

842
01:12:52.703 --> 01:12:55.664
Merry Christmas.

843
01:12:55.748 --> 01:12:57.666
Merry Christmas.

844
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.835

848
01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:54.473
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

849
01:15:21.977 --> 01:15:25.939
Okay. we'll check it out first. We
can always come back for the truck.

850
01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.781
How do you wanna go in?

851
01:15:34.865 --> 01:15:38.327
We'll go to the back door. Maybe
he'll let us in. You never know.

852
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:41.914
Yeah. He's a kid.
Kids are stupid.

853
01:15:43.916 --> 01:15:47.836
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

854
01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.963
and the people
who sold it on sale.

855
01:15:50.047 --> 01:15:51.965
Amen.

856
01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:18.700
This is it.
Don't get scared now.

857
01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:34.466
<i>Merry Christmas.
little fella.</i>

858
01:16:34.549 --> 01:16:37.135
We know that you're in there.

859
01:16:37.219 --> 01:16:40.138
and that you're all alone.

860
01:16:40.222 --> 01:16:42.891
Yeah. come on. kid.
Open up.

861
01:16:42.975 --> 01:16:46.520
It's Santy Claus
and his elf.

862
01:16:47.896 --> 01:16:50.190
We're not gonna hurt you.

863
01:16:50.274 --> 01:16:54.236
No. no. We got
some nice presents for you.

864
01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:57.781
<i>Be a good little fella now
and open the door.</i>

865
01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:03.453
Shoot!

866
01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:07.291
What? What? What?

867
01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:10.460
What? What happened?

868
01:17:10.544 --> 01:17:14.172
Get that little-

869
01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.642

That's it! That's it! I'm goin' around

You're dead. kid.

It's too late for you. kid.
We're already in the house.

887
01:22:57.599 --> 01:23:01.686
<i>We're gonna get you!

I'm gonna kill that kid!

891
01:23:52.487 --> 01:23:55.573
- Marv!

892
01:23:55.657 --> 01:23:57.701
Why the hell'd
you take your shoes off?

893
01:23:57.784 --> 01:24:00.954
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

I'm up here. you morons!
Come and get me!

Aw. shut up. will ya!

My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

01:25:16.404 --> 01:25:18.990
Watch it. You never know
what's up there.

911
01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:22.035
There he is!

912
01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:26.247

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:43.533
Where is it? Where is it?

923
01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:46.828
Never mind did you get it!

Whoa! Whoa!

928
01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:18.985
Where'd he go?

929
01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:21.112
Maybe he committed
suicide.

930
01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:23.364
<i>Down here.
you big horse's ass!</i>

931
01:27:23.448 --> 01:27:26.367
Come and get me

01:27:26.492 --> 01:27:28.703
Let's get him!
Wait. Wait.

933
01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:30.747
That's just what
he wants us to do-

934
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:34.334
us to go back downstairs through his
fun house so we get all tore up.

935
01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:37.670
He's gonna call the cops! He's not
callin' the- From a tree house?

936
01:27:37.754 --> 01:27:39.631
Come on.

937
01:27:39.756 --> 01:27:42.008
Out the window?
Yeah.

938
01:27:42.133 --> 01:27:44.802
I'm not goin' out the window.
Why? Are you scared. Marv?

939
01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:47.513
Are you afraid?
Come on. Get out here.

940
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:54.020
Come on.

941
01:27:57.565 --> 01:28:02.195
<i>Come on!</i>

Come on.
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

943
01:28:08.576 --> 01:28:11.579
Let's go back. Harry.
Shut up!

944
01:28:11.663 --> 01:28:14.874
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

945
01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:17.877
<i>Shut it. Marv!</i>

946
01:28:20.254 --> 01:28:23.174
Hey. guys.

947
01:28:23.299 --> 01:28:26.094
Go back! Go back!

948
01:28:26.177 --> 01:28:27.720
Go back.
Okay.

949
01:28:51.911 --> 01:28:56.916
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way. you dope!

950
01:29:14.517 --> 01:29:19.272
- There he is!
- Hey. I'm calling the cops.

951
01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:22.275
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
He wants us to follow him.

952
01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:24.485
I got a better idea.
Come on.

953
01:29:41.419 --> 01:29:45.757
Hiya. pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

954
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.843
Get over here!

955
01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.390
What are we
gonna do to him. Harry?

956
01:29:54.474 --> 01:29:58.895
We'll do exactly what he did to us. I'm
gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

957
01:29:58.978 --> 01:30:01.147
Then we can smash his face
with an iron!

958
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:05.151
<i>I'd like to slap him right in the
face with a paint can maybe.</i>

959
01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:07.737
<i>Or shove a nail
through his foot.</i>

960
01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:11.115
I'm gonna bite off every one of
these little fingers one at a time.

961
01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:25.088
Come on. Let's get you home.
Whoa!

962
01:30:44.774 --> 01:30:48.986
Wow. This is great.

963
01:30:51.614 --> 01:30:54.450
Nice move- always
leaving the water running.

964
01:30:54.534 --> 01:30:57.829
Now we know each and every
house that you've hit.

965
01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:04.377
Hey. you know. we've been looking
for you two guys for a long time.

966
01:31:04.502 --> 01:31:07.421
Yeah. Well. remember.
we're the Wet Bandits.

967
01:31:07.547 --> 01:31:11.717
Wet Bandits. W-E-T-
Shut up! Get in the car!

968
01:31:11.801 --> 01:31:14.595
<i>Hey. come on. Come on.</i>

969
01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.140
Hands off the head. pal!
Come on!

970
01:32:12.778 --> 01:32:15.364
<i>I'm a bad parent.
I'm a bad parent.</i>

971
01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:18.451
You're not. You know. you're beating
yourself up there. you know.

972
01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:21.078
Come on. This happens. These things happen.
You know. you-

973
01:32:21.162 --> 01:32:24.582
Gee. you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at-
Look at us.

974
01:32:24.665 --> 01:32:29.128
I mean. we're on the road 48. 49 weeks out
of the year. We hardly see our families.

975
01:32:29.212 --> 01:32:32.590
- Uh. Joe over there-
Gosh. you know. he's--

976
01:32:32.673 --> 01:32:35.426
<i>He forgets his kids' names
half the time.</i>

977
01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:39.263
<i>Ziggy over there-
He doesn't even-
He's never even met his kid.</i>

978
01:32:39.347 --> 01:32:43.059
<i>Eddie-
Let's just hope none of them
write a book about him.</i>

979
01:32:43.142 --> 01:32:48.022
Tell me. have you ever gone on
vacation and left your child home?

980
01:32:50.858 --> 01:32:52.944
No.

981
01:32:53.027 --> 01:32:56.530
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

982
01:32:56.614 --> 01:32:58.824
Yeah. it was-
it was terrible too.

983
01:32:58.908 --> 01:33:02.245
You know. I was all distraught and
everything. You know. the wife and I.

984
01:33:02.328 --> 01:33:06.332
we left the little tyke there
in the funeral parlor all clay.

985
01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:10.336
All clay. You know. and we went back
at night when we came to our senses.

986
01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:13.881
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all clay with a corpse.

987
01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:16.676
Oh! Whew. yeah. He
was okay. you know.

988
01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:21.681
After six. seven weeks. you know. he
came around and started talking again.

989
01:33:21.764 --> 01:33:26.185
But he's okay. You know. they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

990
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:29.021
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
Well. you brought it up.

991
01:33:29.146 --> 01:33:32.149
I was just trying to cheer you up.
Well. I'm sorry I did.

992
01:33:58.050 --> 01:34:00.011
Mom?

993
01:34:04.557 --> 01:34:06.475
Mom?

994
01:34:09.854 --> 01:34:12.606
Mom?

995
01:34:58.319 --> 01:35:02.448

997
01:35:44.865 --> 01:35:47.660
Oh. Kevin. I'm so sorry.

998
01:36:07.179 --> 01:36:09.306
Where is everybody else?

999
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:13.519
Oh. baby. they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much. but-

1000
01:36:13.602 --> 01:36:18.190
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the
cab and drool all over you. did I?

1001
01:36:18.274 --> 01:36:20.568
I don't drool. You guys.

1007
01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:39.211
It's pretty cool that
you didn't burn the place down.

1008
01:36:39.336 --> 01:36:43.132
<i>Thanks. Buzz.</i>

1009
01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:46.135
<i>Wait a minute.
How did you guys get home?</i>

1010
01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:49.597
Oh. we took the morning flight. Remember?
The one you didn't want to wait for.

1011
01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.308
Oh. no.
Oh. thank you.

1012
01:36:52.433 --> 01:36:54.393
<i>Merry Christmas.

1013
01:36:54.477 --> 01:36:58.564
- Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

1014
01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.735

1015
01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:05.738

What a funny guy. What else did
you do while we were away?

1018
01:37:13.913 --> 01:37:16.832
