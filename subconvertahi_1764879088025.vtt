[Murray] I can totally see it.
You in Indiana.

Why not? [chuckles]

14

I know that sound is not good.

- Yeah.

You don't know what that is like.
I understand.

No. it's not that bad. It's… [exhales]

You know. I needed to lose weight anyway.

About who I've been and…

71
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:50.897
And what I've done.

72
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.153
I never should've sent you that message.

73
00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.489
You didn't know what was gonna happen.

74
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.282
I knew it'd be dangerous.

75
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.492
So did I.

76
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.452
I made this choice.

77
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:08.498
And I would choose it again.
even knowing everything that I know.

78
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.082
I would.

79
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.003
Plus. you know.
we do have that date to get to. [chuckles]

80
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.087
Remember?

81
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.298
[chuckles] "Remember"?

82
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:19.676
I've been dreaming about it.

83
00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.760
Oh. yeah?

84
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:21.678
[Hopper] Yeah.

85
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.638
I have it all planned out.

86

Pray tell.

87
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.351
I'm getting two orders
of bread sticks. Two.

Those things knock your socks off.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.938
Enzo puts some spice on 'em.

90
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.982
I don't know what it is. but it's good.

91
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.693
And you dip it in olive oil?
Forget about it.

92
00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.530
And. uh. I'm wavering on the main course
between the veal and the lasagne.

93
00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.907
But I think I gotta go
with lasagne. right?

94
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:48.162
So. you… you've been dreaming
about bread sticks and lasagne?

95
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.167
I've been on a diet of watery soup.
moldy bread. and maggots.

96
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.462
so. yeah. I've been dreaming
about bread sticks and lasagne.

97
00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.714
I mean. sue me.

99
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.218
Should I have been dreaming
about something else?

100
00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.220
You tell me.

101
00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.807
Well.

102
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:10.810
there's wine.

103
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.145
Oh. well. wine's good.

104
00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.022
I was thinking about a nice "Cheeanti."

105
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.691
- Chianti.
- Chianti. right.

106
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.028
- Then there's dessert.
- You gotta have dessert.

107
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.195
Gotta have dessert.

108
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.822
And after that?

[tender. emotional music swells]

110
00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:26.783
I don't know.

111
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.121
Use your imagination.

112
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.374
Who needs imagination?

123
00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:06.157
- Phase one.
- We meet Erica at the playground.

124
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.326
She'll signal Max and Lucas
when we're ready.

125
00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.286
- Phase two.
- Max baits Vecna.

126
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.370
He'll go after her.
which'll put him in his trance.

127
00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:14.791
- Phase three?
- Me and Eddie draw the bats away.

128

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.338
- [liquid sloshing]
- …flambé.

131
00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:24.425
Nobody moves on to the next phase
until we've all copied.

132
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:28.221
Nobody deviates from the plan.
no matter what.

133
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:29.931
Got it?

you abort.

152
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:09.197
Okay? Draw the attention of the bats.

153
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.908
Keep 'em busy for a minute or two.
We'll take care of Vecna.

154
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.660
Don't try to be cute
or be a hero or something.

155

[Eddie] Absolutely. I mean.

158
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:21.792
look at us.

159
00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.420
We are not heroes.

[Jonathan] No. no.
Like I said. I… I've tried everyone.

Yeah. TWA. Pan Am. Eastern.

169
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.156
No. it doesn't have to be a one-way.

170
00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.991
I'll take one seat. if you have it.

171
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:23.247
I mean. please.
there has to be something that you can do.

172
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.208
One of our family members
is really. really sick.

173
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.878
and I don't know
if she's gonna make it through the night.

174
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.048
Is there any way that you could just…

175

- No. No. No.
- [pensive music playing]

176
00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:37.803

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:43.684
Okay. well. is there any way
that I could speak to a manager?

178
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:47.605
There… There's no one there?

179
00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.151
No. that's the problem. I can't call back.

180
00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.779

No. I don't think that we need one.
Thank you. though.

"What are <i>you </i>doing here?"

Um. he's my boyfriend.

1961
01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:41.716
Well. <i>was</i> my boyfriend.

1962
01:59:41.799 --> 01:59:43.593
He was visiting. took one look at this.

1963
01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:46.179
and it's not what he was envisioning
for spring break.

1964
01:59:46.262 --> 01:59:48.639
He was like. "I'm outta here.
Back to Purdue. Good luck."

1965
01:59:48.723 --> 01:59:52.602
Which. ultimately. it's bordering on
a good thing. 'cause he was grating on me.

He is the type who trashes <i>Fast Times</i>

Who need… food.

1973
02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:15.458

02:00:27.803 --> 02:00:31.515
Um. it's like sometimes my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.

1979
02:00:31.599 --> 02:00:33.267
and it's like this runaway train.

1980
02:00:33.351 --> 02:00:36.437
and I cannot seem to get it to stop.
no matter how hard I try.

1981
02:00:37.355 --> 02:00:38.606
You know what I mean?

1982
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:41.859
Uh. yeah. I think I know what you mean.

1983
02:00:44.487 --> 02:00:45.571
It's a gift.

1984
02:00:45.655 --> 02:00:47.573
- Oh. for me?
- You're welcome. Mm-hmm.

1985
02:00:47.657 --> 02:00:49.784
- You really shouldn't have.
- Oh. but I did.

1986
02:00:49.867 --> 02:00:52.119
- I just don't even deserve it.
- But I did.

1987
02:00:52.203 --> 02:00:54.538
- I mean. thank you.
- Early birthday.

1988
02:00:54.622 --> 02:00:57.500
Thank you so much. Oh. oh. wow.

[Dustin] Mr. Munson?

1993
02:01:25.987 --> 02:01:27.613
I'm Dustin Henderson.

1994
02:01:27.697 --> 02:01:28.948
Can we talk?

1995
02:01:30.032 --> 02:01:32.535
I can't imagine
we got anything to talk about.

1996
02:01:34.161 --> 02:01:35.496
My nephew is innocent.

1997
02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:37.790
He's still missing.

1998
02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:41.252
I'll put up as many posters as I need
until he's found.

1999
02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.171
Good day to you.

2000
02:01:44.839 --> 02:01:45.881
I was with him.

2001
02:01:50.761 --> 02:01:52.596
I was with him when the earthquake hit.

2002

[sorrowful synth music playing]

2003
02:01:56.726 --> 02:01:59.061
And… where is Eddie now?

2004
02:02:14.952 --> 02:02:16.120
[voice quavering] I'm…

2005
02:02:16.996 --> 02:02:18.205
I'm so sorry.

[breathing shakily]

2008
02:02:53.074 --> 02:02:55.368
I wish everyone had gotten to know him.

2009
02:02:58.079 --> 02:02:59.246
Really know him.

2010
02:03:01.665 --> 02:03:03.501
Because they would've loved him.

2011
02:03:04.085 --> 02:03:05.085
Mr. Munson.

2012
02:03:06.796 --> 02:03:08.005
They would've loved him.

2013
02:03:10.299 --> 02:03:11.384
Even in the end…

2014
02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:15.638
He never stopped being Eddie.

2015
02:03:18.432 --> 02:03:20.434
Despite everything.

2016
02:03:22.978 --> 02:03:24.980
I never even saw him get mad.

2017
02:03:26.399 --> 02:03:27.566
He could've run.

2018
02:03:28.776 --> 02:03:30.986
He could've saved himself.

2019
02:03:33.406 --> 02:03:34.490
But he fought.

2020
02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:40.746
He fought and died to protect this town.

2021
02:03:41.705 --> 02:03:44.959
This town that… hated him.

2022
02:03:46.627 --> 02:03:48.295
He isn't just innocent…

2023
02:03:50.256 --> 02:03:51.507
Mr. Munson. he's…

2024
02:03:53.384 --> 02:03:54.677
He's a hero.

Holy shit.

2031
02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:55.988
This place is a total disaster.

2032

[Jonathan] Yeah.

2033
02:04:58.365 --> 02:05:00.117

[Argyle] I get we gotta hide Supergirl.

but this isn't exactly
the Fortress of Solitude. man.

2036
02:05:05.748 --> 02:05:08.501
It's more like a fortress of grodiness.

2037
02:05:08.584 --> 02:05:10.544
Come on. guys. seriously.

2038
02:05:10.628 --> 02:05:12.755
I've seen Mike's room
look worse than this.

2039
02:05:12.838 --> 02:05:14.173
[Argyle] Ah. brutal. dude.

2044
02:05:37.404 --> 02:05:39.114
[Jonathan] All right. That's good.

2045
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.991
Hold it right there.

2046
02:05:48.123 --> 02:05:50.292
What's he doing?

2047
02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.965
[Jonathan] Looks like
he's gathering mushrooms.

2048
02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:57.841
He's a little on the eccentric side.

2049
02:05:57.925 --> 02:05:59.552
Welcome to the club. right?

2050
02:05:59.635 --> 02:06:01.178

Yeah?

2054

I'm sorry I wasn't here.

Oh. I mean…

2056
02:06:15.651 --> 02:06:17.319
To be honest. I'm kinda glad you weren't.

[tender. emotional music playing]

2058
02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:22.408
I just mean. I'm glad you were with Mike.

And Will.

2060
02:06:23.951 --> 02:06:26.787
And I'm… I'm glad you were here too.

2061
02:06:27.788 --> 02:06:29.268
Otherwise. who'd have been in charge?

2062
02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.458
Steve? [chuckles]

2063
02:06:32.167 --> 02:06:36.171
He's actually grown up quite a bit.
you know?

2064
02:06:38.215 --> 02:06:39.216
Yeah.

2065
02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:40.300
Yeah. I'm sure.

Hey.

Yeah?

2068
02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:49.601
Are we okay?

2069
02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:53.104
Yeah.

2070
02:06:53.522 --> 02:06:54.940
- Yeah?
- Yeah. totally.

2071
02:06:55.691 --> 02:06:56.942
Yeah. it's… it's just…

life keeps throwing things
in the way of our big plans.

2075

Yeah. sure seems like that.

2076
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:14.168
You think it's too late to throw
"saving the world" on your college resume?

2077

Your… Your application letter…

2078

Not that it matters at all anymore. but…

2079
02:07:25.512 --> 02:07:26.764
Did it ever come?

2080
02:07:30.726 --> 02:07:32.603
No. No. uh…

2081
02:07:33.687 --> 02:07:34.687

Not much.

He says that she wasn't ready.

2089
02:08:09.264 --> 02:08:11.141
And now she's starting to think
he was right.

2090
02:08:11.225 --> 02:08:12.476
That's crap.

if she hadn't left the lab.

- Max wouldn't be alive right now.
- I know.

It's just. she's. um…

2094

She's never lost before.

2095
02:08:22.236 --> 02:08:23.278
Not like this.

2096
02:08:23.904 --> 02:08:26.115
- She'll have another chance.
- Let's hope not.

And he's hurt.

He's hurting.

2104
02:08:46.135 --> 02:08:48.011
But he's still alive.

2105
02:08:48.762 --> 02:08:53.267
It's strange. knowing now who it was
this whole time. but…

2106
02:08:54.852 --> 02:08:57.271
I can still remember what he thinks.

and<i> how</i> he thinks.

2108
02:09:01.525 --> 02:09:03.110

Ever.

2110
02:09:05.612 --> 02:09:07.781
Not until he's taken everything.

2111

And everyone.

2112
02:09:11.326 --> 02:09:12.828
