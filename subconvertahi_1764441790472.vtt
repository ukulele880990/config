and I will gladly take my life.

1049
02:20:23.877 --> 02:20:28.046
I have dreamed of a unified Japan...

1050
02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:34.044
of a country strong
and independent and modern.

1051
02:20:34.095 --> 02:20:40.009
And now we have rail roads
and cannon. Western clothing.

1052
02:20:41.853 --> 02:20:43.513
But...

1053
02:20:46.858 --> 02:20:50.985
we cannot forget who we are...

1054
02:20:52.363 --> 02:20:56.958
or where we come from.

1055
02:21:09.255 --> 02:21:11.893
Ambassador Swanbeck...

1056
02:21:12.008 --> 02:21:14.901
I have concluded that your treaty...

1057
02:21:15.011 --> 02:21:19.946
is not in the best interest
of my people.

1058
02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:24.302
- Sir. if I may...
- So sorry...

1059
02:21:24.604 --> 02:21:26.433
but you may not.

1060
02:21:26.731 --> 02:21:30.135
This is an outrage!

1061
02:21:36.074 --> 02:21:37.314
[IN JAPANESE]
Enlightened One...

1062
02:21:37.408 --> 02:21:39.110
- we should discuss this...
- Omura...

1063
02:21:39.244 --> 02:21:41.541
you have done quite enough.

1064
02:21:41.663 --> 02:21:44.301
Everything I have done.
I have done for my country.

1065
02:21:44.457 --> 02:21:47.435
Then you will not mind
when I seize your family's assets...

1066
02:21:47.669 --> 02:21:50.264
and present them
as my gift to the people.

1067
02:21:50.421 --> 02:21:52.804
You disgrace me.

1068
02:21:52.924 --> 02:21:55.349
If your shame is too unbearable...

1069
02:22:04.394 --> 02:22:05.883
I offer you this sword.

1070
02:22:36.634 --> 02:22:39.230
[IN ENGLISH]
Tell me how he died.

1071
02:22:46.936 --> 02:22:51.573
I will tell you how he lived.

1072
02:23:00.742 --> 02:23:05.251
<i>GRAHAM: And so the days
of the Samurai had ended.</i>

1073
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:10.988
<i>Nations. like men. it is sometimes said.
have their own destiny.</i>

1074
02:23:11.961 --> 02:23:14.599
<i>As for the American captain...</i>

1075
02:23:14.714 --> 02:23:17.097
<i>no one knows what became of him.</i>

1076
02:23:17.217 --> 02:23:20.747
<i>Some say that he died of his wounds...</i>

1077
02:23:20.845 --> 02:23:24.886
<i>others. that he returned
to his own country.</i>

1078
02:23:24.974 --> 02:23:26.634
<i>But I like to think</i>

1079
02:23:26.768 --> 02:23:31.958
<i>he may have at last found
some small measure of peace...</i>

1080
02:23:32.023 --> 02:23:34.065
<i>that we all seek...</i>

1081
02:23:34.776 --> 02:23:38.009
<i>and few of us ever find.</i>
