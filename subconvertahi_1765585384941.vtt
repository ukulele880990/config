Still had the offer?

Hmm.

-[Loretta screaming]

341
00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:21.798
This room is off limits.

342
00:15:24.885 --> 00:15:28.347
I'm so. so. so sorry
to scream out like that.

343
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.431
Um...

344
00:15:30.557 --> 00:15:34.394
[with Cajun accent]
Uh. it's. um. PTSD from the well.

345
00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:37.272
but I-- I won't-- I won't bore you
with the whole story.

346
00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:41.109
Name's Emily Lawler. just up here
by way of Natchitoches.

347
00:15:41.193 --> 00:15:43.654
Big change
for a little swamp girl like me.

348
00:15:43.737 --> 00:15:47.991
I was headin' on. uh. up the stairs
and I heard <i>"Vissi d'arte."</i>

349
00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:49.576
You know <i>Tosca?</i>

350
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.036
Oh. do I!

351
00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:56.208
I played the Maria Callas part
in my senior year at Lafayette.

352
00:15:56.291 --> 00:16:00.087
Is that Floria Tosca's... dagger?

353
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.464
This is the same one Maria Callas used

354
00:16:02.547 --> 00:16:05.801
in her final performance
of <i>Tosca </i>at The Met.

355
00:16:07.302 --> 00:16:09.638
-Oh...
-Isn't it wonderful?

356
00:16:09.721 --> 00:16:13.809
My husband came across it
at a police repo auction.

357
00:16:13.892 --> 00:16:15.978
-Mm.
-On our 10th anniversary.

358
00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:17.729
It was perfect!

359
00:16:19.064 --> 00:16:21.024
He died this month.

360
00:16:21.108 --> 00:16:22.109
Oh.

361
00:16:23.026 --> 00:16:24.236
My condolences.

362
00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:26.697
I lost mine this past year.

363
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.075
[normal voice]
In a fire. I lost everything.

364
00:16:30.158 --> 00:16:31.827
-[sighs] Oh.
-So...

365
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.787
[resumes Cajun accent]
Is this your lucky fella?

366
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.374
No. no. no.
I was his lucky gal.

367
00:16:37.457 --> 00:16:40.669
And we were married for 30 years.
and every night

368
00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:42.838
he would come home
and kiss me on the head.

369
00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:45.215
And then one night. no kiss and...

370
00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:48.969
he was gone.

371
00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:51.888
Yeah. he fell into the fountain

372
00:16:51.972 --> 00:16:54.433
of the courtyard where we married.

373
00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:55.517
[sighs]

374
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.310
Hmm.

375
00:16:57.394 --> 00:16:59.271
Look at that woodwork!
[laughing]

376
00:16:59.354 --> 00:17:00.897
You don't see moldings
like that no more.

377

-Oh. my God.
-Yeah. 100% pine.

378
00:17:03.233 --> 00:17:04.401
-Are you serious?
-On my mother--

379
00:17:04.484 --> 00:17:06.361
-I would not lie to you. my friend.
-Ah!

380
00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:08.155
[coughing] Listen. uh.

381
00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:12.242

what's your credit score?

383
00:17:13.744 --> 00:17:15.078
Excuse me one sec.

384
00:17:15.162 --> 00:17:17.414
I'll be right back.

-I think you'll like it.
-Look enough of this.

391
00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:43.148
We're not going to any play.
and neither are you.

392
00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:45.233
We took him in.
If he's got any free time.

393
00:17:45.317 --> 00:17:47.194
he can work at the goddamn store.

394
00:17:47.277 --> 00:17:49.863
-Ah. don't be difficult now.
-[Young Oliver sighs]

395
00:17:49.946 --> 00:17:53.033
And it'll feel good for you
to contribute to this house.

-Aw.
-Al!

397
00:17:55.535 --> 00:17:57.454

Why are you sellin'?

402
00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:09.758
I would give anything
to at least have my home

403
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.635
and my-- my stuff back.

404
00:18:11.718 --> 00:18:14.012
Yeah. I thought I'd feel
the same way. but...

405
00:18:15.097 --> 00:18:18.350
you know. I look around.
and honestly. I...

406
00:18:19.726 --> 00:18:21.770
I don't want any of this.

407
00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:23.105

Yeah.

410
00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:32.155
And. anyway. it's not like
I can afford to stay here.

411
00:18:32.239 --> 00:18:33.949
I'm even selling the dagger.

$500 for this on eBay.

-Yeah.
-Oh. Mm.

414
00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:41.123
You wouldn't want this. would you?

415
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:47.671
So. you didn't find the bag.
but you gave our suspect $500

You didn't find a bag either. [sniffles]

Uh. side note.
how much cash do you carry?

He prefers "LESTR."

438
00:19:48.106 --> 00:19:50.150
You can use "Human Lester"
for the dead one.

439
00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:54.696
Oh. speaking of. I've styled new LESTR up
a bit more dashingly than the last one.

440
00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.865
So. what do you need?
LESTR can do anything.

441

00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:25.769
Now. at the academy
they prepared us for a lot of stuff.

454

Yeah. I don't see any feathers.

Are you sure this is the right time?

464
00:20:47.707 --> 00:20:49.459
LESTR doesn't make mistakes.

465
00:20:49.542 --> 00:20:51.753
Well. I think he did.
because I was there.

466
00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.588
Were you. though? I mean.

467
00:20:53.672 --> 00:20:57.550
maybe you were just telling a story
about your celebrity friend.

468
00:20:57.634 --> 00:20:59.511
and pretend you saw
something that you didn't see

See. look.

00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:07.227

but just go slower?

-Humane fuckin' feathers.

Someone cut a chunk out of the footage.
They tampered with it.

I'll bet that's when they took the finger.

478
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.785
Which means...

479
00:21:23.868 --> 00:21:26.162
Althea was telling the truth.

are gonna go to the precinct.

-Wait a minute. sorry.

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.785

I just find it's a helpful way

00:22:16.921 --> 00:22:17.922
Or no.

505
00:22:18.006 --> 00:22:21.593
No. we should go back to her house
and wait for them there. okay?

506
00:22:21.676 --> 00:22:23.011
Oliver. what are you doing?

507
00:22:23.094 --> 00:22:24.888
I didn't think this would still be here.

508
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:26.056
What?

509
00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:28.516
[Loretta gasping]

510
00:22:29.434 --> 00:22:31.144
Just for a minute.
can I show you something?

511
00:22:31.227 --> 00:22:33.355
[Loretta] Okay. Ooh.

[door closes]

514
00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:42.322
What?

515
00:22:44.866 --> 00:22:46.743
-This is it.
-What?

516
00:22:46.826 --> 00:22:49.454
The theater that made me love theater.

517
00:22:50.413 --> 00:22:53.583
Oh. Oh. man.

518
00:22:54.584 --> 00:22:56.920
Yeah. I can...
[chuckles] I can see it.

519
00:22:57.003 --> 00:22:58.588
-[Oliver sighs]
-Little Ollie...

520

owning the spotlight. [laughing]

521
00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:04.928
Well. it wasn't exactly like that.

522
00:23:05.011 --> 00:23:06.513
No?

523
00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:09.557
I was a-- a quiet kid.

524
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:12.769
-[laughing] Yeah.
-No. it's true. I was.

525
00:23:12.852 --> 00:23:14.229
[Loretta chuckles softly]

526
00:23:14.312 --> 00:23:17.816
Bouncing from place to place.
you learn quiet is good.

527
00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:19.275
Hmm.

528
00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:21.027
If you make yourself small...

529
00:23:22.987 --> 00:23:25.365
maybe a family
will let you stay for a while.

530
00:23:25.448 --> 00:23:27.492
So. I did. and it worked.

531
00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.453
But I never...

532
00:23:31.704 --> 00:23:32.956
felt at home.

533
00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:39.129
Until one day... I stumbled into here.

534
00:23:39.212 --> 00:23:40.213
[distant children laughing]

535
00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:41.923
There were kids putting on a show...

536
00:23:42.006 --> 00:23:43.049
[kids clamoring]

537
00:23:43.133 --> 00:23:46.928
...and they were big.
and loud. and unapologetic.

538
00:23:47.011 --> 00:23:50.306
-And I-- I wanted to be just like them.
-Yeah.

539
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.766
[Oliver] They asked me
to be in their play.

540
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.976
-[Loretta] Uh-huh?
-[Oliver] Bit part.

541
00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:55.478
but being on that stage was the feeling

542
00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:58.606
that I'd been searching
for my whole life.

543
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.483
-[Loretta] Mm.
-[Oliver] I rehearsed my little butt off.

544
00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:02.569
hemmed my costume.

545
00:24:02.652 --> 00:24:06.406
But when I worked up the courage
to invite Sue and Al...

546
00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:09.868
they just...

547
00:24:13.121 --> 00:24:14.414
I quit the play.

548

[♪ soft wistful music playing]

549
00:24:20.587 --> 00:24:23.882
But on the night of the show.
I couldn't stay away.

550
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:25.675
-Mm.
-I snuck out...

551
00:24:25.758 --> 00:24:27.552
-[chuckles]
-...dressed in that costume.

552
00:24:27.635 --> 00:24:29.929
-just in case they still needed me.
-[Loretta chuckles]

553
00:24:30.555 --> 00:24:34.225

-[♪ music fades out]
-In my whole life...

557
00:24:43.985 --> 00:24:48.615
I've only really felt
like myself in two places.

558
00:24:49.866 --> 00:24:53.244
I think-- I think being back here today.

559
00:24:53.328 --> 00:24:58.291
I-- I've... I finally understand
why I'm so afraid

560
00:24:58.374 --> 00:25:00.084
-to leave the Arconia.
-Hmm.

561
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.755
I got an offer on my place.

562
00:25:03.838 --> 00:25:05.006
It's big.

563
00:25:06.508 --> 00:25:07.550
How big?

564
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.470
Late-career Brando big.

565
00:25:10.553 --> 00:25:12.597
-Oh. boy.
-Yeah.

566
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.850
A cushion.
[chuckles] Would be nice.

567
00:25:15.934 --> 00:25:16.935
Yeah.

568
00:25:18.603 --> 00:25:20.688
Oh. what am I saying?

569
00:25:20.772 --> 00:25:23.149
But then again. uh--
You know. you...

570
00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.194
What are we doing?

571
00:25:26.277 --> 00:25:27.487

-Ollie.

and you turned it
into something beautiful.

Mr. Thibideaux.

that I'm some damsel in distress.

for our big dream:
