[BLADE OF FURY]

3
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.370
As a bounty hunter.

4
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.020
I risk my life for money.

5
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.479
The world is in chaos now.

6
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.789
There are outlaws everywhere.

7
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.950
The government pays me

8
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.810
to catch the outlaws.

9
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.940
Those who do this kind of jobs are called bounty hunters.

10
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.410
You don't get it?

11
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.860
We're like businessmen.

12
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.820
And the business we do is highly risky.

13
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.640
I came to you

14
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.860
to discuss a deal with you.

15
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.090
There is a batch of goods.

16
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.410
It belongs to the government.

17
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.880
It's a batch of jewels.

18
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.150
Those who transported the goods were robbed on their way.

19
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.829
After you robbed them and killed them.

20
00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
you also killed the Persian merchants.

21
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.910
Then you pretended to be foreign merchants

22
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.500
and tried to escape to the Western Region.

23
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.570
This is such a risky move.

24
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.460
Leave the jewels here.

25
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.420
And I'll pretend we've never met.

26
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.870
This is what I want to talk to you about.

27
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.080
Are you really a bounty hunter?

28
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.810
Many bounty hunters were killed by this knife.

29
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.430
I'm not afraid of anyone.

30
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.660
Except those four.

31
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.329
Who are those four?

32
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.130
The fearless Jackal.

33
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.610
The cunning Ghost Lady.

34
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.410
The cruel Blind.

35
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.720
And the brutal Grey-Haired Master.

36
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.510
It's obvious that you're not a woman.

37
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.410
You're neither gray-haired

38
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.700
nor blind.

39
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.050
Are you Jackal?

40
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.990
I don't think we cannot reach a deal today.

41
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.590
You're crazy!

42
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.970
I am...

43
00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.909
Jackal!

44
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.880
[Jackal]

45
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.490
You're smart.

46
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.290
I was ignorant.

47
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.730
I'll give you all these goods.

48
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.730
Please let me go.

49
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.870
It's too late.

50
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.320
Jackal.

51
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.740
What the government was transporting is not jewels.

52
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.520
It's a woman being transported.

53
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.030
Let's talk.

54
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.820
Let me go.

55
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.850
That woman

56
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.450
knows a secret.

57
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.920
The secret is more valuable than jewels.

58
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.730
What's more.

59
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.659
she can be really sexy and wild.

60
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.200
What are you doing?

61
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200
What are you doing?

62
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.860
Don't kill him!

63
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.909
Oh no.

64
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.490
The wanted poster said he must be captured alive.

65
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.950
If he's dead. I won't get any bounties at all.

66
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.530
Stop.

67
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.780
You have to compensate me.

68
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.860
Let go of me!

69
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.950
You can't drink wine.

70
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.370
You don't have money.

71
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.560
You can't go there.

72
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.350
He's ahead of us again.

73
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.190
This is Chu Xiong. the notorious thief?

74
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.090
Yes.

75
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.830
How could you tell such a stupid lie?

76
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.630
She killed Chu Xiong.

77
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.110
One for one.

78
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.490
I brought her to show that I've done my job.

79
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.220
Ask her if you don't believe me.

80
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.320
You jerk!

81
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.780
It's okay if you only give me half of the agreed bounty.

82
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.990
Miss. you're right.

83
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.370
He's called Jackal.

84
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.539
Of course he's even worse than a pig or a dog.

85
00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.780
It's hard to be a human nowadays.

86
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.030
It's easier to be a pig or a dog.

87
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.830
You jerk!

88
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.059
If you don't pay me.

89
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.330
I won't leave.

90
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.059
What are you doing?

91
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.940
She can kill people.

92
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.410
She killed a notorious criminal.

93
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.880
According to the law. she'll be treated leniently.

94
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.410
She won't have to go to jail.

95
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.270
Though bad people are everywhere nowadays.

96
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.130
we still uphold justice.

97
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.910
I've done another job that can't get me paid.

98
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.910
Wait.

99
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.250
My Lord.

100
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.710
She is involved in a murder case.

101
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.840
Arrest her first.

102
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.280
She'll be interrogated.

103
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.000
Go.

104
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.170

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.780
I'm begging you.

108
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.740
Kill me. please!

109
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.700

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.420
Kill me!

115
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.740
Jackal.

116
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.660
According to the rules.

117
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.220
you won't get the bounty.

118
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.240
But I'll give you payment for your hard work.

119
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.570
Han Lu.

120
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:11.960
My Lord.

121
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.130
I'm sorry. My Lord.

122
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.380
My Lord.

123
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.130
My Lord. I'm sorry.

124
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.790
My Lord.

125
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.780
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.990
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.450
My Lord.

128
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.040
Get lost!

129
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.060
Come on.

130
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.550
Big. Big. Big.

131
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.310
I bet it's small.

132
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.410
Here.

133
00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.870
Small.

134
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.340
Let me try again.

135
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.440
Try again.

136
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.490
Again.

137
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.860
Go on.

138
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.900
I bet it's big.

139
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.890
Let's try again.

140
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.660
Sir. would you like

141
00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.990
a fresh pancake?

142
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.310
It's delicious.

143
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.790
Who let the kid in?

144
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.120
Get out!

145
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120
Get out.

146
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.620
Don't make trouble.

147
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.210
I hate kids.

148
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.830
Bad luck.

149
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.940
I don't believe I'll always be unlucky.

150
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:28.940
I bet it's all big.

151
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.290
Get lost.

152
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.820
Give me back my wallet!

153
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.780
Go away!

154
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.200
Give me back my wallet!

155
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.260
Give me my wallet!

156
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.910
-You stained my clothes.
-Give me back my wallet!

157
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.410
I'll take the money as your compensation to me.

158
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.420
Give me back my wallet!

159
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.410

Wine!

163
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.780
Give me wine.

164
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.020
-Wine.
-Pull him away!

165
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.170
Beat him!

166
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.430
Hit him hard!

167
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.840
Hit him hard!

168
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.700
Who are you?

169
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.410
What are you waiting for?

170
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.280
Beat him!

171
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.200
Get lost!

172
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.210
Run.

173
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.340
Xing?

174
00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.670
Wine.

175
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.660
It's really you.

176
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.060
I want wine.

177
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.750
I told you I had seen him today.

178
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.220
Wine.

179
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.440
Pei Xing.

180
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.990
We haven't heard anything from you for so long.

181
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.530
I didn't expect to see you here.

182
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.330
I'm drinking. Don't interrupt.

183
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.110
We are working for Lord Guo now.

184
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.160
We're here on a mission.

185
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.410
Wine.

186
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.240
When you're sober.

187
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.480
find me in the Flower Villa of Mount Wuzi.

188
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.840
Again.

189
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.670
Sir.

190
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.230
Come.

191
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.530
My Lord. I was interrogating her.

192
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.200
Take her away.

If you're willing to be loyal to me.

381
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.130
I'll appreciate it.

382
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.250
You misunderstood.

383
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.850
I'm here to negotiate.

384
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.430
I'm a businessman.

385
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.360
But I've been unlucky lately.

386
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.180
I lost my business

387
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.020
because of you.

388
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.600
Han Lu.

389
00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.140
I misunderstood?

390
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:03.990
Pei Xing.

391
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.240
It's about a child. right?

392
00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.050
How much do you know about it?

393
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.320
I guess

394
00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.750
you know I’m from the Prime Minister's Mansion.

395
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.570
The prime minister is old.

396
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.120
But he got a son recently.

397
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:36.810
It was great news for him.

398
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.530
But that crazy woman

399
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.409
stole the child

400
00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.540
when the child was not even a month old.

401
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.320
This is a family disgrace.

402
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.570
It will damage the reputation of the prime minister.

403
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.380
I help the prime minister solve problems

404
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.820
so I have to think carefully about everything.

405
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.250
If I did anything that harmed you.

406
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.280
please forgive me.

407
00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.030
You know where the child is?

408
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.320
Ten days.

409
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.800
I will bring you the child

410
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.840
in ten days.

411
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.910
Why ten days?

412
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.030
The time for me to finish my job is never longer than ten days.

413
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.750
Your purpose is...

414
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.030
Take back my arrest order.

415
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.670
If you fail.

416
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.650
I'd like to become a wolf's food.

417
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:23.740
Deal.

418
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.700
You're free.

419
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.490
But remember.

420
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.760
you only have ten days.

421
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.120
Wait.

422
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.180
I know what kind of person you are.

423
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.300
This is a little gift for you.

424
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.420
I'll wait for the good news.

425
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.510
Stop chasing.

426
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.870
Jackal's arrest order has is taken back for now.

427
00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.040
Who do you think you are?

428
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:36.230
How do you know it's about a child?

429
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.440
It was my guess. I took a risky bet.

430
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.190
You had never won a bet before.

431
00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.920
But this time. you did.

432
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.630
That woman just wanted to die.

433
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.560
She must be protecting something.

434
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.240
What's the thing that's more important than her life?

435
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.880
You never got involved anything related to women or children.

436
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.650
How come

437
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.530
this time?

438
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.710
I can't forget her eyes.

439
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.810
Kill me!

440
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.470
Kill me!

441
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:08.910
Kill me!

442
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.300
Kill me!

443
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.070
Don't kill my child.

444
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.850
What's your plan?

445
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.140
I need to know

446
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.530
every place she went to

447
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.660
and every person she met

448
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.130
before she was caught.

449
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.060
The sooner you give me the information. the better.

450
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.320
Lord Guo's is such a powerful official.

451
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.280
We're no match for him.

452
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.370
If he goes back on his word...

453
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.740
I know his secret.

454
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.690
He doesn't dare to hurt me.

455
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.040
I didn't want to get you involved.

456
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.660
But I really can't find anyone else.

457
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.410
You can refuse to help me.

458
00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:54.530
I know the money...

459
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.530
Enough.

460
00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.370
What will happen in ten days

461
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:59.410
is out of my hands.

462
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.030
You're indeed a famous tracker among the bounty hunters.

463
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.910
You came ahead of me.

464
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.450
Shadow-erasing. you won't be able to profit from the job alone.

465
00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.710
[Shadow-erasing]

466
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.950
Have you seen her?

467
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.660
Don't be afraid.

468
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.530
According to Sanya.

469
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.050
a woman gave her the child and left.

470
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.070
She threw a mirror to her as a reward.

471
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.410
The woman said she would come back to pick up this child.

472
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.530
Sanya went out every day to wait for that woman.

473
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.280
Finally. you are here.

474
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280
You'd better

475
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.110
take the child away right now.

476
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.240
To raise my own children

477
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.440
is already extremely difficult for me.

478
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.520
You can't hug a child like this.

479
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.750
What kind of father are you?

480
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.700
Go with your father.

481
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.710
Be good.

482
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:00.980
Wait.

483
00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.120
Take it with you.

484
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.890
This is the treasure the child's mother left for her child.

485
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.260
I can't keep it.

486
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.780
Be good.

487
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.160
Bao.

488
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.620
Bao?

489
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.630
I gave the child the random name.

490
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.720
Every child is the most precious in their parents' eyes.

491
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.210
Take the food. You can eat it on your way.

492
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.070
Remember to chew them into pieces and feed the baby.

493
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.520
Can you stop crying?

494
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.340
No.

495
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.070
No!

496
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.020
Kill me!

497
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.120
Kill me!

498
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.120
Kill me?

499
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.670
So you're what enables me to have a good sleep?

500
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:39.230
[To Jackal]

501
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.460
The bounty hunter hired by Wu Shao'an is you.

502
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:50.860
Guo Zhongxiang

503
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.270
is the butler in the Prime Minister's Mansion

504
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:53.780
He has humble origins.

505
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.610
He took his mother's surname Guo.

506
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.980
He is the illegitimate son of the prime minister.

507
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.900
He is born to be a very patient and person.

508
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.550
And he is meticulous and vicious.

509
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:05.410
He’s in charge of the dirty business in the mansion.

510
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.270
The prime minister is old.

511
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.750
And his main wife doesn't bear any child.

512
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.530
The dancer Liu Zhen gave birth to a son for the prime minister.

513
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.140
The fortune-teller said the son was born to be extraordinary.

514
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.550
The prime minister got very happy upon hearing it.

515
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.080
But this caused conflicts among the different groups of people in the mansion.

516
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.090
Liu Zhen escaped from the capital

517
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.910
to save herself and her son.

518
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.330
Guo Zhongxiang is under the prime minister's order to find the child.

519
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.730
But in fact. he plotted to kill him.

520
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.890
He has always dreamed of being the lawful heir of the prime minister

521
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.530
and he believed in the evil magic of sorcerers in the Western Region.

522
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.320
He planned to sacrifice the baby on the full-moon night of this month

523
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.150
and make the baby into a pill and eat it.

524
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.030
He hopes to get the child's fortunate by doing that.

525
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:41.950
He has gone so crazy

526
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.580
that he's worse than a beast.

527
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:53.950
Wait for me here.

528
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.440
Go in and report.

529
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:06.030
Leave the child to me.

530
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.090
Let's go.

531
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.100
If you don't leave. I'll leave.

532
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.540
You'll have us killed.

533
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.320
Do one last thing for me.

534
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.540
A new identity

535
00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:09.350
with a new face.

536
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.670
I want to see this baby grow up.

537
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.610
Bao.

538
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:51.060
Didn't you hate kids the most?

539
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.900
I still hate them now.

540
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:56.210
Close your eyes.

541
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.340
Sleep for a while.

542
00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.090
You'll be fine when you wake up.

543
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.880
It seems to be the time for him to pee.

544
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:05.700
Don't worry.

545
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:08.490
I'm better at taking care of babies than you.

546
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.580
In such a turbulent world.

547
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.810
it is by no means easy

548
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.230
for ordinary people like us to live.

549
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.600
I live on the top of the mountain

550
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.620
to stay away from troubles.

551
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:24.800
Even if I will live with no dignity.

552
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.120
I don't want to go back to the nightmare of the past.

553
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:33.370
But these days.

554
00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.170
I feel extremely anxious.

555
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.530
Why don't we stay away from this troubled place

556
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:44.960
and start a new life?

557
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.060
You even killed a child.

558
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:52.840
Bastard!

559
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.050
The traitor must be executed.

560
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.250
Pei Xing.

561
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.580
This is your honor.

562
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.270
No!

563
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.670
Don't kill my child!

564
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:33.910
No!

565
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.490
Don't kill my child!

566
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.660
If you want to kill someone. kill me!

567
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.590
No!

568
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.800
No!

569
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.530
Kill me!

570
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.160
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

571
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.230
Open your eyes and look carefully.

572
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.360
On the battlefield.

573
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.370
only by turning into a beast

574
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.290
can you live.

575
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.410
I want to add another person.

576
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.590
If I don't come back before dawn.

577
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.050
find a good family for this child.

578
00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:56.910
Everyone has his own fate.

579
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:59.530
Is it worth taking risks

580
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.860
for a woman whom you don't know?

581
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.240
Who knows?

582
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.930
Another loss.

583
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.430
Liu Zhen is imprisoned here.

584
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.230
I am sure of it.

585
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.530
The Shadow-erasing must have cost you a lot.

586
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:20.720
It's worthwhile.

587
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:22.440
I will write a report

588
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.190
to expose Guo Zhongxiang's evil deeds to the court.

589
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.870
I will bring him to justice

590
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.550
even if it will be at the cost of my career.

591
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.750
This place is usually heavily guarded.

592
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:32.910
I think they're all gone tonight.

593
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:33.700
So strange.

594
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.260
Why are you helping me?

595
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.060
I want you to know

596
00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.070
that there's humaneness in this world.

597
00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.600
Where there's humaneness. there's justice.

598
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.500
Stay alive.

599
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.350
There are more people in this world who need you.

600
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:55.890
Wait for me here.

601
00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.030
Jackal.

602
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.050
I haven't known your real name yet.

603
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.160
Is that important?

604
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.540
I should call you by your real name.

605
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.000
I'll tell you next time we meet.

606
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.630
[Prostitute]

607
00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:01.410
"Don't you see the mirror bright in chamber high

608
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.660
which grieves over your snow-white hair that once was silken black?"

609
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.640
I was wondering why there was no guard here.

610
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.730
It turns out that the big boss is here.

611
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.920
It's hard for us to meet.

612
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:32.280
We shouldn't be disturbed by others.

613
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.320
What do you think?

614
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.550
They even hired the Grey-Haired Master. who ranks first among all bounty hunters.

615
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.330
I am so proud of myself.

616
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.500
[Grey-Haired Master]

617
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.810
Try it.

618
00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.220
Good wine.

619
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.850
Good pot.

620
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.450
You came to save her?

621
00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.520
What's your relationship with her?

622
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.420
Nothing.

623
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.890
There must be a reason.

624
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.580
What about you?

625
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.420
I'm a bounty hunter.

626
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.780
I never ask anything about right or wrong.

627
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.310
Jackal.

628
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.630
You broke the rules.

629
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.650
Looks like

630
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.820
we have to fight.

631
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.400
You haven't returned the pot to me.

632
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.160
It's been a long time since I played so happily.

633
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.270
Alright.

634
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.370
We're almost done.

635
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.070
Stop running.

636
00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:29.120
I can't catch up with you.

637
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.240
Jackal.

638
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.620
Let's end it.

639
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.290
I'm curious

640
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.990
why Jackal. the best businessman.

641
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:31.450
would turn against the powerful Prime Minister

642
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:36.090
for a child.

643
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:40.420
I want to find out

644
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.190
what's wrong with you.

645
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.370
Then what have you found out?

646
00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:51.280
You are completely different from who you were.

647
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:55.090
I envy you.

648
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.630
As a martial artist.

649
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.540
I've thought of countless ways to die.

650
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.520
It's not bad

651
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.170
to die here today.

652
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.860
Actually. we all live in a big coffin.

653
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:22.920
The only difference is the time of death.

654
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:31.240
"I can't condescend to serve celebrities."

655
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:39.660
"That will make me lose my hearty smile."

656
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.900
Liu Zhen.

657
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.880
My baby.

658
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.880
Where is my baby?

659
01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:28.060
Don't worry. The baby is safe.

660
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:23.140
I want you to see

661
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.240
that there's humaneness in this world.

662
01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.770
Where there's humaneness. there's justice.

663
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.660
Forgive me.

664
01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:44.310
I have no choice.

665
01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240
Pei Xing.

666
01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.570
You fell behind.

667
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:32.280
Captain.

668
01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.460
You fell behind too.

669
01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:57.440
It's impossible for him to survive.

670
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.420
I want to see the body.

671
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:00.740
Yes.

672
01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.030
Prepare everything for the sacrifice ceremony.

673
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.910
The county governor Wu Shao'an and Jackal tried to rebel

674
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:30.120
and were executed on the spot.

675
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.780
I will put up a notice.

676
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.320
I'll do it perfectly.

677
01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.970
Perfectly.

678
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.880
You know too much.

679
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:41.660
Guo... Guo...

680
01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.590
You smell so good.

681
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.510
Why are you so excited to see me?

682
01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:05.140
Hurry up.

683
01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:13.440
Have you found the body?

684
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.200
I'll report to Captain Han.

685
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.960
How come that you went through so much trouble

686
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.400
because of Jackal?

687
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.360
Even Captain Han

688
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.970
seems to be afraid of him.

689
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.780
You don't know how scary he is.

690
01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.160
He...

691
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.320
He's known as the "Undead Jackal."

692
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.180
I just want to stay alive.

693
01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:08.240
You knew that we couldn't afford to offend them.

694
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.540
but you got all of us involved.

695
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.460
Look at what they have done to me!

696
01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:18.430
I don't want to go back to the past.

697
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.840
When you went to save an outsider.

698
01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:26.000
did you think about what I would suffer?

699
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:32.550
Where is Wu Shao'an?

700
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.100
I will release his soul from purgatory.

701
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:47.360
My name is

702
01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.450
Pei Xing.

703
01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.110
Where are you going?

704
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.040
I know

705
01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.480
that as long as you stay away from me.

706
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.840
you will have many ways to escape.

707
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.420
But you didn't choose that way.

708
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.400
Stay alive.

709
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:21.030
I know the sword that Captain Han uses.

710
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:24.080
No one can survive from that sword.

711
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:26.500
It's the Sword of the Universe.

712
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.710
It once belonged to Bai Qi. the Greatest General.

713
01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.600
The altar has been built.

714
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.610
How do we deal with the farmers?

715
01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:49.210
Those who are involved

716
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.410
must die.

717
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:51.310
Got it.

718
01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.330
[Pei Xing's Tomb]

719
01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:14.590
Han Lu.

720
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.439
I will repay you

721
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:19.410
after this.

722
01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:21.319
Thank you. Lord Guo.

723
01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.250
I admire you

724
01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:26.500
because we are alike.

725
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.630
Just remember don't pry into too much.

726
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:31.990
As long as you are by my side.

727
01:08:32.569 --> 01:08:33.779
I will help you

728
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.840
achieve your ambition.

729
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.090
Remember.

730
01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:44.130
When the rain stops

731
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.490
at midnight.

732
01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:47.359
the elixir will be made.

733
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:52.890
I'll escort you.

734
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:42.520
What are you doing here?

735
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.140
Pei Xing.

736
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:51.670
Stop being stubborn.

737
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.420
Can't you just be a bounty hunter?

738
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.040
Why are you against us?

739
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.360
Look.

740
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:57.030
It's not easy

741
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.370
for us to reach this far.

742
01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:00.190
Are you going to ruin us?

743
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.330
I've been a bounty hunter for seven years.

744
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.990
I've been working for others all the time.

745
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:11.110
Today.

746
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.610
I'll do things for myself.

747
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.350
Step back if you want to live.

748
01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:24.620
I don't want to see the blood of my friends.

749
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.540
Soldiers

750
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.750
can never retreat.

751
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:59.400
You go now.

752
01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:17.450
What's the point of living

753
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:19.770
when I cannot do anything right?

754
01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.380
The soldiers that Han Lu led

755
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.420
are not capable at all.

756
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.390
Just consider it as honing their skills for Lord Guo.

757
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.440
You and Han Lu are somewhat alike.

758
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.490
But the difference is

759
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:44.440
Han Lu never stabbed anyone in the back.

760
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:46.800
It would be a huge disgrace

761
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.010
if I were killed by you.

762
01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.160
Killing is killing.

763
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.620
There's no need to judge the method.

764
01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.160
That's what you can do?

765
01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.820
I'm so disappointed.

766
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.150
Please.

767
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:40.850
Please spare me.

768
01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.500
Please.

769
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.340
Please spare me.

770
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.150
Please spare me.

771
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.070
Good boy.

772
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:13.930
Bao.

773
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.870
You really want to die.

774
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.370
This time.

775
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.810
I want to live.

776
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:33.830
Stand up.

777
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.660
Aren't you the "Undead Jackal?"

778
01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:39.990
I gave you a chance.

779
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:41.580
but you didn't cherish it.

780
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.900
We almost died.

781
01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:45.870
What was it for?

782
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.100
For the lavish life of those high-ranking officials?

783
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:53.590
We survived from piles of dead bodies.

784
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.110
We deserve a better life.

785
01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:00.130
Look at you now.

786
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.780
You live like a street dog.

787
01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.590
You are street dogs.

788
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:09.220
It seems

789
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.470
you've forgotten

790
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:13.150
what you did before.

791
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:15.940
I'll help you remember.

792
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.350
Do you remember them?

793
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.460
You...

794
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:30.280
Don't you like saving people?

795
01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.900
Fine.

796
01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:35.980
Open your eyes and take a look.

797
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.180
They

798
01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:43.400
will die because of you.

799
01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.450
Both of us are demons.

800
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:54.730
If Buddhas won't save me.

801
01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.380
I'll save myself.

802
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.310
Don't you want to save the kid?

803
01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.250
I'll kill him now.

804
01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:21.480
Let him go.

805
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:27.000
No!

806
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.430
You are really hard to kill.

807
01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.170
However.

808
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:44.570
bro.

809
01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.190
that's enough.

810
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.860
Be a smart man in the next life.

811
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:44.730
Frost. blood and blade.

812
01:21:58.450 --> 01:22:00.490
Pei Xing.

813
01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:23.290
Come here.

814
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.950
He seems happy to see you.

815
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:36.620
Can I call this brotherhood?

816
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:44.350
Let me hug you.

817
01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:53.220
Do you deserve it?

818
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.790
Please.

819
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:12.970
Please let me go.

820
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:14.500
I beg you.

821
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.330
I can give you whatever you want.

822
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:18.380
Please.

823
01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:21.810
You know who's behind me.

824
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:24.370
I'm the only one who can withdraw

825
01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.550
I'm here on behalf of Liu Zhen.

826
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:30.060
No. No. No.

827
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:39.420
It stinks.

828
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.980
Pei Xing.

829
01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:46.270
Don't think you can leave.

830
01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.700
From now on.

831
01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:52.650
all bounty hunters in the world

832
01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:54.870
will try to kill you.

833
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:56.780
From now on.

834
01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.040
you have no chance to live a peaceful life

835
01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:00.120
until

836
01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.820
your head falls.

837
01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:25.950
Kid.

838
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:29.530
There are two roads ahead.

839
01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:34.890
One is a broad road to the capital

840
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:37.330
where you can find your glory and wealth.

841
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:43.320
The other is a path to the turbulent world.

842
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:46.480
You need to stay with me to the end of the world.

843
01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:50.710
It's up to you.

844
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:11.940
[Wine]

845
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:13.200
Here comes the wine.

846
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.280
Sir.

847
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:16.420
Please enjoy your wine.

848
01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.020
Call me if you need anything.

849
01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.050
[Wanted]

850
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:45.580
[Xie Miao as Blind Cheng]
