people convalesce at the beach.

11
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:48.850
[passenger] You'll complain
about sand getting everywhere.

12
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.117
[driver] I'll be happy.

13
00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.053

The Rockies are cozy. [stutters] The
cold isn't bitter there. It's warm.

17
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.502
Cold is just cold. Joan.

18
00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.871
It's the kind of place
you could spend forever.

It's 84 degrees in Naples today.

20

- Florida.
- We're not Florida people. Larry.

22
00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.147
Oh. God. Joan. that sounds so snobby.

- We're not Florida people.
- [groans]

24
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.953
[stammering] You know.
you sound like Karen.

25
00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:27.755
Karen is my friend. and she is not well.

26
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.726
Well. we don't have to make people into
saints ju-just because they're dying.

27
00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:34.028
Jesus. Larry.

28
00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:36.965
Look. it's got mountains
and ice and snow.

29
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.568
So many things for you to
complain about. You will love it.

30
00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:44.204
I don't love to complain.
That's not something people love.

31
00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.708
I don't want to fight. It's a big day.

32
00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.811
You know. people die at these
things? I saw it on the Internet.

33
00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:52.479
It's a gender reveal party.

34
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.016
I mean. I get eliminating
the surprise...

35
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.151
- Can we just let them make a fuss?
- ...but it's not party-worthy.

36
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.489
You know. one of the great joys of my
life has been allowing for surprises.

37
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.359
- Do you... Do you remember...
- Everything has to be a party nowadays.

38
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.795
...when you were convinced
that Zach would be a girl?

39
00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.197
- Everything has to be an event.
- You just don't like parties.

40
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.000
No. No. you just hate having fun.

41
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.435
- Kids have preschool graduations now.
- You're only happy when you're miserable.

42
00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.404
You're five. You don't know anything.

43
00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:21.174
- Look. I... Can we just enjoy it? Okay?
- But. you know. you have the big party.

44
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.343
- Big party.
- Larry!

45
00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.445

47
00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.218

- [sighs]

49
00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:34.856
Joan.

50

63
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.665
- This is gonna be a boy.
- How do you know that?

64
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:21.435
- Because it's so low. A boy.
- [chuckles]

65
00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:23.938
So. coming up on 65 years
of marriage. Any tips?

66
00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:26.239
You burst one of those balloons
and you'll never find out!

67
00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.709
[Larry chuckles]

68
00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.577

old pictures in the basement.

70
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.514
Thanks. sweetie.

71
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:35.116
[Sam] Who is that?

72
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.651
[kid] Pop-pop was in the army?

73
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.555
[woman] No. sweetie. That was Nana's
stupidly attractive first husband.

74
00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.957
Jesus Christ. he's a dapper man.

75
00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:44.391
Why would you leave him for Pop-pop?

76
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.226
[clicks tongue] No. sweetie.

77
00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.731

[Sam] Lar. you got
really lucky. my friend.

79
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.670
- I bet he would have been a good dad.
- [Larry choking]

[train brakes squealing]

95

- Your afterlife coordinator.

142
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.587
That's not a job.

143
00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:35.056
You've passed away. Larry.

144
00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:36.324
No.

145
00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:37.391
You're dead.

146
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.094
No. I'm not. I-I hit my head. And...

147
00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:42.396
It's a girl.

148
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.831
[chuckles] Walk with me.

149
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.402
Oh. All right. listen. So I
was sitting with my family.

150
00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:49.870
- and then I. uh--
- Died.

151
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.006
No. and I... Whatever
you're trying to pro...

152
00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:54.474
It's not sore. Weird.

153
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:55.776
Look. Larry.

154
00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.447
How is this happening?

155
00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:03.084
When you get here. your form
reverts to its happiest self.

156
00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:04.151
It could be any age.

157
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.987
That's why there are
lots of 10-year-old boys.

158
00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:07.655
but not a lot of teenagers though.

159
00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:10.490
Ah. shit. Joan. Joan. my wife.
I need... I need to go back.

160
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:13.227
Oh. Larry. Look on the bright side.
At least your penis works again.

161
00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:14.662
- [passerby] Hey. Anna.
- My...

162
00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:16.797
[whispers] My penis always worked.

163
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.166
There's no need to feel
shame here. We've seen it all.

164
00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:21.302
Uh. Yeah. Well. if I was dead.

165
00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:24.405
I wouldn't really care about
the functionality of my...

166
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.906
- Penis.
- [passerby 2] Ugh.

167
00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:29.043
I wouldn't be embarrassed and
annoyed with you right now.

168
00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:32.413
because you're not supposed
to be annoyed in heaven.

169
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.216
Oh. they tell you such
strange things down there.

170
00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:37.952
Larry. what is a soul?

171
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:40.755
Uh...

172
00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:45.626
I don't know. I suppose it's
the perfect version of yourself.

173
00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.862
No. It's just you.

174
00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.565
No. that can't be right.

175
00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:53.167
If you were annoyed a lot in life.

176
00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:54.802
Larry. then you might be
annoyed a lot in death.

177
00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.537
Were you annoyed a lot in life. Larry?

178
00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.005
Listen to me. My wife
really needs me right now.

179
00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.673
I'm sorry. It doesn't work like that.

180
00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:02.676
Wake up. Larry. Wake up. Wake
up. Come on. buddy. Come on.

181
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:04.845
What the hell is that?

182
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.847
If you were dreaming. you
wouldn't feel that pain.

183
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.517
[stammers] I didn't feel that.

184
00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:11.018
You know. usually you old fellas really
cheer up about the whole penis thing.

185
00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:13.421
Listen to me. I need to talk to
God. okay? That's what I want.

186
00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:16.090
- I want to speak with the big guy.
- Okay. so you're one of those.

187
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.858
I don't know why you didn't
say that in the first place.

188
00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.226
We got tons of eternities.

189
00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.929
What are you. New Testament.
Old Testament? Hindu. Buddhist?

190
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.798
- Pick your poison.
- Hold on. Is God not real?

191
00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:25.132
I don't know. But. listen.

192
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.068
after a couple hundred years
in one of these eternities.

193
00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:28.869
you won't even know the difference.

194
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.305
Who do you work for?

195
00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:32.541
I work for Frank.

196
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.241
Okay. then. uh. who does Frank work for?

197
00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:37.178
Frank works for Tom. Why-Why
does it even matter? Come on.

198
00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:40.214
We don't have time. I got
other clients. Larry. please.

199
00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:41.282
[sighs]

200
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:43.617
Okay. Well.

201
00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:48.222
I'm sorry for assuming that paradise
would look a little less like life.

202
00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:49.390
This isn't paradise.

203
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.426
This is just a brief transition
between life and eternity.

204
00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:54.829
Oh. you've earned a
life worth an eternity.

205
00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:57.598
- I have?
- It's just something we say.

206
00:09:57.698 --> 00:09:59.300
Everybody gets an eternity.

207
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.102
The good. the bad and the ugly.

208
00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:04.171
So all that "live a good life"
stuff's a-a bunch of crap?

209
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.239
Afraid so.

219
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.500
For now. until you choose
the right eternity for you.

220
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:34.101
But we'll get into all that later.

221

Hi. there.

Hi.

242
00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.520
Confusing time. huh?

243
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.189
- [chuckles]
- Yes. actually.

244
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.629
Oh. S-Sorry. I'm... I'm married.

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.164
What if I. uh. told you

247
00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:47.001
I could secure you a spot
in the hottest eternity...

248
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:50.538
Marge. You know the policy.
No selling in the bar.

249
00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:54.341
No selling in the bar.

250
00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:02.416
Something strong. please.

251
00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:03.851
First day?

252
00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.087
So what are you. like
an angel or something?

253
00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:08.122
Oh. no. no.

254
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:10.291
I'm a bartender.

255
00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:13.427
Oh. shit. Do I have to get a job?

256
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.697
Only if you want to stay here.

257
00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:19.867
So what are you thinking about.
for where you want to go from here?

258
00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:23.571
[coughs] Oh.

259
00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:26.775
[stammers] I don't... I don't know.

260
00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:29.544
Somewhere sunny with a beach. I guess.

261
00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:33.147
But my wife won't like that.
so I can't stay for long.

262
00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:36.150
Did your AC go over the rules?

263
00:13:36.584 --> 00:13:38.285
No. but. uh. she seemed busy.

264
00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:40.087
All right. Well. look. the big thing

265
00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:42.356
is there's no switching
eternities after you've chosen.

266
00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:44.726
No visiting other
eternities. no nothing.

267
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.827
Eternity is eternity.

268
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.596
It's forever.

269
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:52.032
What if I didn't go along with the rules?
What are they gonna do. kill me again?

270
00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:53.867
Technically they can't kill you again.

271
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.202
But you break a rule.

272
00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:58.405
you overstay your welcome. or
you try switching eternities.

273
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.608
they'll put you into the void.

274
00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:02.476
Is that like hell?

275
00:14:02.577 --> 00:14:03.844
As close as there is.

276
00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.549
It's just blackness. for eternity.

277
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:10.918
Um...

278
00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:15.856
My wife has cancer. It's terminal.

279
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.626
I'm sorry to hear that.

280
00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:22.262
Worst part about death is the guilt
you feel for the ones you left behind.

281
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.966
I know. and I told her that I
was always gonna take care of her.

282
00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.069
And now she's sick. and
dealing with all this.

283
00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.205
Um... Could I get a mixer with that?

284
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.973
That is absolutely disgusting.

285
00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:38.479
Morning. sleepyhead.

286
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.880
Morning. sweetie.

287
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.250
[inhales deeply. exhales]

288
00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.353
[snorts] What the hell?

289
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.355
What's going on? How
did you get in here?

290
00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:50.525
- Larry. you don't remember?
- Remember what?

291
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.661
No. we didn't. Did we?

292
00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:55.797
Nah. I'm just joking. I have a key.

293
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.431
- Why do you have a key?
- It's not important.

294
00:14:57.532 --> 00:15:00.434
So. you seemed to have
a good time last night.

295
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:03.370
I'm dead. You wouldn't think
hangovers would be a thing.

296
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.006
I know. right? It's a
common misconception.

297
00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:08.909
[sighs] I got a question.

298
00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.545
Mm-hmm. Hit me with it.

299
00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:13.280
[groans. sniffs]

300
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.984
So. everyone working here. they don't
want to go to their eternity. Why?

301
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:20.020
Some people haven't accepted death.

302
00:15:20.522 --> 00:15:23.457
and some people are waiting
for their loved ones.

303
00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:24.726
Oh.

304
00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:28.696
And others haven't decided yet.
and those are the worst ones.

305
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.365
Well. why did you stay?

306
00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:34.736
[chuckles] That is a
story for another time.

307
00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:36.671
- Mmm.
- So. tell me.

308
00:15:37.404 --> 00:15:39.373
Where you going? Did you decide?

309
00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:45.045
No. I... I need to see where Joan is.

310
00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:47.615
- Mmm.
- How can I tell how close she is?

311
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:50.518
No. I'm sorry. It doesn't work
like that. I can't do that.

312
00:15:50.618 --> 00:15:53.621
So all that looking down from above
stuff. that's just a bunch of BS?

313
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.289
Mmm. You're annoyed?

314
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.825
- No. I'm not annoyed.
- You look annoyed.

315
00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:59.059
What about everybody who died
before me? Where's my parents?

316
00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.360
How do I see them?

317
00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.896
You could definitely
go see your parents.

318
00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.231
But then. you know.
you'd be... [mutters]

319
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:06.634
- Be with my parents for eternity.
- Eternity.

320
00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:10.872
That's why we usually
recommend for you to do you.

321
00:16:11.606 --> 00:16:14.107
And just know that everyone
is existing pretty damn good.

322
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:15.442
You know what I mean?

323
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.082
You know. Joan always thought of death

324
00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.853
as one more surprise
waiting around the corner.

325
00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:26.554
- Mmm.
- And she loved surprises.

326
00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:28.222
But she was a librarian though. right?

327
00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:29.924
Yeah. they can like surprises too.

328
00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:31.191
Oh.

329
00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:34.629
So if I wanted to wait.
what do I have to do?

330
00:16:34.729 --> 00:16:36.163
Get a job? Be a bartender?

331
00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:39.132
No. You wish. [chuckles]
It's cleaning work.

332
00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:41.468
- Do you know how to do laundry?
- Yeah.

333
00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.138
At least the room is nice.

334
00:16:45.974 --> 00:16:48.910
Yeah. But it's for clients.

335
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.980
So if you don't decide. then you
have to go... [clicking tongue]

336
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.280
Well. I was told there is no hell.

337
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.950
- The basement.
- Oh.

338
00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:58.051
The rooms are more
functional in the basement.

339
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.354
- Mmm.
- Jesus. you went straight to hell.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:32.887
[Larry] It could be tomorrow.

347

[Anna] Or she could hang on for
another. what. six or seven months?

348
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:38.726
I mean. I guess I could
set everything up for her.

349
00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:41.896
And I could. you know. make sure
it's... it's how she likes it.

350
00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:43.831
really make it feel like a home.

351
00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:46.233
Larry. that is so romantic.

352
00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:50.270
- I guess it is a little romantic.
- [clicks tongue] It's so romantic.

353
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.740
- I can be romantic.
- I... [whimpers]

354
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.543

- You do.

- Yeah. sure can do.

365
00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.801
No can do. That's against the rules.

366
00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:55.837

letter when you got me?

now. so--

So. who are you?

418

Okay. honey. So listen. now we
finally get to have that holiday.

419
00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.153
And basically we can go anywhere
we want. but then that's it.

420
00:21:25.253 --> 00:21:27.789
It's like a one and done thing
here. They're very strict on that.

421
00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:29.824
Um. and if you want to go
to the mountains we can.

422
00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:33.094
because the snow and the cold's not
gonna kill you now. 'cause you're dead.

423
00:21:33.194 --> 00:21:35.096
- Back away from my client.
- I'm not near your client.

424
00:21:35.196 --> 00:21:36.531
- Back away.
- Shut up.

425
00:21:36.631 --> 00:21:38.431

golden goose for 67 goddamn years.

- Hi.

- I'm so sorry about her.

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:43.104

429
00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:45.305
[inhales sharply] I'm Ryan.
I'm your afterlife coordinator.

430
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:46.439
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

431
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.609
I know this can be
very. very overwhelming.

432
00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:50.511
It's a lot to absorb. so
I highly recommend just...

433
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:55.016
[inhales deeply] ...taking a deep breath
in. and... [exhales deeply] ...out.

434
00:21:55.116 --> 00:21:57.018
Just breathe out.

435
00:22:31.085 --> 00:22:32.452
Oh. Hey. What's going on. guy?

436
00:22:32.553 --> 00:22:34.288
This was my. uh. bartender.

437
00:22:34.387 --> 00:22:37.424
I. um. guess I forgot to pay the tab.
I didn't realize there would be a tab.

438
00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:38.826
Nobody gave me any money.

439
00:22:39.894 --> 00:22:42.663
No way.

440
00:22:42.763 --> 00:22:44.632
Sorry. I forgot to ask your
name. What's your name again?

441
00:22:44.732 --> 00:22:46.133
I'm Luke.

442
00:22:46.234 --> 00:22:47.735
This is Luke. He's my bartender.

443
00:22:49.003 --> 00:22:50.437
Joan.

444
00:22:51.005 --> 00:22:52.139
Oh. no.

445
00:22:53.774 --> 00:22:56.510
I never dreamt you this clearly.

446
00:22:57.778 --> 00:22:59.714
You're exactly how I dreamt you.

447
00:22:59.814 --> 00:23:01.916
- [gasps]
- Oof. Hard luck. Larry.

448
00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:05.553
No. Luke had a mustache.

449
00:23:05.653 --> 00:23:07.288
Yeah. well. Joanie hated it.

450
00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:10.358
So I shave it off every morning
hoping she's gonna show up.

451
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:13.393
- Oh. my God.
- [squeals] How romantic.

452
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.131
And you did.

453
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.967
[Larry] Okay. sweetie.

454
00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:22.536
- Okay.
- Oh.

455
00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:24.138
- What you doing?
- Larry?

456
00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:25.573
- Okay. sweetie.
- I...

457
00:23:25.673 --> 00:23:26.774
- Let's go.
- [shudders] Oh.

458
00:23:26.874 --> 00:23:28.441
- Who's this guy?
- The second husband.

459
00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:31.245
- I prefer current husband.
- The current husband.

460
00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:34.148
- Oh.
- [Luke] Joanie. you're all right?

461
00:23:34.949 --> 00:23:35.917
[Joan] Oh. my God.

462
00:23:36.017 --> 00:23:38.485
- Honey. It was a lot for me too.
- [breathing deeply]

463
00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:42.455
Okay. I have to insist that I explain
exactly what's going on to my client.

464
00:23:42.556 --> 00:23:47.995
She clearly has a very
"difficult" decision to make.

465
00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:50.564
- [breathing shakily] Okay. Oh. that...
- Come on.

466
00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:53.834
- Oh. my God. he's really here.
- [Ryan giggles] And very attractive.

467
00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:55.770
[Joan] Is he taller?

468
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.105
So when you said you were waiting...

469
00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.275
I conjured her image
every day in my mind.

470
00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:06.914
Thought I did a good job. but
she's more stunning than I remember.

471
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.884
[stammers] Okay. That's a line. Luke.

472
00:24:10.718 --> 00:24:12.153
You were my bartender.

473
00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:15.488
Hmm?

474
00:24:15.589 --> 00:24:19.026
[Ryan] Nope. Nope. Nope.

475
00:24:20.528 --> 00:24:22.430
- Uh. mmm no.
- God. he looked so young.

476
00:24:23.064 --> 00:24:24.565
- [Ryan] This will have to do.
- [sighs]

477
00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:26.801
[sighs] Was he always that young?

478
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:28.536
That's a lot to take in.

479
00:24:28.636 --> 00:24:31.973
The love of your life waiting 67 years.

480
00:24:32.073 --> 00:24:33.341
And Larry.

481
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.076
Larry is my husband.

482
00:24:35.176 --> 00:24:37.044
- One of two.
- Yeah.

483
00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:37.979
Oh. that's pretty.

484
00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:39.613
You'll feel much better after you

485
00:24:39.714 --> 00:24:41.415
change out of that morbid ensemble.

486
00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:44.552
[breathing heavily] Ah. Oh. Oh.

487
00:24:44.652 --> 00:24:45.987
Yeah. that's pretty.

488
00:24:46.087 --> 00:24:48.322
That's... [whispers] Oh. he's so young.

489
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.192
Oh. he's so young.
[gasps] Oh. I don't...

490
00:24:51.292 --> 00:24:52.727
[Ryan] What's your ETA. doll?

491
00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:55.663
- [Joan breathing shakily] Oh.
- How's it looking?

492
00:24:57.565 --> 00:24:59.266
So... What...

493
00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:01.202
What am I supposed to do. huh?

494
00:25:01.569 --> 00:25:04.005
I need you to tell me...
[shudders] ...what to do.

495
00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:07.008
Oh. my dear. Okay. I read your file.

496
00:25:07.441 --> 00:25:10.077
And you are smart.
passionate and decisive.

497
00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.812
Oh. I am?

498
00:25:12.313 --> 00:25:15.816
I have complete faith that you
will choose the right eternity...

499
00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:19.020
- Yeah.
- ...and the right person to spend it with.

500
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.588
- Mmm.
- You'll do.

501
00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:22.990
- Do for what?
- [knocks on door]

502
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:25.493
Were you expecting someone. or...

503
00:25:25.593 --> 00:25:26.994
Were you?

504
00:25:27.995 --> 00:25:30.197
Uh... [gasps]

505
00:25:30.297 --> 00:25:33.901
Oh. my God. Luke. What
a surprise. [chuckles]

506
00:25:34.535 --> 00:25:35.970
What the hell. Reese?

507
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.873
It's Ryan. and it's been
Ryan for the last half hour.

508
00:25:38.973 --> 00:25:41.675
- [sighs] Yeah.
- You look amazing.

509
00:25:41.776 --> 00:25:43.744
Yeah. [exhales] I'm married.

510
00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:45.679
- To him.
- To Larry.

511
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.581
And Larry seems nice.

512
00:25:47.681 --> 00:25:51.919
Look. Joan. you must have thought.
or hoped. that this might happen?

513
00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:56.257
Well. I mean. yeah. Yeah. yeah.
You know. I-I have imagined it.

514
00:25:56.357 --> 00:25:57.825
- Great.
- [sighs]

515
00:25:58.392 --> 00:25:59.894
Hi.

516
00:25:59.994 --> 00:26:01.996
- I'll leave you kids to it. [chuckles]
- [breathing shakily] Oh.

517
00:26:02.096 --> 00:26:03.130
Hi.

518
00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:07.301
Did you even read my file?

519
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:09.837
You're more than words on a page to
me. buddy. You didn't even bring it up.

520
00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:11.872
Yeah. well. I had a lot
on my mind. I just died.

521
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:16.010
So. I'm sorry that I forgot to mention
that my wife's ex might be hanging around.

522
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.812
Technically. I don't think
we can call him her ex.

523
00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:19.413
First husband. maybe. but not an ex.

524
00:26:19.514 --> 00:26:21.516
[stutters] No. I'm not calling...
I'm never calling him that.

525
00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:24.752
Okay. I'm just trying to anticipate
what Ryan's gonna say. We have history.

526
00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:26.053
Great. What kind of history?

527
00:26:26.153 --> 00:26:28.889
- It was sexual.
- Of course it was. [scoffs]

528
00:26:28.989 --> 00:26:31.992
You know how many people wanted
this case? So many people.

529
00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:33.060
Really?

530
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.796
A man that's waited half
a century for his love? Ah!

531
00:26:35.896 --> 00:26:37.264
That's kinda sad if you think about it.

532
00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:39.433
You really think that's the way
that Joan's gonna think about it?

533
00:26:39.934 --> 00:26:41.735
- I don't know.
- It's okay.

534
00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:43.604
I'm sure they've had
one of these before.

535
00:26:43.704 --> 00:26:45.507
I mean. I don't know about
it. I've never had it.

536
00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:47.808
But I bet you there's a process.

537
00:26:47.908 --> 00:26:50.411
- He looks like Montgomery Clift.
- Oof!

538
00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:52.980
Oh. my gosh. I was saying
this just the other day.

539
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.983
Montgomery Clift. He is so handsome.

540
00:26:56.083 --> 00:26:58.520
- Luke is so handsome.
- You're not helping.

541
00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:01.455
I'm sorry. but it is what it is.

542
00:27:01.556 --> 00:27:02.923
Luke is hot.

543
00:27:03.023 --> 00:27:06.060
His eyes are bluer than the
ocean. He has a better narrative.

544
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.294
No. he doesn't.

545
00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.496
I have a better narrative.

546
00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:11.600
I was married to her for 65
years and I gave her children.

547
00:27:11.699 --> 00:27:14.301
Exactly. We go with that. That's strong.

548
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:16.571
There's nothing more powerful
than emotional blackmail.

549
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.805
- Right?
- Good on ya.

550
00:27:17.905 --> 00:27:19.373
[clicks tongue. sighs]

551
00:27:21.008 --> 00:27:24.011
So... [sighs] ...how have you been?

552
00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:26.881
Good. Yeah.

553
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:31.218
Well. I mean. I've been obviously
dead. but. you know. good.

554
00:27:32.554 --> 00:27:34.722
- Well. you look good.
- Yeah.

555
00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:36.591
I mean. you know. you
always... you always looked...

556
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.027
- [giggles] You always looked good.
- [sighs] Oh. yeah. Coming from you. huh?

557
00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:42.029
Oh. Oh. [giggles]

558
00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:47.201
Oh.

559
00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.038
Yeah. I. uh...

560
00:27:52.541 --> 00:27:53.908
[breathing heavily]

561
00:27:54.008 --> 00:27:57.512
Look. I-I don't know what
to say. It's... [sighs]

562
00:27:57.612 --> 00:27:59.914
Well. I had a long time to think
about what I was going to say.

563
00:28:00.014 --> 00:28:02.316
- Oh.
- I mean. I had a long. long time.

564
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:03.884
And?

565
00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:06.687
And I'm drawing a blank.

566
00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:08.289
Oh.

567
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:10.191
- [announcer] <i>Warning. Code seven four. </i>
- [chuckles]

568
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:11.825
- [security] Code seven four.
- Oh! Oh.

569
00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:13.360
- [security] Eyes on the bogey.
- [Joan] What the hell?

570
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.895
- Gary.
- [Joan whimpers]

571
00:28:14.995 --> 00:28:16.931
[Gary] Hey. Luke. You working tonight?

572
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:18.600
Not tonight. Tonight's a night off.

573
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:21.135
- Wait. Is this...
- [grunting]

574
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.637
- Mm-hmm.
- [grunts]

575
00:28:22.736 --> 00:28:25.839
Joan? No! [chuckles]

576
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.842
- No. [grunts] No. please.
- Move it!

577
00:28:28.943 --> 00:28:31.111
[escapee] I can't look at
another goddamn painting.

578
00:28:31.212 --> 00:28:32.614
- It's so boring.
- [Gary] All right.

579
00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:34.014
- Well. I better go.
- No! [grunting]

580
00:28:34.114 --> 00:28:36.083
- But. hey. you are one lucky lady.
- [Joan] Hmm?

581
00:28:36.183 --> 00:28:37.151
[security] Gary!

582
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:38.485
- Oh.
- Huh.

583
00:28:38.587 --> 00:28:40.321
- [Gary] Move it. I'm sick of this crap.
- [escapee] No. please!

584
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:41.690
[Gary] Get in here now!

585
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:42.856
[Luke] Oof.

586
00:28:42.957 --> 00:28:44.526
Museum World's the worst!

587
00:28:44.626 --> 00:28:46.260
- [Joan gasps] Oh. God.
- [sighs]

588
00:28:47.127 --> 00:28:50.231
Oh. my God. [breathes
shakily] What-What did he do?

589
00:28:50.331 --> 00:28:52.601
Oh. he tried to escape his eternity.

590
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.604
Once you've chosen.
you can't go back here.

591
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.471
You have to get it right.

592
00:28:58.105 --> 00:29:00.474
- Oh. that's a lot of pressure.
- [sighs] Yeah. it is.

593
00:29:00.575 --> 00:29:03.877
Look. I remembered what I
wanted to say to you first.

594
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.379
What?

595
00:29:06.581 --> 00:29:07.748
I love you.

596
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.218
Oh.

597
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.255
That's a... That's a good opener.

598
00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:15.557
[chuckles] Yeah.

599
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.527
Look. I know this is hard
for you. but I missed you.

600
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:22.963
I thought about you every single day.

601
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.534
There wasn't a day that went
by that I didn't think of you.

602
00:29:28.068 --> 00:29:31.205
Yeah. You know. I...

603
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.274
I wanted you to be happy.

604
00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:35.442
I wanted you to have a life.

605
00:29:36.844 --> 00:29:38.779
- Yeah?
- Yeah. of course.

606
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.415
But I waited.

607
00:29:41.516 --> 00:29:46.320
You know. I-I waited because I wanted
us to have a chance to have one too.

608
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.122
[breathing shakily] Oh.

609
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:50.491
I'm gonna be sick.

610
00:29:50.592 --> 00:29:52.459
- You okay?
- Oh. God. Why can you get sick here?

611
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.596
- Joan.
- [retching] Oh.

612
00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:56.297
- You all right?
- Uh. Luke? Luke. please.

613
00:29:56.397 --> 00:29:57.666
I need to think.

614
00:29:57.766 --> 00:30:00.000
[breathes shakily] Okay?

615
00:30:05.906 --> 00:30:07.441
[breathing heavily]

616
00:30:11.513 --> 00:30:12.479
Oh.

617
00:30:13.347 --> 00:30:14.315
Okay.

618
00:30:21.623 --> 00:30:23.190
- [knocks on door]
- [gasps]

619
00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:26.193
[whispers] Luke?

620
00:30:27.127 --> 00:30:28.095
Oh.

621
00:30:29.731 --> 00:30:31.832
Okay. [breathing heavily]

622
00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:39.507
- Hey. sweetie.
- Oh. Larry.

623
00:30:39.607 --> 00:30:42.644
So. I know this is a lot. but don't
worry. I've been doing the research.

624
00:30:42.744 --> 00:30:44.579
And here are some pretty good options.

625
00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:45.714
Sorry. options for?

626
00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:47.114
Yeah. for our eternity.

627
00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:48.949
What?

628
00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:51.919
Wow. You really look amazing.

629
00:30:52.019 --> 00:30:54.054
- The long hair suits you. I love it.
- [sighs] Oh.

630
00:30:54.154 --> 00:30:55.155
What?

631
00:30:55.255 --> 00:30:57.391
Oh. Everything works here.

632
00:30:57.925 --> 00:30:59.393
Oh. Larry.

633
00:30:59.493 --> 00:31:01.895
- What do you mean. "Larry"?
- Well. it's complicated.

634
00:31:01.995 --> 00:31:03.497
We were together a week ago.

635
00:31:03.598 --> 00:31:07.101
Yeah. well. a lot has happened in a
week. You died. Karen died. I died.

636
00:31:07.201 --> 00:31:10.437
[stutters] I just been reunited
with both of my dead husbands.

637
00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:13.407
And I learned that I have only a
week to pick where to spend eternity.

638
00:31:13.508 --> 00:31:16.343
Karen finally kicked it.
It's a big week for Oakdale.

639
00:31:16.443 --> 00:31:17.411
[groans] Oh.

640
00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:19.446
[sighs] Oh.

641
00:31:19.547 --> 00:31:20.782
Hey.

642
00:31:21.683 --> 00:31:24.218
- I know what'll make you feel better.
- [sighs] Oh. what?

643
00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:25.352
Squatting.

644
00:31:25.452 --> 00:31:26.788
Oh. Jesus Christ.

645
00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:28.255
[grunts] Just try it.

646
00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:30.792
- Fine. Okay.
- I'm telling you.

647
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:31.826
- Come on. Go.
- Okay. fine.

648
00:31:31.925 --> 00:31:33.093
[sighs]

649
00:31:33.193 --> 00:31:34.161
Go.

650
00:31:35.864 --> 00:31:36.964
Yeah. [chuckles]

651
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:39.133
- [whispers] Wow.
- I know. right?

652
00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:42.002
- I got so low there. [gasps]
- You did get so low there.

653
00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:44.371
- Yeah. I know. It feels so good.
- [gasps]

654
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:45.807
[both grunt]

655
00:31:45.906 --> 00:31:47.141
I've been doing a bunch of stuff.

656
00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:49.143
- [Joan] Oh. Looking good.
- [Larry] Yeah.

657
00:31:49.243 --> 00:31:51.713
- You look good. [pants]
- I know. Thanks. Thanks.

658
00:31:51.813 --> 00:31:53.815
- Work it out.
- I miss these hips.

659
00:31:53.914 --> 00:31:55.750
- Whoo!
- Oh. God.

660
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.951
Yeah. look at this. Look at this.

661
00:31:59.754 --> 00:32:04.425
Oh. You were right. That. uh.
that did make me feel better.

662
00:32:04.526 --> 00:32:05.593
I knew it would.

663
00:32:05.693 --> 00:32:07.695
- Oh.
- [both panting]

664
00:32:07.796 --> 00:32:09.363
[Joan inhales sharply. sighs]

665
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:12.132
- [coughs]
- Are you kidding me?

666
00:32:12.232 --> 00:32:13.902
- Larry!
- It's too much salt.

667
00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:15.135
[coughing]

668
00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:16.671
I need... I need time.

669

- It was my idea.
- It was my idea.

840
00:39:35.076 --> 00:39:38.779
[Anna. distorted] I took his idea and
I made it better. I'm making a plan.

841
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.248
[Ryan. distorted] Oh.
it's about control?

842
00:39:40.348 --> 00:39:41.816
[Anna] Yep. Yep.

843
00:39:52.793 --> 00:39:53.728
[door opens]

844
00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:55.930
Oh.

845
00:40:06.507 --> 00:40:08.276
- So?
- Good news.

846
00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:10.878
- I talked to Frank. and basically--
- Actually. I talked to Frank.

847
00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:12.780
The point is. somebody talked to Frank.

848
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.449
They then talked to Tom. and then
they talked to a guy way up top.

849
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.319
- The big guy.
- Kevin.

850
00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:20.321
And you got approved for a plan.

851
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.589
Anna. just say the plan.

852
00:40:21.689 --> 00:40:23.391
- Okay. sorry. So typic--
- So. typically here--

853
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.792
Anna. You're Anna?

854
00:40:25.326 --> 00:40:26.761
- No.
- Okay.

855
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:28.162
So typically when you get here.

856
00:40:28.262 --> 00:40:30.497
you get to pick eternity. and
that's it. Bing. bang. boom.

857
00:40:30.598 --> 00:40:35.569
However. in this unique circumstance.
you've gotten approved for a special visa.

858
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.872
Joan will be allowed two
visits to an eternity.

859
00:40:37.972 --> 00:40:39.941
- One with each of her former husbands.
-  Mm-hmm.

860
00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:42.510
- And then?
- And then she'll decide.

861
00:40:43.544 --> 00:40:44.679
Between the two of you.

862
00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:46.847
It seems like kind of a
high-pressure scenario.

863
00:40:46.948 --> 00:40:49.250
Okay. Well. you could all
choose the same eternity

864
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.483
and then work it out from there.

865
00:40:50.584 --> 00:40:52.520
But then you'd be in the
same place together forever.

866
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.821
Oh. that could work.

867
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:55.122
- No. no.
- I'm done... [stutters]

868
00:40:55.222 --> 00:40:56.857
I'm done with this guy
creeping in the shadows.

869
00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:58.592
- Creeping in the shadows?
- Lurking.

870
00:40:58.693 --> 00:41:00.394
- Lurking?
- Yeah. You're a lurker. pal.

871
00:41:00.493 --> 00:41:03.164
And you're waiting beyond to
spoil a half a century of marriage.

872
00:41:03.264 --> 00:41:04.999
Well. I'm sorry I died
defending our country.

873
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:07.335
- It was Korea. buddy. Relax.
- What'd you say to me?

874
00:41:07.435 --> 00:41:09.804
You didn't exactly storm the
beaches of Normandy. did you?

875
00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:13.274
- What... What are you doing?
- You went there.

876
00:41:13.374 --> 00:41:14.709
Hey. Hey! Stop!

877
00:41:14.809 --> 00:41:15.876
- Hit him back. Larry.
- Stop!

878
00:41:15.977 --> 00:41:17.645
- [Luke] I will bare-knuckle you.
-  Yes. Luke!

879
00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:19.013
[Joan] Stop it! Okay?

880
00:41:19.113 --> 00:41:20.848
This is what we're doing!

881
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:23.718
So. just...

882
00:41:25.586 --> 00:41:27.888
flip a coin and decide
who's going first.

883
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:29.023
No.

884
00:41:29.123 --> 00:41:31.993
I will not stand for
another man dating my wife.

885
00:41:32.093 --> 00:41:32.994
[scoffs]

886
00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:34.195
Maybe you should've
thought about that before

887
00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:35.730
you married another man's wife.

888
00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.797
Boys!

889
00:41:37.732 --> 00:41:39.066
Who's going first?

890
00:41:41.535 --> 00:41:43.070
- I have a coin.
- [sighs]

891
00:41:46.107 --> 00:41:47.608
[Larry mutters]

892
00:41:48.976 --> 00:41:50.044
[sighs]

893
00:41:50.144 --> 00:41:51.312
Oh. shit.

894
00:41:51.412 --> 00:41:53.714
- Is that a pretzel?
- No.

895
00:41:53.814 --> 00:41:55.383
- Oh. my God.
- You still eating pretzels.

896
00:41:55.483 --> 00:41:57.218
- Yeah. [grunts] Relax.
- Get on with it.

897
00:41:58.352 --> 00:41:59.286
Heads or tails?

898
00:41:59.987 --> 00:42:01.155
Heads.

899
00:42:01.922 --> 00:42:05.292
[announcer] <i>The next stop</i>
<i>is Mountain World 312.</i>

900
00:42:05.393 --> 00:42:06.560
Oh. [chuckles]

901
00:42:10.698 --> 00:42:12.066
- What?
- I just...

902
00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:15.369
forgot how handsome you are.

903
00:42:15.736 --> 00:42:18.072
We were an attractive couple.

904
00:42:18.172 --> 00:42:20.509
Oh. come on. Everybody...

905
00:42:20.941 --> 00:42:24.678
Everybody assumed that you got
me pregnant and had to marry me.

906
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:27.148
Yeah. no. My mother. she
was... she was so upset

907
00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:29.817
when I told her that I wasn't.
because she... [inhales]

908
00:42:29.917 --> 00:42:32.753
Well. she wanted hot grandkids so badly.

909
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.188
Not that my kids are ugly.

910
00:42:34.288 --> 00:42:35.956
I'm sure that they are hot.

911
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:38.893
Not that I care.

912
00:42:38.993 --> 00:42:39.860
I didn't assume.

913
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.396
Yeah. 'Cause I'm not...
I'm not into hot kids.

914
00:42:42.496 --> 00:42:44.331
No. I'm not into hot kids either.

915
00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:47.701
Yeah.

916
00:42:50.704 --> 00:42:52.073
I'm not into kids.

917
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.308
Good.

918
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:56.043
That's good.

919
00:42:56.545 --> 00:42:57.845
[both chuckle]

920
00:43:09.723 --> 00:43:12.359
[Luke gasping]

921
00:43:17.064 --> 00:43:19.200
I remember the sky being bluer.

922
00:43:20.101 --> 00:43:21.068
Oh.

923
00:43:21.735 --> 00:43:23.104
Was it always that shade?

924
00:43:23.505 --> 00:43:24.738
Oh. yeah. Pretty much.

925
00:43:26.474 --> 00:43:27.908
Is that cloud moving?

926
00:43:28.008 --> 00:43:28.976
[stammers]

927
00:43:30.244 --> 00:43:31.212
Yep.

928
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.248
They move.

929
00:43:35.783 --> 00:43:37.251
- [laughs]
- [trills lips]

930
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:41.956
[exhales sharply]

931
00:43:44.526 --> 00:43:46.060
Is it how you imagined it?

932
00:43:46.627 --> 00:43:47.862
It's perfect.

933
00:43:53.234 --> 00:43:54.969
[Joan] Oh. boy. Oh. Okay.

934
00:43:56.036 --> 00:43:57.271
Okay.

935
00:43:57.371 --> 00:43:58.672
- [screams]
- [laughs]

936
00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:01.275
Can't die twice.

937
00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:03.110
You can't die twice.

938
00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.178
[sighs] Okay.

939
00:44:04.278 --> 00:44:06.280
- [shouts]
- [laughs]

940
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:13.687
This okay?

941
00:44:15.422 --> 00:44:16.525
Mm-hmm.

942
00:44:16.891 --> 00:44:18.159
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

943
00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:23.097
No. we didn't know where
to put any of the trash.

944
00:44:23.197 --> 00:44:26.601
And so we didn't know they had a
place where bears didn't get to.

945
00:44:27.034 --> 00:44:29.303
It's cold. Was it always this cold?

946
00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:32.907
[laughing] It's cold.

947
00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:37.311
Let's get you somewhere
nice and warm. huh?

948
00:44:38.045 --> 00:44:39.514
Mmm.

949
00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:41.916
I don't like how Luke's been going
around telling people he died in the war.

950
00:44:42.016 --> 00:44:43.717
Larry. the man died in the war.

951
00:44:43.817 --> 00:44:47.589
No. I know. but it's the way he says it.
"The war." like it's one of the cool ones.

952
00:44:47.688 --> 00:44:51.091
Okay. I think we should stop
squabbling about his obvious heroism.

953
00:44:51.192 --> 00:44:53.494
because I don't think that's
our strongest point of attack.

954
00:44:53.595 --> 00:44:54.828
[breathing heavily]

955
00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:57.932
The problem is Luke's
always been a memory.

956
00:44:58.032 --> 00:45:00.201
Now. I don't know how
you compete with a memory.

957
00:45:00.734 --> 00:45:03.237
All we are. are a
collection of memories.

958
00:45:03.337 --> 00:45:05.339
That's depressing. I don't like that.

959
00:45:05.439 --> 00:45:07.808
But the point is. you're
going to have to remind her

960
00:45:07.908 --> 00:45:10.010
of why she fell in love
with you in the first place.

961
00:45:11.412 --> 00:45:12.379
Honestly...

962
00:45:14.081 --> 00:45:16.450
I don't know why she
fell in love with me.

963
00:45:16.551 --> 00:45:17.751
Mmm.

964
00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:22.089
Well. you're gonna have to
figure that out. And fast.

965
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:28.663
There's someone here I gotta find.

966
00:45:28.762 --> 00:45:31.832
Okay. Now we're cooking.
Now we're cooking.

967
00:45:34.868 --> 00:45:37.404
My great-granddaughter
Charlotte would love this place.

968
00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:39.340
She's a little adventurer.

969
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.076
I guess so was her
mother. for that matter.

970
00:45:44.646 --> 00:45:46.514
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

971
00:45:48.015 --> 00:45:49.984
I'm sure she misses you.

972
00:45:50.719 --> 00:45:52.920
So is that okay? You
know. talking about...

973
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.190
- Mm-hmm. [sips] Yeah.
-  Okay.

974
00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.092
- You're not angry with me?
- For what?

975
00:45:58.192 --> 00:46:00.794
It's just... Sixty-seven
years. you know?

976
00:46:00.894 --> 00:46:05.833
I remarried after two years.
and you waited 67 years.

977
00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:07.868
Sixty-seven years. Wow.

978
00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:11.438
- [laughs]
- Mmm.

979
00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:15.175
Yeah.

980
00:46:19.514 --> 00:46:20.781
[breathes deeply]

981
00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:28.222
When eternity's on the line. one
lifetime of waiting seems like nothing.

982
00:46:30.057 --> 00:46:32.126
Jesus. you are so perfect.

983
00:46:32.226 --> 00:46:33.093
I'm not perfect.

984
00:46:33.193 --> 00:46:35.162
Oh. that's what perfect
people say. [laughs]

985
00:46:35.262 --> 00:46:37.197
Fine. I hate hearing about your kids

986
00:46:37.298 --> 00:46:39.166
and your grandkids and
the kids they had. okay?

987
00:46:39.266 --> 00:46:41.468
I mean. I don't-I don't hate them.

988
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:42.537
Okay.

989
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:47.575
But it kills me that I didn't
get to have all that with you.

990
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.278
[sighs]

991
00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:54.081
I'm glad you had it.

992
00:46:56.618 --> 00:46:58.319
I'm glad you had a happy life.

993
00:47:02.022 --> 00:47:03.290
[inhales sharply]

994
00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:08.095
I would go to the docks
waiting for you to return.

995
00:47:08.495 --> 00:47:11.098
Watching all the soldiers
stream onto shore.

996
00:47:11.198 --> 00:47:13.200
'cause I convinced myself
that they got it wrong.

997
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.302
- That you would be among them. And...
- Joan.

998
00:47:18.172 --> 00:47:23.110
I would just sit and watch and wait.

999
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:28.449
So I...

1000
00:47:30.951 --> 00:47:32.853
I did wait for you. Luke.

1001
00:47:36.223 --> 00:47:37.257
Yeah.

1002
00:47:37.358 --> 00:47:38.325
Yeah.

1003
00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:44.532
Hmm.

1004
00:47:44.632 --> 00:47:45.600
Hey.

1005
00:47:47.736 --> 00:47:48.902
Come with me.

1006
00:48:00.715 --> 00:48:02.116
[crying]

1007
00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:10.257
If I wasn't already dead. I'd be
worried you're about to kill me.

1008
00:48:13.862 --> 00:48:16.531
- Do you trust me?
- Oh. [chuckling] Sure.

1009
00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:18.566
Come on.

1010
00:48:22.804 --> 00:48:25.406
Hello. Mr. Fenwick.

1011
00:48:25.507 --> 00:48:26.674
Just Fenwick.

1012
00:48:28.108 --> 00:48:30.411
Right. Uh. we haven't
been here before--

1013
00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:32.413
Individual or shared?

1014
00:48:34.415 --> 00:48:36.785
- Shared.
- Do not touch the exhibits.

1015
00:48:36.885 --> 00:48:38.553
Remember. the exhibits aren't real.

1016
00:48:38.653 --> 00:48:41.922
We take no responsibility
for emotional trauma.

1017
00:48:42.022 --> 00:48:43.157
Happy reliving.

1018
00:48:44.458 --> 00:48:45.426
You ready?

1019
00:48:45.527 --> 00:48:46.493
For what?

1020
00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:48.596
[chuckles]

1021
00:49:00.107 --> 00:49:01.709
[Luke] Every eternity has one.

1022
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.678
We call it archive tunnels.

1023
00:49:03.778 --> 00:49:05.245
[Joan] Which means?

1024
00:49:05.345 --> 00:49:08.048
[Luke] I don't know. I've never
been to an eternity before.

1025
00:49:11.118 --> 00:49:12.620
We can find out together.

1026
00:49:21.995 --> 00:49:23.063
[gasps]

1027
00:49:23.163 --> 00:49:24.998
- [Luke] Hi. What's your name?
- Oh.

1028
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.702
- Yeah. you.
-  Oh. I-I'm Joan.

1029
00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:29.804
Yeah.

1030
00:49:29.904 --> 00:49:31.238
[laughs] What's your name?

1031
00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:33.708
- Luke.
- Nice to meet you. Luke.

1032
00:49:34.943 --> 00:49:36.477
- Oh. Luke.
- [Luke] Joan's a pretty name.

1033
00:49:36.578 --> 00:49:37.846
I haven't seen you around here before.

1034
00:49:37.946 --> 00:49:40.915
[Joan] Oh... [stammering]
...well. I just moved to the city.

1035
00:49:41.014 --> 00:49:42.884
Just around the corner. Briar...

1036
00:49:42.983 --> 00:49:43.918
[Luke] Briar cliff?

1037
00:49:44.017 --> 00:49:45.185
Come on.

1038
00:49:51.258 --> 00:49:53.862
[chatting indistinctly]

1039
00:49:54.629 --> 00:49:57.297
- [Luke] I was so nervous. Look at me.
-  That's not what I'm saying--

1040
00:49:57.832 --> 00:49:59.366
Look at you.

1041
00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:01.636
Oh. [laughing]

1042
00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:10.512
[Luke] Joan. I love you so much.

1043
00:50:10.612 --> 00:50:12.346
[Joan chuckles. gasps]

1044
00:50:22.022 --> 00:50:23.156
[Luke] Come on.

1045
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.294
[breathing heavily]

1046
00:50:29.196 --> 00:50:30.965
Oh. nope. No. no.

1047
00:50:31.064 --> 00:50:32.299
No. Luke. come on.

1048
00:50:32.399 --> 00:50:35.537
- Oh. we're really going for it. eh?
- Hey.

1049
00:50:35.637 --> 00:50:38.405
Stop! [laughing]

1050
00:50:53.453 --> 00:50:54.556
[Luke sighs]

1051
00:50:57.124 --> 00:50:58.660
I don't wanna see this one.

1052
00:51:03.631 --> 00:51:04.666
I love you.

1053
00:51:04.766 --> 00:51:05.767
I love you.

1054
00:51:15.475 --> 00:51:17.745
[sighs] Worst day of my life.

1055
00:51:18.947 --> 00:51:21.816
[breathes shakily. cries]

1056
00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:30.625
Luke. [breathes shakily]

1057
00:51:30.725 --> 00:51:32.660
I missed you so much.

1058
00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:35.495
Yeah.

1059
00:51:52.714 --> 00:51:53.681
[kisses]

1060
00:51:54.682 --> 00:51:56.618
[breathes deeply]

1061
00:52:01.956 --> 00:52:03.323
We should go.

1062
00:52:04.224 --> 00:52:05.593
Luke. please.

1063
00:52:05.693 --> 00:52:07.327
I don't remember this.

1064
00:52:07.427 --> 00:52:10.798
- You don't need to see this.
- What's he doing at our dock?

1065
00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:12.700
Can we just go please?

1066
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.134
[gasps] Please...

1067
00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:15.837
Oh. God. Luke. Please.

1068
00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:17.705
[laughs]

1069
00:52:20.407 --> 00:52:22.175
[Larry] Will you marry me?

1070
00:52:22.275 --> 00:52:24.879
- [Joan laughs] Of course.
- [Larry chuckles]

1071
00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:28.016
He made her death about him.
It's selfish. is what it is.

1072
00:52:28.116 --> 00:52:32.152
- If you say so. So who's Karen?
- Oh. God. She's a neighbor.

1073
00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.389
Longest-serving member
of the Oakdale Avenue HOA.

1074
00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:37.659
and she won't let you forget it.

1075
00:52:38.126 --> 00:52:40.160
She would always leave these
little sticky notes on my door.

1076
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.064
- She was a very passive-aggressive woman.
-  Okay. Here we are. Here we are.

1077
00:52:43.163 --> 00:52:44.799
- Gimme some space.
- Sorry.

1078
00:52:49.269 --> 00:52:52.774
[gasps] Larry. I heard
about the pretzels.

1079
00:52:52.874 --> 00:52:54.142
Karen. You're still old.

1080
00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:56.844
I'm 72 now. thank you very much.

1081
00:52:57.612 --> 00:52:58.513
Yeah. no.

1082
00:52:58.613 --> 00:53:01.616
Sorry. it's just a weird
age to be your happiest.

1083
00:53:01.716 --> 00:53:04.284
- You remember when Jim died?
- That was your happiest?

1084
00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:06.353
- When your husband died?
- Oh. Jim was a dear.

1085
00:53:06.453 --> 00:53:10.357
But anyway. that summer when I went on
that pottery retreat with my friend Barb...

1086
00:53:11.092 --> 00:53:12.225
Right.

1087
00:53:12.325 --> 00:53:13.528
Well. Barb and I were lovers.

1088
00:53:13.628 --> 00:53:15.663
- [gasps]
- Oh. I-I didn't--

1089
00:53:15.763 --> 00:53:19.767
I went full lesbian for three
months. and it was fabulous.

1090
00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:24.072
But then I came back and I
had the kids. and the grandkids

1091
00:53:24.172 --> 00:53:28.509
and the church group. and I just went
back into that miserable old closet.

1092
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:30.377
Oh. that explains why
you were so mean to me.

1093
00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:32.046
Oh. no. I just didn't like you.

1094
00:53:32.146 --> 00:53:33.246
Right.

1095
00:53:33.346 --> 00:53:35.282
I came around eventually.

1096
00:53:35.382 --> 00:53:38.786
- You grow on people. Larry.
-  Mm-hmm.

1097
00:53:38.886 --> 00:53:39.921
I'm thinking...

1098
00:53:41.923 --> 00:53:43.323
Paris Land.

1099
00:53:43.423 --> 00:53:47.061
It's basically Paris in the '60s.
but they speak English with an accent.

1100
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.896
And they have civil rights.

1101
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:50.898
I take it you're waiting on Joan.

1102
00:53:50.998 --> 00:53:52.432
No. she's already here.

1103
00:53:52.533 --> 00:53:54.902
Ooh. shit week for Oakdale.

1104
00:53:55.435 --> 00:53:58.072
- So where you guys going?
- It's complicated.

1105
00:53:58.172 --> 00:54:00.074
- Oh. are you gay too?
- Mmm.

1106
00:54:00.174 --> 00:54:03.310
- Honestly. that would be easier.
- [Karen sighs] Look at you.

1107
00:54:04.912 --> 00:54:07.447
You seem so uncomfortable.

1108
00:54:07.548 --> 00:54:09.083
- [Anna] Mm-hmm.
-  Nah.

1109
00:54:09.183 --> 00:54:10.383
- I-I'm hot.
-  [Karen] Think about it.

1110
00:54:10.484 --> 00:54:12.452
The worst thing in the world
has already happened to you.

1111
00:54:12.553 --> 00:54:14.287
[chuckles] He wishes.

1112
00:54:14.387 --> 00:54:16.891
- Do tell.
- So. girl. this is what happened.

1113
00:54:16.991 --> 00:54:19.227
Okay. L-Listen. I came
here to ask a question.

1114
00:54:19.326 --> 00:54:20.862
and goddamn it. I'm gonna
ask Karen a question.

1115
00:54:20.962 --> 00:54:22.496
Then ask the question.

1116
00:54:23.164 --> 00:54:27.769
Karen. did Joan ever mention. um...

1117
00:54:28.836 --> 00:54:30.671
Why do you think she
fell in love with me?

1118
00:54:34.909 --> 00:54:37.211
- [Karen] Uh...
- Karen. say something.

1119
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:40.480
- Anything. Just say something.
- Well. I...

1120
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:43.184
- Um... [sighs]
- Anything.

1121
00:54:43.283 --> 00:54:45.887
[inhales deeply] I
don't know. She just did.

1122
00:54:45.987 --> 00:54:48.222
- [Larry sighs]
- I mean. I-I never thought

1123
00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:50.658
she'd be happy again after Luke died...

1124
00:54:50.758 --> 00:54:52.459
- [groans]
- ...but you made her happy.

1125
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.528
Mmm.

1126
00:54:53.628 --> 00:54:56.264
You made your life
about making her happy.

1127
00:54:56.363 --> 00:54:59.033
- Isn't that enough?
- [Larry] Eh.

1128
00:54:59.133 --> 00:55:00.500
Luke is here.

1129
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:02.369
- Joan's Luke?
-  Mm-hmm.

1130
00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:05.673
- Oh. he was so dreamy.
- [groans]

1131
00:55:05.773 --> 00:55:07.775
I used to pretend I fancied him.

1132
00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:10.443
- Of course. I didn't.
- Because you're a big. secret lesbian?

1133
00:55:10.545 --> 00:55:11.779
- Exactly.
- Mmm.

1134
00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:12.847
But. wow.

1135
00:55:13.781 --> 00:55:14.749
He was perfect.

1136
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:16.449
Hey. listen to me.

1137
00:55:16.551 --> 00:55:17.819
No one is perfect.

1138
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:19.687
No one is perfect!

1139
00:55:19.787 --> 00:55:22.489
- [Karen] Larry. don't be like that!
- No one is perfect!

1140
00:55:22.924 --> 00:55:25.927
- [Joan] Luke. Luke. would you calm down?
- [Luke] About what?

1141
00:55:26.426 --> 00:55:28.663
[grunts] You know. if you just...

1142
00:55:28.763 --> 00:55:31.999
If you think about it.
it was his way of saying

1143
00:55:32.099 --> 00:55:34.302
that-that he knew that you
would always be a part of me.

1144
00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:36.671
Come on. Joan. He wormed his way in.

1145
00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:38.706
He manipulated you by using your grief.

1146
00:55:38.806 --> 00:55:40.007
- No.
- He is such a leech.

1147
00:55:40.107 --> 00:55:41.943
That is not what happened. okay?

1148
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:43.711
You left.

1149
00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.014
I didn't leave. I died.

1150
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.017
[breathes heavily]

1151
00:55:53.588 --> 00:55:56.090
Would you have said yes if
you weren't still grieving?

1152
00:55:57.058 --> 00:55:59.126
I never stopped grieving.

1153
00:56:01.863 --> 00:56:03.130
Would you say yes?

1154
00:56:07.935 --> 00:56:09.070
[scoffs]

1155
00:56:17.377 --> 00:56:19.013
[Anna] Larry. Larry! Listen.

1156
00:56:19.113 --> 00:56:21.682
I am rooting for you. but
this is not the way. okay?

1157
00:56:21.782 --> 00:56:24.051
It's not even about him.
This is about you and Joan.

1158
00:56:24.151 --> 00:56:27.154
The woman who you have
loved for 65 beautiful years.

1159
00:56:27.255 --> 00:56:28.990
and have made her very happy.

1160
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.792
This is about showing that
same woman that you're willing

1161
00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:34.929
to spend all of eternity
together to do the same thing.

1162
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:37.698
- Now. is this gonna make her happy?
- [grunts]

1163
00:56:39.533 --> 00:56:40.635
- Okay. cool.
- What kind of creep

1164
00:56:40.735 --> 00:56:41.636
leaves their door unlocked?

1165
00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:43.371
- Maybe he doesn't
have anything to hide.

1166
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.139
- Nah. everybody's
got something to hide.

1167
00:56:45.239 --> 00:56:46.707
[Anna sighs]

1168
00:56:47.174 --> 00:56:48.542
That's a little dramatic.

1169
00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:51.078
It's actually really hard to keep
track of time here. so I applaud him.

1170
00:56:51.178 --> 00:56:53.014
It's very practical.

1171
00:56:53.114 --> 00:56:54.916
Larry. come on.

1172
00:56:56.517 --> 00:56:58.586
Ha! Does a perfect person look at this?

1173
00:56:58.686 --> 00:57:00.621
You've never looked
at porn before. Larry?

1174
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:05.425
- [Anna] Mm-hmm.
-  Ah. What about this?

1175
00:57:05.526 --> 00:57:06.961
Look at all these numbers.

1176
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:09.297
- Yeah. it's numbers.
- That one's got lipstick.

1177
00:57:09.397 --> 00:57:10.765
- Mm-hmm.
-  That means they're kissing.

1178
00:57:10.865 --> 00:57:14.101
Yeah. it's been 67
years. What would you do?

1179
00:57:16.037 --> 00:57:19.307
Larry. come on. This is
enough. It's too much.

1180
00:57:19.407 --> 00:57:21.509
Yeah. What am I doing?
Let's go. [sniffs]

1181
00:57:21.609 --> 00:57:23.110
- Let's just go.
- What the...

1182
00:57:23.978 --> 00:57:25.445
You goddamn snake.

1183
00:57:25.546 --> 00:57:27.415
Well. clearly the date
didn't go too well. did it?

1184
00:57:27.515 --> 00:57:28.683
Oh. you took advantage of her.

1185
00:57:28.783 --> 00:57:30.217
What're you talking about?

1186
00:57:30.318 --> 00:57:32.820
You made your engagement about me.

1187
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.989
You used my death to worm your way in.

1188
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:37.425
- I don't have to listen to this.
- I felt awful leaving Joan alone.

1189
00:57:37.558 --> 00:57:39.226
I genuinely hoped she
would find someone.

1190
00:57:39.327 --> 00:57:40.628
Yeah. right.

1191
00:57:40.728 --> 00:57:43.064
But she woulda been better
off alone than with you.

1192
00:57:43.496 --> 00:57:45.166
- [grunting. panting]
- Well. I tried.

1193
00:57:48.235 --> 00:57:49.837
Hey. is that hair dye? [laughs]

[Luke groans]

1195
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:54.008
[Larry] Stop!

1196
00:57:55.475 --> 00:57:56.644
My nose!

1197
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.581
Get off of me!

1198
00:58:00.681 --> 00:58:01.782
- Get off me!
- Get off me.

1199
00:58:01.882 --> 00:58:04.618
That's it? That's all y'all can do?

1200
00:58:07.722 --> 00:58:09.390
I didn't betray you. Luke.

1201
00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:11.292
[pants] I didn't even know you.

1202
00:58:11.392 --> 00:58:16.664
Yeah. Then why did you
propose at the dock? [sniffs]

1203
00:58:20.034 --> 00:58:21.168

1216
00:58:56.470 --> 00:59:00.708
Quite a few of them weren't

Luke is best for me?

1227

I want you to choose Luke
because it's the life you missed.

1228
00:59:40.781 --> 00:59:43.117
Eternity is a long time to have regrets.

1229
00:59:44.652 --> 00:59:47.488
But that's your decision to make.

Well. you need to figure it out.

1233
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:57.932
Sorry.

1234
01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:08.209
Just have fun at the beach tomorrow.

1238
01:00:21.188 --> 01:00:23.958
- Yeah. it's fine.
- Very popular. It's okay.

1239
01:00:24.058 --> 01:00:25.626
Wonder if we can get an umbrella.

1240
01:00:25.726 --> 01:00:29.029
[Joan] Yeah. you'd think that they
would hand one to you. huh? Or a chair?

1241
01:00:34.536 --> 01:00:36.103

Oh. [chuckles]

1245
01:00:46.313 --> 01:00:48.550
I mean. you are beautiful.

1246
01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:51.352
And you've always been beautiful.

1247
01:00:51.452 --> 01:00:54.321
- you never stopped being beautiful.
- I get what you mean. love.

[Larry breathes deeply]

1249
01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:59.660
You are right though. This
would've been a nice vacation.

1250
01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:02.796
I mean. it doesn't have to be here.

1252
01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:07.602
We can go to space for all I care.

[Joan] Okay. Larry. it's a child.

01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:28.657
Oh. he's-he's probably 90.

1260
01:01:28.756 --> 01:01:30.224
I actually died when I was nine.

1261
01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:32.527
- Oh.
- Oh.

1262
01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:34.328
- Right. [clears throat]
- Hit and run.

1263
01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:36.463

1264
01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:37.831
It was not quick.

1265
01:01:38.299 --> 01:01:42.169
It was very. very slow.

don't we just get out of here.

1268
01:01:47.107 --> 01:01:48.108
Okay.

1269
01:01:53.881 --> 01:01:55.517
[Larry] How was my funeral?

1270
01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:56.884
Decent turnout?

1271
01:01:56.984 --> 01:01:59.286
Yeah. you would've liked it.

1272
01:01:59.386 --> 01:02:00.622
Really?

1273
01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:02.957
Well. I mean. you would've pretended
to hate it. but it was nice.

- [chuckles]

1276
01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:09.564
Did he try to be funny?

1277
01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:13.467
Yeah. he did. He did try to be
funny. But. you know. it was sweet.

1278
01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:16.403
The kids were-were so devastated.

1279
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:19.440
Who was the most devastated?

1280
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:24.178
- [chuckling] I'm not answering that.
- [chuckling]

1281
01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:29.783
Sweetie. I'm sorry I
wasn't there when you...

1282
01:02:31.285 --> 01:02:32.486
You know.

1283
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.023
Yeah. but you were waiting
for me when I arrived.

Mmm?

1289
01:02:56.143 --> 01:03:00.014
You have to understand that
I'm in an impossible situation.

1290
01:03:02.684 --> 01:03:05.219
No. I don't understand.

1291
01:03:06.153 --> 01:03:07.955
I understand you loved Luke.

1292
01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.990
I loved Sally Daniels
in the ninth grade.

1293
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:12.560
He wasn't some childhood
crush. Larry. He was my husband.

1294
01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:15.630
Yeah. but we built a life together. and
now you just wanna throw it all away.

1295
01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:18.999
Well. I never had a chance to
start a life with Luke. and...

1296
01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.935
- you know. God. he waited 67--
- Sixty-seven years.

1297
01:03:22.036 --> 01:03:23.937
Yeah. I get it. I would've
done the same thing.

1298
01:03:24.038 --> 01:03:26.040
Well. you knew I was close.

1299
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.842
I was ready to wait
for as long as it took.

1300
01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:32.413
- [sighs]
- I was.

1301
01:03:32.514 --> 01:03:35.517
It's getting late. We should
head back. okay. honey?

Okay. hold on.

1305
01:03:43.758 --> 01:03:45.225
I'm holding on.

The flat.

1331
01:04:58.566 --> 01:05:01.135
When we pulled over. do
you remember what you said?

1332
01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:04.873
You said that. "This is the
perfect place for a flat tire.

1333

day. quiet road."

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:19.346
Okay.

1349
01:06:19.446 --> 01:06:21.749
- So. uh. what-what's what's going on?
-  What is...

1350
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.050
Yeah. what're
you guys--

1351
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:24.652
I think it's important you
hear what Luke has to say.

1352
01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:25.954
I'm so sorry. Larry.

1353
01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:28.556
You should be. 'cause after
Larry broke into my apartment. I--

1354
01:06:28.656 --> 01:06:30.991
- [stammers] After he what?
- [stammers] No. the door was open.

1355
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:32.292
- Was it?
- Jesus. Larry.

1356
01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:34.562
- Not a big deal.
- What is your... Sorry. what is that?

1357
01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:36.698
- [Luke] Do the honors.
- Okay. Look. that I can ex...

1358
01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:39.066
- I can explain. It's okay.
- It sounds way worse than it is.

1359
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.802
- "Dear Jo. I..." No.
- No. Give it to me.

1360
01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:42.002
We don't need to do this right now.

1361
01:06:42.102 --> 01:06:43.738
- Honey... Just give me...
- Joanie. I just wanted you to know

1362
01:06:43.838 --> 01:06:45.940
- the truth about this man.
- Hey. I can... Let me talk--

1363
01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:47.775
- [Larry groans]
- [Luke] Oh. go grovel.

1364
01:06:47.876 --> 01:06:51.846
Just... Okay. I know. but
it-it-it's out of context. honey.

1365
01:06:51.946 --> 01:06:53.013
Yes. it is.

1366
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.782
I'm sorry. you said that...

1367
01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:57.585
that you were willing to
wait as long as it took.

1368
01:06:57.685 --> 01:06:59.621
but you-you couldn't
even last a measly week?

1369
01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:00.922
I was. I honest... I...

1370
01:07:01.021 --> 01:07:02.724
Um. I was trying to set
up our eternity. and--

1371
01:07:02.824 --> 01:07:04.358
And you just assumed that
I would come find you?

1372
01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:06.059
Well. yeah. because you're my wife.

1373
01:07:06.159 --> 01:07:10.030
I'm sorry. you were... you were really
willing to trick me into an eternity?

1374
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.332
No. swe... I wasn't trying to
trick you. okay? I honestly...

1375
01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:14.268
I swear to God. I thought
I was doing the right thing.

1376
01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:17.672
God. And to think I was
killing myself over this.

1377
01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:19.172
And you-you...

1378
01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:23.978
God. you-you are so selfish!

1379
01:07:24.077 --> 01:07:25.178
- I'm being selfish?
- Yeah.

1380
01:07:25.279 --> 01:07:27.180
You are being selfish.
because you're here

1381
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:29.349
trying to decide between
a man buffet of...

1382
01:07:29.884 --> 01:07:30.919
men.

1383
01:07:31.019 --> 01:07:32.286
[stammering] And I guarantee

1384
01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:34.121
you've already slept with
Mr. Perfect over here.

1385
01:07:34.221 --> 01:07:36.024
- I'm not perfect.
- As a matter of fact. I haven't.

1386
01:07:36.123 --> 01:07:37.224
But you know what?

1387
01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:39.192
Yeah. I've thought about it.

1388
01:07:39.293 --> 01:07:42.964
I mean. who wouldn't want that
kind of fiery. sparky love?

1389
01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:44.532
- Hell yeah.
- No.

1390
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.869
I guess everyone's been right then.

1391
01:07:47.969 --> 01:07:49.136
About what. Larry?

1392
01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:51.739
That you never loved me
the way that you loved him.

1393
01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:55.208
That I was just a consolation prize.

1394
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.418
Well. I. uh...

1395
01:08:05.753 --> 01:08:08.823
[breathes shakily] I know
he would never lie to me.

1396
01:08:08.923 --> 01:08:09.924
- Oh. really?
- Yeah.

1397
01:08:10.024 --> 01:08:11.593
Do you know that he dyes his hair?

1398
01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:14.094
And do you know that he's got a-a
worryingly large porn collection?

1399
01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:15.262
Oh. Jesus Christ. Larry.

1400
01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:17.197
I know about the
<i>Playboy</i> s in the garage.

1401
01:08:17.297 --> 01:08:18.733
Coasters. coasters. Tell
her about the coasters.

1402
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.100
Yes. and the coasters.

1403
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.537
He's got a. uh. a basket of
coasters with ladies' numbers on 'em.

1404
01:08:22.637 --> 01:08:24.005
Okay... What is he talking about?

1405
01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:25.907
What is he talking about? He's
talking about breaking and entering.

1406
01:08:26.007 --> 01:08:28.009
No. see. He's being... He's very...

1407
01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:29.510
- He's slippery.
- Oh. yeah?

1408
01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:31.445
He's a snake and he's
being purposefully vague.

1409
01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:33.246
Yeah. like how he was with "the war."

1410
01:08:33.347 --> 01:08:34.816
Ignore them. Luke. You're perfect.

1411
01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.350
[screaming]

1412
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:42.189
- He's unhinged.
- You okay. babe?

1413
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:45.693
I'm not perfect. okay?
Yes. I dye my hair.

1414
01:08:45.793 --> 01:08:48.997
And yes. I slept with a few
women over the last 60 years.

1415
01:08:49.097 --> 01:08:50.665
Oh. okay. I mean. that's understandable.

1416
01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:53.034
And one guy. One guy.

1417
01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:54.501
- [Anna] Don't lie.
- Two.

1418
01:08:54.602 --> 01:08:55.937
Two guys. Just to see. Both times.

1419
01:08:56.037 --> 01:08:59.272
And I went through that BDSM
phase about 30 years ago--

1420
01:08:59.373 --> 01:09:00.908
Yes. you did. I remember
it like it was yesterday.

1421
01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:02.275
- [cheers]
- Yeah. me too.

1422
01:09:02.376 --> 01:09:03.443
Was fun. but n-not for me.

1423
01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:06.047
I didn't expect you to be
a-a priest for so long--

1424
01:09:06.146 --> 01:09:08.850
And I think I was beginning to bald
when I died. I-I-I comb it over.

1425
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.151
Whatever. You keep saying I'm
perfect. you keep saying I'm perfect.

1426
01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:13.955
everyone keeps saying I'm perfect.
I am not perfect. Nobody is perfect.

1427
01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:15.523
Finally. Thank you.

1428
01:09:15.623 --> 01:09:16.591
But I did wait.

1429
01:09:17.257 --> 01:09:19.259
I waited for you. Joanie.

1430
01:09:22.362 --> 01:09:24.164
He should at least lose
some points for all the sex.

1431
01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:26.034
God. this is not a competition. Larry.

1432
01:09:26.134 --> 01:09:27.635
- [both] Yes. it is!
- [Anna] Sweetheart.

1433
01:09:27.735 --> 01:09:29.704
- It is 100%. for sure a competition.
- It is in fact a competition.

1434
01:09:29.804 --> 01:09:32.807
- That's literally what we're here for.
- Look. Joan.

1435
01:09:33.574 --> 01:09:36.978
I'm done with the games. You need
to decide if it's me or if it's him.

1436
01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:38.813
Yeah. you need to make a decision.

1437
01:09:39.312 --> 01:09:40.848
- [Luke] Who's it gonna be?
- [Larry] Which one?

1438
01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:43.316
[Luke] It's gotta be one
of us. You gotta pick.

1439
01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.820
I-I think we need to give
my client some time to think.

1440
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.488
Let's just go for a walk.
Let her breathe a little.

1441
01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:54.327
[Ryan] Let's get you
boys something to drink.

1442
01:09:54.428 --> 01:09:56.196
- [Anna] A drink sounds nice. right?
- [door opens]

1443
01:09:56.564 --> 01:09:57.665
[Ryan] Something stiff.

1444
01:09:58.733 --> 01:09:59.667
[door closes]

1445
01:09:59.767 --> 01:10:01.201
[sighs]

1446
01:10:09.577 --> 01:10:11.344
- [insects chirping]
- [knocks on door]

1447
01:10:12.013 --> 01:10:13.447
[sighs]

1448
01:10:19.687 --> 01:10:20.788
[groans]

1449
01:10:23.858 --> 01:10:25.593
[sighs]

1450
01:10:28.495 --> 01:10:29.664
God.

1451
01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:34.869
Yeah?

1452
01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.270
I heard you kicked it too.

1453
01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:40.875
[crying]

1454
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:42.844
Sweetie...

1455
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:46.346
Oh...

1456
01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:53.286
Well. I guess there's nothing
more we can do. It's up to her.

1457
01:10:59.392 --> 01:11:00.528
[sighs]

1458
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:03.564
[grunts. sniffs]

1459
01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:06.299
Can I have one of them?

1460
01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:11.404
Just relax and get your
mind off those boys.

1461
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.541
We deserve this.

1462
01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:15.710
You know what's funny
about you being here

1463
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.411
is that you actually knew me
when I was with both of them.

1464
01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:19.914
Oh. for Christ's sake. Joan.

1465
01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.281
- Drink.
- Oh. sure.

1466
01:11:21.381 --> 01:11:23.050
Just... [grunts] Mmm.

1467
01:11:23.151 --> 01:11:27.121
- I got a toast. This one is for Korea.
- Yeah. you're damn right.

1468
01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:29.123
Not enough films made about it.

1469
01:11:29.724 --> 01:11:31.626
Well. except <i>M*A#S*H</i> .

1470
01:11:32.794 --> 01:11:34.896
[blows] What the hell's <i>M*A#S*H</i> ?

1471
01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:36.931
Ah. man. You gotta
watch <i>M*A#S*H</i> .

1472
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:39.667
Then I choose Luke.

1473
01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.702
- Okay.
- No.

1474
01:11:42.637 --> 01:11:43.604
Larry.

1475
01:11:45.706 --> 01:11:46.908
Larry. Okay.

1476
01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:48.810
God. shitty shit!

1477
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.077
I'm so sorry.

1478
01:11:50.178 --> 01:11:51.378
[sighs]

1479
01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:53.681
[chair squeaking]

1480
01:11:53.781 --> 01:11:55.883
- I don't think you're going bald.
- What're you talking about?

1481
01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:56.851
No. It can...

1482
01:11:56.951 --> 01:11:59.486
You can easily pass that
off as a double crown.

1483
01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:00.788
You know what? I appreciate that.

1484
01:12:00.888 --> 01:12:02.557
A-And you're pretty handsome yourself.

1485
01:12:02.657 --> 01:12:04.091
You don't... You don't have to say that.

1486
01:12:04.192 --> 01:12:06.794
You're a catch. Y-Y-You
got that mysterious thing.

1487
01:12:06.894 --> 01:12:10.198
Like. "I'm thinking deep stuff."
And women. they're into that.

1488
01:12:10.298 --> 01:12:13.234
Really? 'Cause I'm
not. I mean. honestly.

1489
01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:16.003
I've been dead. and I haven't once
thought about the meaning of life.

1490
01:12:16.103 --> 01:12:18.506
They're like. "This is it." and I'm
like. "Yeah. that makes sense to me."

1491
01:12:18.606 --> 01:12:20.141
You're smart. Don't overthink it.

1492
01:12:20.241 --> 01:12:23.144
You know who you are. you know what
you want. and you go and get it.

1493
01:12:23.244 --> 01:12:25.445
You start thinking about all
the infinite possibilities.

1494
01:12:25.546 --> 01:12:27.748
and guess what? You never move.

1495
01:12:27.849 --> 01:12:29.951
- She doesn't deserve you.
- And she doesn't deserve you.

1496
01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:33.120
You are smart. you are
handsome. and you're a war hero.

1497
01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:34.589
And you gave her kids.

1498
01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:37.024
- I did.
- I bet you looked after 'em well.

1499
01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:39.227
- Yeah. I did.
- <i>Salud.</i>

1500
01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:43.130
And at first. it was about Luke and me.

1501
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:45.967
And then there were
decisions about Larry and me.

1502
01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:49.402
- And. you know. it was about the kids.
- Are you considering this eternity?

1503
01:12:49.502 --> 01:12:52.740
And. you know. work.
But this one is about me.

1504
01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:54.374
And...

1505
01:12:55.776 --> 01:12:58.646
- [groans]
- You are dead.

1506
01:12:58.746 --> 01:13:01.249
- Jesus. Karen.
- You lived your life.

1507
01:13:01.349 --> 01:13:02.583
and now you're dead.

1508
01:13:02.683 --> 01:13:05.853
You have no obligations to anyone.

1509
01:13:05.953 --> 01:13:08.522
Maybe it's best you
all have a clean slate.

1510
01:13:08.623 --> 01:13:12.026
Uh. i-it's just we have
others interested. and I feel--

1511
01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:14.427
A little less of this.
a little more of this.

1512
01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.396
Thank you. honey.

1513
01:13:16.496 --> 01:13:18.699
- Thank you.
- [Karen] You can go.

1514
01:13:18.799 --> 01:13:20.167
It's just...

1515
01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:23.204
- She's a... [sniffing]
- She's a perfect person.

1516
01:13:23.304 --> 01:13:25.039
She's a perfect person.

1517
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:29.010
[both sobbing]

1518
01:13:31.946 --> 01:13:32.880
Come here.

1519
01:13:40.054 --> 01:13:41.322
[rooster crows]

1520
01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:42.623
[Joan groans]

1521
01:13:44.525 --> 01:13:47.460
[busy signal beeping]

1522
01:13:47.561 --> 01:13:48.829
[knocks on door]

1523
01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:50.665
[Joan] Coming!

1524
01:13:57.672 --> 01:13:59.040
[Joan groaning]

1525
01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:08.549
Do we have a little
headache this morning?

1526
01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.053
I've made my decision.

1527
01:14:12.153 --> 01:14:13.521
[smacks lips] Okay.

1528
01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:16.489
[breathes deeply] I'll
gather your husbands.

1529
01:14:17.024 --> 01:14:18.225
I need a shower.

1530
01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:20.460
Yeah. You do.

1531
01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:23.664
I'm so nervous. Are you guys nervous?

1532
01:14:23.764 --> 01:14:25.366
You should definitely be
nervous. You too. Not to...

1533
01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:27.368
Not to mean that you should be
more nervous than anybody else.

1534
01:14:27.467 --> 01:14:29.203
but I'm just saying there's a
lot of nerves going all around.

1535
01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:31.172
- Hey. Why are you talking so fast?
- Are you nervous?

1536
01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:32.807
Oh. my gosh. 'Cause I'm nervous.

1537
01:14:32.907 --> 01:14:34.875
You guys should both be
shitting yourselves right now.

1538
01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:36.143
- [Larry] Shut up.
- [Anna] Sorry.

1539
01:14:45.553 --> 01:14:47.655
My client has reached her decision.

1540
01:14:53.728 --> 01:14:56.297
Love is a bond greater than death.

1541
01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:57.898
- [Anna] Mm-hmm.
-  Oh.

1542
01:14:57.999 --> 01:15:02.303
But some bonds are. well.
better bonded. [inhales deeply]

1543
01:15:02.403 --> 01:15:06.040
You have your ionic bonds.
you have your covalent bonds.

1544
01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.074
Your savings bonds.

1545
01:15:07.174 --> 01:15:09.577
- Bail bonds. You--
- Yeah. Okay. That's good.

1546
01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:11.278
- That's great. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1547
01:15:11.379 --> 01:15:12.613
[breathes heavily] Okay.

1548
01:15:16.884 --> 01:15:18.219
[breathing shakily] Okay.

1549
01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:21.088
So. Larry.

1550
01:15:21.522 --> 01:15:23.657
My first morning without you. I...

1551
01:15:24.859 --> 01:15:26.460
God. I hoped it was a bad dream.

1552
01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:29.397
I-I smelled your toast
burning downstairs.

1553
01:15:29.497 --> 01:15:30.598
I...

1554
01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:33.000
I heard the rattle of
the back door and...

1555
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.902
You know. I even...

1556
01:15:35.002 --> 01:15:37.838
I even threw your pillows
on the ground the way...

1557
01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:40.474
the way you always did and...

1558
01:15:40.975 --> 01:15:42.810
You know. I was pretending...

1559
01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:45.846
- [breathes shakily]
- It's okay. honey.

1560
01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:49.483
[breathes shakily] And.
uh. the funny thing is...

1561
01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:51.585
is that I... I felt that before.

1562
01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:53.320
[swallows] When. uh...

1563
01:15:53.421 --> 01:15:55.790
[inhales shakily] When Luke died.

1564
01:15:57.491 --> 01:16:02.163
We never had a chance to see
where our love would take us.

1565
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:07.902
But you gave me everything that
I needed in the time we had.

1566
01:16:09.904 --> 01:16:10.871
Yeah.

1567
01:16:12.973 --> 01:16:14.075
So...

1568
01:16:14.175 --> 01:16:15.643
God. how lucky am I...

1569
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:19.747
[chuckles] ...to have
had you both. you know?

1570
01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:27.254
And. uh. maybe things worked
out the way they were meant to.

1571
01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:30.825
Hmm.

1572
01:16:30.925 --> 01:16:33.060
S-So. what are you... What
are you saying? I don't...

1573
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.095
[breathes shakily]

1574
01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:37.631
I'm saying. um...

1575
01:16:39.467 --> 01:16:40.668
that I choose...

1576
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:49.210
[inhales shakily] I
choose neither of you.

1577
01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:52.646
- You choose neither of us?
- You're kidding. right?

1578
01:16:52.746 --> 01:16:54.248
So. you're gonna hurt
three people instead of one?

1579
01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:57.218
No. there was never
going to... to be one.

1580
01:16:57.318 --> 01:16:58.352
Don't you get it?

1581
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.323
I was going to be crushed either way.

1582
01:17:02.423 --> 01:17:04.058
But we built a life together.

1583
01:17:04.158 --> 01:17:07.394
Well. yeah. Maybe the
beauty in life is that...

1584
01:17:08.329 --> 01:17:10.498
Is that things end.

1585
01:17:11.332 --> 01:17:14.902
You know? Maybe that's what...
[smacks lips] ...this is all for.

1586
01:17:15.402 --> 01:17:16.737
So...

1587
01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:22.209
So. I choose neither of you.

1588
01:17:25.045 --> 01:17:26.914
Yeah. Okay.

1589
01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:32.353
[sobs]

1590
01:17:57.811 --> 01:17:59.313
[electrical buzzing]

1591
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:11.626
Why do we even bother?
I mean. do we help?

1592
01:18:12.259 --> 01:18:15.262
- Do we make a difference?
- Of course we make a difference.

1593
01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:16.764
We annoy them.

1594
01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:18.332
They've just died.

1595
01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:19.700
They're scared.

1596
01:18:20.267 --> 01:18:23.103
It's better to be
annoyed than to be scared.

1597
01:18:23.538 --> 01:18:24.705
Right?

1598
01:18:34.683 --> 01:18:36.183
You sure about this?

1599
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:38.452
Oh. yeah. I'm sure.

1600
01:18:39.554 --> 01:18:41.822
Well. let's go. [chuckles]

1601
01:18:47.428 --> 01:18:50.397
[Larry] <i>You were right. by the
way. Even my proposal was about you.</i>

1602
01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:53.834
You were the ghost I
could never compete with.

1603
01:18:54.301 --> 01:18:55.269
No.

1604
01:18:56.303 --> 01:18:59.240
Do you have any idea
how jealous I am of you?

1605
01:19:00.642 --> 01:19:02.343
You got to have a life with her.

1606
01:19:05.112 --> 01:19:07.915
Hey. you know you were the
last thing I saw before I died?

1607
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:10.818
What do you mean?

1608
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:15.690
[sighs] I was eating a pretzel
and my great-granddaughter--

1609
01:19:15.789 --> 01:19:16.924
- Charlotte?
- Yeah.

1610
01:19:18.292 --> 01:19:22.530
Shows me this old picture of
you and Joan on your wedding day.

1611
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.099
And then I started choking.

1612
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.907
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

1613
01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:38.979
Yeah. I gotta admit. you
weren't who I was expecting.

1614
01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:40.781
You're exactly what I was expecting.

1615
01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:44.184
Minus the porn and hair dye.

1616
01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:49.823
About six months before I died. I was...

1617
01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:54.228
I was graying at the temples
and. you know. I just didn't care.

1618
01:19:56.063 --> 01:20:00.501
'Cause Joan and I. we'd just had this
conversation about starting a family.

1619
01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:06.307
Everything was laid out in front of us.

1620
01:20:08.108 --> 01:20:10.377
[inhales deeply] That was my happiest.

1621
01:20:15.182 --> 01:20:16.551
I'm 35.

1622
01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:23.057
Joan was pregnant with our second
and we went out to dinner one night.

1623
01:20:24.491 --> 01:20:27.161
The doctor was telling us
about all these new studies

1624
01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:29.597
where you're not supposed to
drink when you're pregnant.

1625
01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:34.001
And I got my glass of wine
and Joan took a sip of it.

1626
01:20:35.637 --> 01:20:38.807
and she just had this
little smile on her face.

1627
01:20:39.674 --> 01:20:46.447
And I don't know but. in that moment.
it just felt like we were a team.

1628
01:20:58.727 --> 01:20:59.794
You okay?

1629
01:20:59.927 --> 01:21:02.329
Oh. my God. [swallows] I have to go.

1630
01:21:11.773 --> 01:21:12.940
- [grunts]
- What's going on?

1631
01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.375
Your AC will explain everything.

1632
01:21:14.475 --> 01:21:16.110
What's an AC?

1633
01:21:20.815 --> 01:21:21.982
[exclaims]

1634
01:21:29.323 --> 01:21:32.794
We can go to this café on
the Seine where a fake Sartre

1635
01:21:32.893 --> 01:21:37.898
and fake Camus have a fight and they have
great <i>pain au chocolat</i> .

1636
01:21:38.265 --> 01:21:40.835
[Joan] Was Camus the one who
always talked about death?

1637
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.237
'Cause that just kinda
sounds pointless now.

1638
01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:44.438
Really?

1639
01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:47.474
You know. I read <i>Sartre
For Beginners</i> .

1640
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.144
How do you say Sartre?

1641
01:21:50.244 --> 01:21:52.179
- Sar... Sartre.
- Sartre.

1642
01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:53.548
And--

1643
01:21:53.914 --> 01:21:55.182
What's Larry doing here?

1644
01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:56.250
I...

1645
01:21:58.986 --> 01:22:00.421
[sighs]

1646
01:22:06.994 --> 01:22:10.264
- Please. Larry. I made up my mind. okay?
- Yeah.

1647
01:22:10.364 --> 01:22:13.367
- You know this is best. Okay?
- Your hair is different.

1648
01:22:14.968 --> 01:22:17.337
- Okay. Thank you.
- [clears throat] No.

1649
01:22:17.438 --> 01:22:20.474
Y-You never had it like
that when we were together.

1650
01:22:20.575 --> 01:22:22.544
No. I-I cut it after...

1651
01:22:25.078 --> 01:22:26.548
It suits you.

1652
01:22:27.782 --> 01:22:28.949
Larry.

1653
01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:31.586
You should go with Luke.

1654
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.290
Okay? You deserve a shot
at that kind of love. honey.

1655
01:22:36.658 --> 01:22:40.093
That fiery. sparky kind.

1656
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:44.699
[inhales shakily] But I
was so. so happy with you.

1657
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.168
I... [stammers] I know.

1658
01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:50.103
But you were happiest with him.

1659
01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:54.843
- [clicks tongue] It's okay.
- B-But what... What about you?

1660
01:22:54.943 --> 01:22:56.544
[breathes heavily]

1661
01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:59.480
D-Don't worry about
me. I'll be in the sun.

1662
01:23:00.949 --> 01:23:02.951
Knowing you're happy makes me happy.

1663
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:04.384
[sniffles]

1664
01:23:05.018 --> 01:23:07.321
But it doesn't work unless you're happy.

1665
01:23:09.858 --> 01:23:11.225
Oh. Larry.

1666
01:23:19.466 --> 01:23:20.735
[Larry sniffles]

1667
01:23:22.971 --> 01:23:24.104
[Joan] Okay.

1668
01:23:24.204 --> 01:23:27.174
You better go break the
news to Karen. [chuckles]

1669
01:23:27.876 --> 01:23:29.109
Okay.

1670
01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:31.713
Okay.

1671
01:23:34.916 --> 01:23:36.751
- Okay.
- It's the right thing.

1672
01:23:37.417 --> 01:23:38.720
[Joan] Wow.

1673
01:23:46.393 --> 01:23:47.427
[sighs]

1674
01:23:56.838 --> 01:23:57.805
[sniffles]

1675
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:55.597

[announcer] <i>The train doors</i>
<i>will close in 30 minutes.</i>

1677
01:25:07.942 --> 01:25:10.477
[Ryan] Babe. we shouldn't flaunt
our sexy love in front of his face.

1678
01:25:10.578 --> 01:25:11.946
He has no one.

1679

- Hey.
- Hi.

1680
01:25:13.246 --> 01:25:14.281
[chuckles]

1681
01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:15.883
How are you holding up. Lar?

1682
01:25:15.984 --> 01:25:17.986
Eh. I'm all right.

1683
01:25:18.086 --> 01:25:19.887
No hard feelings.
right. Larry? [chuckles]

1684
01:25:19.988 --> 01:25:22.757
For what it's worth. I totally
thought you had it there for a moment.

1685
01:25:22.857 --> 01:25:24.157
Thanks.

1686
01:25:25.425 --> 01:25:27.629
What's this? Are you two together now?

1687
01:25:27.729 --> 01:25:30.832
- [sucks teeth] Yeah. [giggles]
- We're gonna give it another go.

1688
01:25:30.932 --> 01:25:32.199
Good.

1689
01:25:32.299 --> 01:25:35.003
You really showed us that living
without someone is a hollow mess.

1690
01:25:35.103 --> 01:25:37.005
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1691
01:25:37.105 --> 01:25:38.539
- Okay.
- [Anna] Give us a minute. please.

1692
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.208
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Totally.
I miss you already.

1693
01:25:41.308 --> 01:25:43.377
God. [chuckles. grunts]

1694
01:25:45.813 --> 01:25:46.748
You wanna?

1695
01:25:54.254 --> 01:25:55.623
[sighs]

1696
01:25:56.289 --> 01:25:59.794
I gotta say. I'm really
proud of you. Larry.

1697
01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:02.162
You're doing the right thing.

1698
01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.565
I feel terrible.

1699
01:26:05.399 --> 01:26:07.501
Yeah. That happens.

1700
01:26:07.969 --> 01:26:10.571
Sometimes doing the right
thing does feel terrible.

1701
01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:16.309
So. you never told me why
you ended up staying here.

1702
01:26:19.013 --> 01:26:20.515
Um. coming here...

1703
01:26:23.417 --> 01:26:26.654
I'll just say that coming
here was an improvement for me.

1704
01:26:27.855 --> 01:26:31.859
Here. I get to help lost
souls find their happiness.

1705
01:26:33.161 --> 01:26:35.530
And that gives me a sense of purpose.

1706
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:39.567
But after time. you stop caring
about what's best for people.

1707
01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:41.536
You're just pushing them along

1708
01:26:41.636 --> 01:26:45.573
and making sure the afterlife
is ticking over. you know?

1709
01:26:45.673 --> 01:26:46.708
Sell. sell. sell.

1710
01:26:49.342 --> 01:26:51.646
But then you came along.

1711
01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.650
Yeah. With that great ordinary love.

1712
01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:00.253
And you reminded me of
why I chose this place.

1713
01:27:01.089 --> 01:27:03.223
So. thank you for that. Larry.

1714
01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:08.428
- Well. I guess you're welcome.
- [chuckles]

1715
01:27:13.968 --> 01:27:15.402
- [sighs]
- So...

1716
01:27:18.673 --> 01:27:20.675
have you chosen your eternity?

1717
01:27:24.112 --> 01:27:26.446
Yeah. I think I have.

1718
01:27:38.593 --> 01:27:40.228
- Okay. Come on.
- What?

1719
01:27:40.327 --> 01:27:42.130
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh. God. Oh. no.

1720
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:44.297
- Oh. yeah. Oh. yeah.
- [laughing]

1721
01:27:45.298 --> 01:27:46.466
Oh. boy.

1722
01:27:47.367 --> 01:27:48.870
- Oh.
- Hey.

1723
01:27:49.402 --> 01:27:51.038
- Yeah.
- It's not bad. huh?

1724
01:27:51.139 --> 01:27:52.339
Oh. it's...

1725
01:27:55.143 --> 01:27:56.276
It's very charming.

1726
01:27:59.947 --> 01:28:01.783
Shit. [laughing]

1727
01:28:02.917 --> 01:28:03.885
- A car crash.
- Oh.

1728
01:28:03.985 --> 01:28:06.053
Uh. old age. Cancer.

1729
01:28:06.587 --> 01:28:09.023
- War.
- Oh. War. Which one?

1730
01:28:09.123 --> 01:28:11.626
- I or II?
- Um. Korea.

1731
01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:13.426
- Which counts. Yeah.
- Oh.

1732
01:28:14.028 --> 01:28:15.930
[both speaking French]

1733
01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.070
Well done.

1734
01:28:23.171 --> 01:28:24.337
Thank you.

1735
01:28:26.274 --> 01:28:27.942
[panting]

1736
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:32.580
I love you so much.

1737
01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:34.849
So much.

1738
01:28:46.027 --> 01:28:47.028
[sighs]

1739
01:29:14.387 --> 01:29:16.257
- [Larry] Hey.
- [Joan] Hi.

1740
01:29:16.356 --> 01:29:19.594
Uh. so you like books?

1741
01:29:21.662 --> 01:29:23.331
Uh. yeah. I'm a librarian. so...

1742
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:24.632
Can I help you with something?

1743
01:29:24.732 --> 01:29:26.033
- Yeah. I can read.
- [chuckles]

1744
01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:28.102
[Joan] That's good.
You're in the right place.

1745
01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:31.504
- What's that one?
- That's Dickens. <i>Great Expectations</i> .

1746
01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:33.140
Any good?

1747
01:29:34.141 --> 01:29:36.010
Um. you know. I haven't read it.

1748
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:38.445
But that's 'cause I
don't really love Dickens.

1749
01:29:38.546 --> 01:29:39.747
- Oh.
- It's a big controversy.

1750
01:29:39.847 --> 01:29:42.750
- Yeah. I hate him.
- [laughs]

1751
01:29:44.318 --> 01:29:45.920
You got a... You got a nice laugh.

1752
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.555
Oh. thank you. [laughing]

1753
01:29:50.258 --> 01:29:51.692
- I'm Joan.
- Larry.

1754
01:29:51.792 --> 01:29:53.460
- Nice to meet you. Larry.
- Nice to meet you.

1755
01:29:53.561 --> 01:29:55.696
[strains] Okay.

1756
01:29:56.631 --> 01:29:59.499
[panting] Okay.

1757
01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.535
- That's it. slow and steady.
- Okay.

1758
01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:04.238
[panting] Okay.

1759
01:30:04.338 --> 01:30:05.840
Keep up the good work. Joan.

1760
01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.142
Oh. yeah. Thanks. Simon.
[whispers] Go fuck yourself.

1761
01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:09.409
[pants]

1762
01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:11.679
- It's good.
- [Luke] Yeah. really good.

1763
01:30:11.779 --> 01:30:13.147
- Oh. it feels good.
- Come on. let's go.

1764
01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:14.414
Okay.

1765
01:30:16.384 --> 01:30:18.418
[whistling]

1766
01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.455
[baby crying]

1767
01:30:23.456 --> 01:30:24.659
[Larry] What is that?

1768
01:30:26.027 --> 01:30:27.128
Who's that?

1769
01:30:27.228 --> 01:30:28.863
[crying continues]

1770
01:30:28.963 --> 01:30:31.599
How is it that he already
needs to poop again?

1771
01:30:31.699 --> 01:30:33.433
Four months old and he's
already shitting like a man.

1772
01:30:33.534 --> 01:30:34.969
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

1773
01:30:35.468 --> 01:30:37.171
- [Joan] Oh. honey.
- [Larry] What's that?

1774
01:30:37.271 --> 01:30:38.205
[Joan] You stink.

1775
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:45.112
- [laughing]
- Janet. Connor. Connor. Janet.

1776
01:30:45.212 --> 01:30:47.882
- They died doing a... What--
- Gender reveal party.

1777
01:30:47.982 --> 01:30:49.984
- Yeah. Gender reveal party.
- Yeah. There was so much blood.

1778
01:30:50.084 --> 01:30:51.419
Everywhere. Just oozing.

1779
01:30:51.519 --> 01:30:53.087
We didn't see it coming.
We'd al... We looked in.

1780
01:30:53.187 --> 01:30:54.655
We were like. "Oh.
what's going on in here?"

1781
01:30:54.755 --> 01:30:55.990
Boom! Blew our heads right off.

1782
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:57.658
- I love it when you do that.
- Whoa.

1783
01:31:04.165 --> 01:31:05.700
Thank you. Fenwick.

1784
01:31:11.138 --> 01:31:12.573
[sighs]

1785
01:31:14.008 --> 01:31:16.544
Are you sure you don't wanna
come? The powder's fresh. J-Bae.

1786
01:31:16.644 --> 01:31:18.478
Oh. I got plenty of powder yesterday.

1787
01:31:18.579 --> 01:31:20.581
- Powdered out. So...
- You sure?

1788
01:31:20.681 --> 01:31:22.550
- Uh-huh. Have fun.
-  Okay. Give me a kiss.

1789
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:23.651
- Okay.
- I love you.

1790
01:31:23.751 --> 01:31:25.286
- I love you too. Bye.
- Bye.

1791
01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:26.486
- [giggles]
- Cute.

1792
01:31:27.955 --> 01:31:29.623
- [Luke] You sure?
- [chuckles]

1793
01:31:34.929 --> 01:31:39.667
You know. people die at these
things? I saw it on the Internet.

1794
01:31:40.468 --> 01:31:43.904
- [laughs] It's a gender reveal party.
- They're lethal and stupid.

1795
01:31:44.005 --> 01:31:45.906
[older Joan] Oh. just
let 'em make a fuss.

1796
01:31:46.007 --> 01:31:49.310
[older Larry] I mean. I get. you
know. eliminating the surprise

1797
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:50.811
but it's not party-worthy.

1798
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:52.680
[older Joan] You know. one
of the great joys of my life

1799
01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.315
has been allowing for surprises.

1800
01:31:54.415 --> 01:31:58.319
Remember when you were
convinced that Zach was a girl?

1801
01:31:58.419 --> 01:32:01.122
[older Larry] Well. everything
has to be a party nowadays.

1802
01:32:01.222 --> 01:32:03.457
- [older Joan] You hate parties.
- Everything has to be an event.

1803
01:32:03.557 --> 01:32:05.726
[older Joan] No. no.
You hate having fun.

1804
01:32:05.826 --> 01:32:07.795
[older Larry] You know. kids
have preschool graduations now.

1805
01:32:07.895 --> 01:32:09.730
You haven't achieved anything yet.

1806
01:32:10.965 --> 01:32:13.100
Can we just... Can we just enjoy it?

1807
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:18.272
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- [sighs] Look. lady.

1808
01:32:18.372 --> 01:32:20.841
It's not too healthy to be
coming back here all the time.

1809
01:32:21.842 --> 01:32:23.911
It's important to move on.

1810
01:32:26.113 --> 01:32:27.214
Mmm.

1811
01:32:31.152 --> 01:32:32.686
[fire crackling]

1812
01:32:32.787 --> 01:32:34.088
This is perfect. huh?

1813
01:32:36.257 --> 01:32:37.491
Huh?

1814
01:32:37.858 --> 01:32:39.060
[smacks lips. stammers]

1815
01:32:41.729 --> 01:32:42.897
You're okay?

1816
01:32:44.999 --> 01:32:46.133
Yeah.

1817
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.302
- Yeah?
- Just a little cold.

1818
01:32:50.738 --> 01:32:52.840
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1819
01:33:07.855 --> 01:33:10.224
I booked us on a hot
air balloon later on.

1820
01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.629
And. uh. there's a new
couple in... in unit nine.

1821
01:33:15.729 --> 01:33:17.566
I think they'd. uh... Ooh.

1822
01:33:17.665 --> 01:33:19.400
I think they'd make
great doubles partners.

1823
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.269
If I meet any more new
people. I'm going to explode.

1824
01:33:24.772 --> 01:33:26.841
And then what would you complain about?

1825
01:33:27.509 --> 01:33:28.609
- What?
- [scoffs] Come on. Joanie.

1826
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:30.177
you love to complain.

1827
01:33:31.078 --> 01:33:33.614
That's not a thing people love.

1828
01:33:36.217 --> 01:33:37.218
You okay?

1829
01:33:38.352 --> 01:33:39.920
I made a mistake.

1830
01:33:41.822 --> 01:33:43.624
Did you lose your skis again?

1831
01:33:46.894 --> 01:33:49.663
No. I. uh... [inhales shakily]

1832
01:33:53.568 --> 01:33:55.903
I made a mistake
coming h-here with you.

1833
01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:04.812
Okay.

1834
01:34:06.247 --> 01:34:07.114
What'd I do wrong now?

1835
01:34:07.214 --> 01:34:09.150
Nothing. Oh. nothing.
No. you're perfect.

1836
01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:12.286
I know you say you're
not b-but you are.

1837
01:34:12.386 --> 01:34:16.390
You're kind and brave and
smart. That's how I know.

1838
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:19.393
I waited all these years for this.

1839
01:34:20.327 --> 01:34:21.530
This.

1840
01:34:22.329 --> 01:34:25.299
Why can't you just enjoy it?
We're in a literal paradise.

1841
01:34:25.399 --> 01:34:28.836
Yeah. I'm sorry I
didn't realize it sooner.

1842
01:34:28.936 --> 01:34:30.504
I think I just... I think I just

1843
01:34:30.605 --> 01:34:32.706
- got really caught up in everything.
- Joanie. what the...

1844
01:34:32.806 --> 01:34:34.708
And maybe it would've
worked between us in life.

1845
01:34:34.808 --> 01:34:36.243
You know? Maybe not.

1846
01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:38.979
But I-I can't pretend that my
world didn't continue without you.

1847
01:34:39.079 --> 01:34:42.551
I am not asking you to. I
have never asked it of you.

1848
01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:45.152
- Unlike you. I don't hide things.
- Well. what's that supposed to mean?

1849
01:34:45.252 --> 01:34:49.190
I grit my teeth every single day
so you can go to that damn tunnel.

1850
01:34:54.428 --> 01:34:57.364
[huffs] Joanie. we
were happiest together.

1851
01:34:57.464 --> 01:34:59.366
Yeah. Of course we were.

1852
01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.536
It was young love. It was...

1853
01:35:01.636 --> 01:35:06.575
It was love without the burden
of a mortgage or a job or kids.

1854
01:35:06.675 --> 01:35:09.710
It was. you know. the kind of
love you feel before knowing loss.

1855
01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:11.412
It was everything. but...

1856
01:35:12.846 --> 01:35:14.448
Love isn't just one happy moment.

1857
01:35:14.549 --> 01:35:16.183
Right? It's a million.

1858
01:35:16.283 --> 01:35:20.988
And it's bickering in the car. and
supporting someone when they need it.

1859
01:35:21.088 --> 01:35:24.058
and it's growing together.
and looking after each other.

1860
01:35:24.158 --> 01:35:26.794
We can grow together now. We
can look after each other now.

1861
01:35:26.894 --> 01:35:29.430
I mean. Luke. Honestly?

1862
01:35:29.531 --> 01:35:31.799
Am I living up to the memory?

1863
01:35:34.201 --> 01:35:38.772
You waited so long in
that... that artificial place.

1864
01:35:38.872 --> 01:35:41.108
but here. this is real.

1865
01:35:41.676 --> 01:35:43.545
And... And you're living and...

1866
01:35:44.078 --> 01:35:47.214
I'm giving you permission.
Go live without me.

1867
01:35:47.314 --> 01:35:49.316
Oh. you're giving me
permission? Are you...

1868
01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:50.918
- Are you giving me permission?
- Okay. I'm sorry.

1869
01:35:51.018 --> 01:35:53.254
- That was a little condescending.
- Thank you so much. my Highness.

1870
01:35:53.354 --> 01:35:54.522
- I'm your humble servant.
- Okay.

1871
01:35:54.623 --> 01:35:57.124
- Thank you so much for the permission.
- I'm sorry.

1872
01:35:59.393 --> 01:36:01.128
This is not fair.

1873
01:36:03.197 --> 01:36:04.599
[inhales deeply]

1874
01:36:04.699 --> 01:36:05.833
It's not fair.

1875
01:36:07.234 --> 01:36:08.202
I know.

1876
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:10.938
But...

1877
01:36:12.707 --> 01:36:13.708
I have to go back.

1878
01:36:13.807 --> 01:36:15.342
You out of your mind?

1879
01:36:15.442 --> 01:36:18.312
The moment you step through
a red door. they'll find you.

1880
01:36:19.714 --> 01:36:21.549
They'll put you into the void.

1881
01:36:22.249 --> 01:36:23.250
I have to try.

1882
01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:27.821
No. you don't. You
can stay here with me.

1883
01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:33.494
Please stay.

1884
01:36:38.767 --> 01:36:40.000
Please stay.

1885
01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.274
I'm sorry.

1886
01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:52.313
[swallows] I really do love you.

1887
01:36:58.252 --> 01:36:59.320
[Luke sighs]

1888
01:37:03.891 --> 01:37:05.092
[sniffles]

1889
01:37:37.559 --> 01:37:38.859
Okay.

1890
01:37:39.326 --> 01:37:40.595
[huffs]

1891
01:37:41.028 --> 01:37:44.599
Hands up. Fenwick. Give me the keys. You
got it. Joanie. You've got it. Joanie.

1892
01:37:44.699 --> 01:37:46.467
Yeah. Stick 'em up. stick 'em up.

1893
01:37:46.568 --> 01:37:47.702
Stick 'em up. Fenny.

1894
01:37:47.802 --> 01:37:50.304
Are you ready to die. Fenny? You
want me to cut you? I'll cut...

1895
01:37:50.404 --> 01:37:51.238
Oh. God.

1896
01:37:51.338 --> 01:37:53.173
Such a sweet boy. He's so sweet.

1897
01:37:53.273 --> 01:37:55.976
Unless I do some... Okay. Yeah.

1898
01:37:56.076 --> 01:37:57.878
[Luke] You know that won't work.

1899
01:37:59.781 --> 01:38:01.048
[scoffs] I mean...

1900
01:38:02.416 --> 01:38:03.618
it might.

1901
01:38:07.354 --> 01:38:08.455
[sighs]

1902
01:38:13.894 --> 01:38:15.162
[sighs]

1903
01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.635
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1904
01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:25.305
You're gonna need a distraction.

1905
01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:30.444
Luke...

1906
01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.113
I'm so sorry.

1907
01:38:33.914 --> 01:38:35.315
Yeah.

1908
01:38:35.983 --> 01:38:37.184
I know.

1909
01:38:39.821 --> 01:38:41.121
[sighs]

1910
01:38:43.725 --> 01:38:46.528
So. you remember how I used
to do some local theater?

1911
01:38:52.901 --> 01:38:55.002
[breathing heavily]

1912
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:05.880
Please don't touch the exhibits.
Remember the exhibits aren't real.

1913
01:39:05.979 --> 01:39:07.314
[slurs] She left.

1914
01:39:09.717 --> 01:39:13.020
- Why? [sobbing]
- Oh. buddy.

1915
01:39:13.588 --> 01:39:16.323
- [shouting]
- [yelps] I know. I know it's tough.

1916
01:39:16.423 --> 01:39:17.357
I know. I know.

1917
01:39:17.458 --> 01:39:18.992
But... B-But trust
me. it'll get better.

1918
01:39:19.092 --> 01:39:23.063
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah. that's
right. J-Just let it out. big guy.

1919
01:39:23.163 --> 01:39:26.634
Let it out. Let it out. Let it all out.

1920
01:39:26.734 --> 01:39:28.335
Okay? It's okay. It's okay.

1921
01:39:28.435 --> 01:39:30.638
It's tough today. b-but
there's always tomorrow.

1922
01:39:30.738 --> 01:39:32.473
It's tough today. there's
always tomorrow. huh?

1923
01:39:32.574 --> 01:39:34.341
- That's right. That's right. Okay.
- Okay. good.

1924
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:36.043
I just needed a good cry. I think.

1925
01:39:36.143 --> 01:39:37.444
Yeah. I get that.

1926
01:39:37.545 --> 01:39:39.446
- I remember when my old lady dumped--
- Anyway. thanks.

1927
01:39:39.547 --> 01:39:42.817
I'm gonna pop in for. uh...
[sniffles] For old time's sake.

1928
01:39:43.484 --> 01:39:45.486
Yeah. but y-you didn't take a ticket.

1929
01:39:48.155 --> 01:39:50.390
I need to stop being such a giver.

1930
01:40:03.638 --> 01:40:05.740
[inhales sharply] You should hurry up.

1931
01:40:07.307 --> 01:40:08.275
Yeah.

1932
01:40:10.879 --> 01:40:12.112
Goodbye. Luke.

1933
01:40:14.147 --> 01:40:15.349
Goodbye. Joan.

1934
01:40:18.553 --> 01:40:19.521
Yeah.

1935
01:41:05.633 --> 01:41:06.701
[baby cries]

1936
01:41:09.804 --> 01:41:12.272
- Honey. it was the last time. I promise.
- No.

1937
01:41:12.372 --> 01:41:14.742
Will you please just calm
down and let's discuss this?

1938
01:41:14.842 --> 01:41:16.778
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down!
- [security] There she is!

1939
01:41:16.878 --> 01:41:17.812
Stop right there!

1940
01:41:17.912 --> 01:41:19.814
- You are not taking my child!
- What do you care?

1941
01:41:19.914 --> 01:41:22.684
- [Joan's mom] Get in here right now!
- [security] Stop her! Stop her!

1942
01:41:22.784 --> 01:41:23.751
[Joan's mom] I hate you!

1943
01:41:23.851 --> 01:41:25.452
...you would treat me like that?

1944
01:41:26.219 --> 01:41:29.891
- [sobbing] What if I'm pregnant?
- It'll be okay. Joanie. I promise.

1945
01:41:30.457 --> 01:41:31.826
[man] I'm sorry. the check bounced.

1946
01:41:31.926 --> 01:41:33.193
[young Joan] Please.

1947
01:41:33.293 --> 01:41:34.729
- I love you.
- [young Luke] I love you.

1948
01:41:34.829 --> 01:41:36.330
[whistle blowing]

1949
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:37.899
- [young Joan sobbing]
- [security] There's nowhere to go!

1950
01:41:38.332 --> 01:41:41.168
- [police] We're sorry for your loss.
- [young Joan sobbing] No. no. no. no.

1951
01:41:42.737 --> 01:41:44.137
[whistle blowing]

1952
01:41:44.504 --> 01:41:46.608
[security] Come on. come
on. come on! Hurry up!

1953
01:41:50.110 --> 01:41:51.278
Stop!

1954
01:41:54.414 --> 01:41:56.618
[panting. straining]

1955
01:41:59.887 --> 01:42:00.855
Shit.

1956
01:42:08.295 --> 01:42:09.463
[Joan] Jesus. Larry.
I don't wanna--

1957
01:42:09.564 --> 01:42:11.264
I don't wanna have this
conversation again. I am--

1958
01:42:11.365 --> 01:42:13.635
No. I am not. I am not
comparing you to him!

1959
01:42:13.735 --> 01:42:16.971
No. I have never compared you to him!
And I don't wanna have this conversation!

1960
01:42:17.071 --> 01:42:18.271
[Larry] It's humiliating. Joan.

1961
01:42:18.372 --> 01:42:19.674
- I can't do this anymore.
- Don't move!

1962
01:42:19.774 --> 01:42:22.510
[Joan] God. well. she brought
it up. What am I supposed to say?

1963
01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:24.311
I mean. I... I get it.
She doesn't like me.

1964
01:42:24.411 --> 01:42:26.047
- No. no. she literally said...
- You'll grow on her.

1965
01:42:26.146 --> 01:42:27.815
- ..."I don't like him."
- [Joan] You grow on people. Larry.

1966
01:42:27.915 --> 01:42:30.084
[Larry] Great. I'm like
a fungus. I'm a mushroom.

1967
01:42:30.183 --> 01:42:32.553
[Joan. Larry arguing]

1968
01:42:58.211 --> 01:42:59.681
- [bang]
- [security] Upstairs! Upstairs!

1969
01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:00.882
Larry.

1970
01:43:03.685 --> 01:43:04.886
[security] Hurry!

1971
01:43:05.553 --> 01:43:08.089
- Come on. get up. Grab her! Grab her!
- [Joan panting]

1972
01:43:08.188 --> 01:43:11.793
[grunts. panting]

1973

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.702

Excuse me. Hi.

1979
01:43:57.638 --> 01:44:01.609
I-I need to know which

Ma'am. there have been

Could you be more specific?

Oh.

Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.

1987
01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:32.974
You know. I've been
thinking a lot about it and.

1988
01:44:33.074 --> 01:44:37.377
you know. I-I think that maybe
we should consider being poly.

1989
01:44:37.477 --> 01:44:40.114
[hisses] I'm not much
of a multitasker. babe.

1990

- What?
-  I'm a one-woman man.

Oh.

[gasps] Go over there. Over there.

1994
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:50.591
You guys see a woman
come running this way?

1995
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:52.827
- No.
- She went that way.

1996
01:44:52.927 --> 01:44:54.762
- Thanks. Come on. Let's go.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1997

Good luck. you guys.

1998

[Gary] Let's go. Move.

1999
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.168
Joan.

2000
01:45:00.268 --> 01:45:02.003
You're such a romantic.

2001
01:45:02.103 --> 01:45:04.672
We can sneak her into one of
those old. disused eternities.

2002
01:45:04.772 --> 01:45:06.473
Not one of the racist ones.
But you'll be safe there.

2003
01:45:06.574 --> 01:45:08.876
- Security never checks them.
- Where did he go?

2004
01:45:08.976 --> 01:45:09.944
Who?

2005
01:45:10.044 --> 01:45:11.411
Where's Larry?

2006
01:45:11.512 --> 01:45:14.248
[gasps] Oh. my God. I knew
it. I knew it. I knew it.

2007
01:45:14.347 --> 01:45:16.884
- Where is he?
- [Anna squeals]

2008
01:45:47.782 --> 01:45:48.749
Oh.

2009
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:52.053
It's a lot out there. huh?

2010
01:45:53.855 --> 01:45:54.922
Intense.

2011
01:45:55.756 --> 01:45:56.891
Yeah.

2012
01:45:57.258 --> 01:46:00.460
I know somewhere you
could really unwind.

2013
01:46:00.561 --> 01:46:02.597
Come on. Marge. You know the rules.

2014
01:46:02.697 --> 01:46:04.832
I'm just trying to help a girl out.

2015
01:46:05.199 --> 01:46:06.734
I know what I want now.

2016
01:46:08.536 --> 01:46:10.338
I could show you my eternity.

2017
01:46:10.437 --> 01:46:12.540
It's. uh. just around the corner.

2018
01:46:15.475 --> 01:46:16.844
You heard the lady.

2019
01:46:19.513 --> 01:46:21.414
I preferred the last barman.

2020
01:46:28.823 --> 01:46:30.858
You look like you could use a drink.

2021
01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:31.926
Oh.

2022
01:46:34.195 --> 01:46:35.162
Yeah.

2023
01:46:35.963 --> 01:46:37.497
You never left.

2024
01:46:38.232 --> 01:46:39.367
Nah.

2025
01:46:39.466 --> 01:46:42.003
[inhales sharply] Sand
really does get everywhere.

2026
01:46:42.637 --> 01:46:47.074
Yeah. Turns out that
the cold is just cold.

2027
01:46:55.383 --> 01:46:57.952
[swallows. exhales]

2028
01:47:00.021 --> 01:47:01.789
[alarm blaring]

2029
01:47:02.323 --> 01:47:04.491
- Is that for you?
- Oh. yeah.

2030
01:47:04.592 --> 01:47:06.193
I'm kind of a fugitive.

2031
01:47:06.994 --> 01:47:08.029
Where you gonna go?

2032
01:47:10.097 --> 01:47:11.431
I know a place.

2033
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.535
It could be dangerous.

2034
01:47:16.469 --> 01:47:17.905
[gulps]

2035
01:47:20.241 --> 01:47:21.175
[breathes shakily]

2036
01:47:24.679 --> 01:47:26.213
When do we leave?

2037
01:47:26.314 --> 01:47:27.480
[sighs]

2038
01:47:29.417 --> 01:47:30.718
[chuckles]

2039
01:47:40.594 --> 01:47:42.196
- [Joan coughs]
- [Larry coughs]

2040
01:47:53.774 --> 01:47:56.610
Well. looks like Oakdale.

2041
01:47:58.612 --> 01:47:59.747
It's perfect.
