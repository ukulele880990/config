2
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.298
Oh. fuck.

3
00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.883
- Can you get us out of here?
- I can.

4
00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.385
We can finally go home.

5
00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.220
Checkmate.

6
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.056
Oh. don't worry. I cloned her
phone before resetting it.

7
00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.474
I'd be happy to
share its contents.

8
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.309
You just have to
ask me for them.

9
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.728
Now. the
blood work suggests

10
00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.396
your cancer has
stopped metastasizing.

11
00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.355
<i>It could be</i>

12
00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.565
happening again.

13
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.400
<i>The waiter was a sacrifice.</i>

14
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.861
Your new prognosis.
that's the gift.

15
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.280
<i>I-I wanted
you to be proud of me.</i>

16
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.865
Why didn't we know about
this kid in the first place?

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.367
Gen and Melissa
got pretty close to Hannah.

18
00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.369
Yeah. they're both dead.

19
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.538
- Van!
- Oh. my God!

20
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.581
This is an emergency.

21
00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:41.707
She has metastatic cancer.

22
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.001
- She does?
- What?

23
00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:47.337
Let's fucking do this!

24
00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:49.214
- I'm staying.
- This is rescue.

25
00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.092
- No.
- The rest of us. we're going.

26
00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:53.595
You're not.

27
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.599
Bye. love.

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.808
- Love you. Mama.
- I love you more.

29
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.560
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

30
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.229
Whoever the fuck you are. you
better get out here right now.

31
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.898
Shauna? What are you doing here?

32
00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.025
What are you doing alive?

33
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.694
My wife ruined our dinner.
my business didn't.

34
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.529
Now. my wife's a
fucking crazy person.

35
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.698
I'm not her. Don't
give up on me. guys.

36
00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.284
I think you came here because
you want your life to explode.

37
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.952
Fuck!

38
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.835
- Eat it.
- What the fuck?

Where's Taissa?

41
00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.409
Hey.

42
00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.954
You're awake.

43
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.503
Relax. Tai's still here.

44
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.339
Misty. too.

45
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.385
Shauna straight-up ditched you.

46
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:21.181
but... that figures. doesn't it?

47
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.892
What is this?

48
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:28.982
Is this a dream?

49
00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.319
Am I dead?

50
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.657
Death... is around every corner.

51
00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.659
All right. what do you want?

52
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.036
There's something
I need to ask you.

53
00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.830
Something really important.

54
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.878
Do you remember... <i>The Goonies?</i>

55
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.921
Are you fucking serious?

56
00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:57.593
Oh. my God. it's one of the
greatest quests of all time.

57
00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.971
Mikey. he finds out that
he's about to lose his house.

58
00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.015
but then him and his friends.

59
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.768
they find this old pirate map

60
00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.897
and they go on an
adventure to find...

61
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:13.358
The treasure. yes. I know. I
have seen this fucking movie.

62
00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.861
like. a hundred times
more than you. literally.

63
00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.738
Why are you telling me this?

64
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.243
Because it is a
classic hero's journey.

65
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.164
"X" marks the spot.

66
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.249
Taissa's been
trying to show you.

67
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.835
Listen to her.

68
00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.088
Yeah. she hasn't exactly
been herself lately.

69
00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.757
I know.

70
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.135
Even more reason.

71
00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.348
She needs this. too.

72
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.770
Hey. wh... whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
what is that?

73
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.775
It's just a little
something for the road.

74
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.861
Where am I going?

75
00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.198
<i>To
get the treasure.</i>

76
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.250
Hey. How you feeling?

77
00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:18.466
Like I've
been puking up blood.

78
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.593
What'd I miss?

79
00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.183
Hey. Aw.

80
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.768
Tai...

81
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.646
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

82
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.065
- Yeah.
- Come on.

83
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.526
You remember that time...

84
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.570
we were down at the shore

85
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.115
and there was that old
guy there and he was...

86
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.952
absolutely housing that
box of saltwater taffy?

87
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.205
And his nurse said
that was. like.

88
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.833
the only thing he wanted
to do before he died.

89
00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.334
As soon as we get home.
I am gonna get you

90
00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:56.003
the best fucking taffy there is.

91
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.380
Anything you want.

92
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.216
We're not going home.

93
00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.759
Baby. we can't stay here.

94
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.304
I know.

95
00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.684
But I don't like taffy.

96
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.397
Come on. Tai.

97
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.650
Goonies never say die.

98
00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.531
Go on. Just take a bite.

99
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.533
You're sick.

100
00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:29.036
Do you know who's
really gonna be sick?

101
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.038
Your family.

102
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.831
when they find out
that Mommy's name

103
00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.167
isn't actually
Kelly because. oops.

104
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.670
once upon a time she
killed and ate people.

105
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.548
How can you do this?

106
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.217
It should be obvious by now.

107
00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:46.262
Eat it.

108
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.468
Melissa!

109
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.189
Open the fucking door!

You don't get to tell
everyone what to do. Shauna.

133
00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:30.258
Yeah. well. I already did.

134
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:33.679
And they're gonna do it. so...

135
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.186
What is even
happening right now?

136
00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:46.066
You're all gonna see this
is the right decision.

137
00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.567
We've literally been in hell.

138
00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:49.653
You have no fucking
right to keep us in it.

139
00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.030
It's not me. It's what It wants.

140
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.450
No one is saying we have
to stay here forever.

141
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:57.327
But leaving right now

142
00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.496
when there are so many
things left to clean up?

143
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.040
It's not the smart move either.

144
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:05.085
Well. it sounds like you
guys all have a lot to discuss.

145
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.629
so have fun braiding
each other's hair and...

146
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.048
partaking in some
light cannibalism.

147
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.467
I'm fucking out of here.

148
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:14.804
That's not happening.

149
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.812
You sure this is the
move you want to make?

150
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.647
Don't do anything
stupid. Shauna.

151
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.942
Tell him that.

152
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.529
You sure you even know how
to use that. little girl?

153
00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.785
Don't worry. My
boyfriend taught me.

154
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.291
Shauna.

155
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.418
Shauna. we can put
them in the animal pen

156
00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.421
until we decide what to do.

157
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.593
Fine.

158
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.845
Take their shoes.

159
00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.807
Let's move.

160
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.101
Come on.

161
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.442
Hey. Hey.

162
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:13.445
Did you mean that?

163
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.239
About leaving eventually?

164
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.992
Those frog scientists
lost their shit

165
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.286
when they saw Coach.

166
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.455
Imagine what'll happen when the
rest of the world gets here.

167
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.040
Van. what's the point

168
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.666
of going back if it
means ruining our lives?

169
00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:29.669
I understand that the mind...

170
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.505
forgets things to protect itself

171
00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:34.299
or whatever. but

172
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.551
could you please

173
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:39.179
try and remember
what winter was like?

174
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.473
We survived.

175
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.643
We ate a fucking kid.

176
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.228
- We're prepared this time.
- We're not.

177
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.023
That game

178
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.526
will run out eventually.

179
00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:57.530
And you and I both
know what comes next.

180
00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:00.493
Good thing you've been
practicing with the cards.

181
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.536
Trust me. okay?

182
00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:05.497
I'm going to see
us through this.

183
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.500
We just have to be smart.

184
00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.972
How did the guy from the car
place get this to connect.

185
00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.808
and I can't?

186
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.851
We're 20 minutes from
the daughter's house. about

187
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.187
40 minutes from
Colonial Williamsburg.

188
00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:32.065
if anyone feels like churning
butter after we find Shauna.

189
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:35.193
And. uh. let's face it. we're
probably gonna need an alibi.

190
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.070
Mm. yeah. well. we don't
know what Shauna's done yet.

191
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.238
Oh. right.

192
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.573
I'm sure it's reasonable.

193
00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:42.534
All the more reason
to get there ASAP.

194
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.622
But we can make a pit
stop if you need one. huh?

195
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:49.208
Nah. I'm good.

196
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.046
Oh. Jesus.

197
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.756
I can't believe
someone's actually

198
00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:58.758
having a worse day than I am.

199
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.885
Wait. Wait!

200
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.554
- That looks like...
- Oh!

201
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.597
- Fuck!
- Stop the car!

202
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.228
Melissa?

203
00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.231
- I think Misty's right.
- What?

204
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.901
Oh. shit.

205
00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.194
Melissa! Melissa!

206
00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.404
Go back!

207
00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.114
- Go. go. go now!
- Uh...

208
00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.578
- She's getting away.
- Okay.

209
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.080
I got her. I got her.

210
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.582
What is she doing?

211
00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.017
No. you don't.

212
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.312
I got you now this time!

213
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.815
Hey.

214
00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:57.525
I don't know how
you're still alive.

215
00:12:57.526 --> 00:12:58.943
but you won't be much longer
if you don't cooperate.

216
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.618
"X" marks the spot.

217
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.965
So...

218
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.135
...how you been?

219
00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.345
Jesus Christ.

220
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:26.596
What the fuck is going on?

221
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:27.680
You're dead.

222
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.933
What's going on is that

223
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.976
Shauna's gone off
the fucking deep end.

224
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.270
She broke into my
house. attacked me...

225
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:35.271
Did you send that tape?

226
00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.606
Yes.

227
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.274
But there's a lot more to it.

228
00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:39.818
More than you sending literal

229
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.861
evidence of murder?

230
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:43.655
How did you think
Shauna was gonna react?

231
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.990
Hello? Do you
know why I'm bleeding?

232
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.035
She made me eat my fucking arm!

233
00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:52.872
Okay.

234
00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:54.374
- We got to find her.
- Yeah.

235
00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:56.376
Well... well. then
let me out because

236
00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:57.335
- I am not going back.
- Nope.

237
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.920
Sit down.

238
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.213
Don't do this.

239
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:01.256
She's out of her mind.

240
00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.674
Just shut up.

241
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.551
Or you really will be dead.

242
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.888
She's completely
out of control.

243
00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.602
Shh...

244
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.623
<i>They're
up to something.</i>

245
00:15:58.624 --> 00:15:59.666
Who?

246
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:00.708
The others.

247
00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:01.752
Like what?

248
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.254
If I knew that. I would
have handled it already.

249
00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:07.423
Okay. well.
we have the gun.

250
00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:09.759
They'd be dumb to try
anything without it.

251
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.886
Well. everyone knows you guys
kick me out of the meetings

252
00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.179
because you think I'm annoying.

253
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.183
But. I mean. what
if we... use that?

254
00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:18.935
Like. get some intel from it?

255
00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:21.521
- Okay. Double-0-Quigley.
- No. that's...

256
00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.606
that's actually a good idea.

257
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.319
Do it.

258
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.631
- Shauna?
- Oh. God.

259
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:50.174
In here.

260
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.719
Yeah. okay. I-I might

261
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.221
have made things a-a
little bit worse.

262
00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:57.265
Um...

263
00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.725
Oh. thank God.

264
00:16:58.726 --> 00:16:59.892
But. wait.

265
00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:01.644
How did you find her?

266
00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.855
- She ran out of gas.
- Oh.

267
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.732
I guess you should have
listened to your wife.

268
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:08.901
Okay. what are we going to use

269
00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:10.319
to tie her up with?

270
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.988
Hang on.

271
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.698
Can we just take a minute here?

272
00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.074
Why?

273
00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.534
She admitted that
she sent the tape.

274
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.244
Which means she killed Lottie.

275
00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:20.288
Not so fast. Martha Misdirect.

276
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:23.291
Let's not forget
that Shauna's DNA

277
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.376
was under Lottie's fingernails.

278
00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.879
And she was in the city

279
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.922
- the day Lottie died.
- Wait. what?

280
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.799
Oh. yeah. I...

281
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.385
I literally have the receipt.

282
00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.680
Well. that doesn't look good.

283
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.349
Shauna. what were
you doing there?

284
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.894
I was getting a cat.

285
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.854
Wow.

286
00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.564
What a totally
satisfying answer.

287
00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.941
Uh. care to elaborate?

288
00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:50.610
Yeah. I...

289
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.445
went to the Humane Society

290
00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.447
because I saw on their website

291
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.574
that they happened
to have this cat

292
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.868
that was exactly the same

293
00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.370
as this other cat that
Jeff was trying to find.

294
00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.122
Uh. for his karma.

295
00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:05.166
So...

296
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.003
And you expect us
to believe this...

297
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:10.463
...tale of two cats?

298
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:11.798
- Oh. God.
- You know what?

299
00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.300
I don't give a shit
what you believe.

300
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:16.761
You've made that
abundantly clear.

301
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.138
She's trying to
pin this on Melissa

302
00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:21.891
to cover up the fact that she's
the one that killed Lottie.

303
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.434
Melissa sent the tape.

304
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.853
So she's the one
who left the phone.

305
00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:27.230
And cut my brakes.

306
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.773
And locked me in the freezer.

307
00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.400
Oh. for the love of
God. the freezer was me.

308
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:32.735
What?

309
00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:34.362
The lock's been
broken for months.

310
00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.738
I would have warned you.

311
00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:37.240
but you've been such
an absolute asshole

312
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.908
that I thought a little
time in the freezer

313
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.701
would do you some good.

314
00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:41.869
Okay. you guys feeling better?

315
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.121
Because we need to focus.

316
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.831
We are where we are.

317
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:47.291
So you're just gonna go
ahead and take her side?

318
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.127
Of course she is.

319
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.920
It's not about sides.

320
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.172
I just don't think
Shauna killed Lottie.

321
00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:54.549
- Thank you.
- And right now

322
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.842
I think we need to figure out

323
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:57.135
what we're gonna do to mitigate

324
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.637
this situation.

325
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.516
No. No.

326
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.476
This is Shauna's mess.

327
00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.895
You can find some other
maid to clean it up.

328
00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.900
But don't think for a second

329
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:15.404
I won't get to the
bottom of all this.

330
00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:26.539
Can I. uh. talk to you?

331
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.250
- Sure.
- I was just out in the woods.

332
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.128
and I-I don't know. I...

333
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:35.631
I felt this rush
through my body.

334
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:39.343
I've never felt that before
when I wasn't tripping. but I...

335
00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.512
I think It...

336
00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.264
was trying to talk to me.

337
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.683
- Hmm.
- Will you come with me?

338
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.518
See if I'm right?

339
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.145
Yeah. of course.

340
00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.155
This is so insane.

341
00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.865
Who the fuck do
they think they are?

342
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.158
We just have to wait.

343
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.159
Until when?

344
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.244
The next blizzard?

345
00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:07.163
We've been waiting
here for over a year.

346
00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:09.415
I cannot go through
another winter out here.

347
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:12.628
If we are here. I hope the
Wilderness chooses me first.

348
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.589
'Cause I don't think I
can handle that again.

349
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.508
Home was right there.

350
00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:21.344
Cheeseburgers...

351
00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:23.137
- We could steal the gun back.
- Mm.

352
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.097
Shauna hasn't let
it leave her sight.

353
00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:27.934
But you don't think that
she'd actually use it. do you?

354
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.519
No way. She's too chickenshit.

355
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.481
Is she?

356
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:42.157
I think there's another way.

357
00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:49.080
<i>♪ You're so fucking pretty... ♪</i>

358
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.790
Oh. hells yeah.

359
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.625
Hell yes!

360
00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:55.503
Dad?

361
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.422
Honey. you are not gonna...

362
00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:00.174
Is that weed?

363
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.634

364
00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:04.929
Callie Sadecki. are
you rolling a joint?

365
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.432
I can't find my pipe.

366
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:12.478
Don't look so shocked. I
know that Mom steals my weed.

367
00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:14.730
Why were you yelling?

368
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:19.485
Uh. the Joels just offered
me that furniture job.

369
00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:21.612
That's great. Dad. Mm.

370
00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.615
Really. Congrats.

371
00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:28.870

372
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.664

374
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.710
Yeah. those nugs are too big.

375
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.003
You'll never get an even smoke

376
00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:39.381
unless you grind
those up some more.

377
00:21:56.523 --> 00:21:58.774
You sure you're good here?

378
00:21:58.775 --> 00:22:00.651
Yeah. Thanks. Dave.

379
00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:03.904
I'll be sure to check out your
aquarium ornaments on Etsy.

380
00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:39.441
I'm so glad you texted!

381
00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.069
What do you think?

382
00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:44.403
It's excessive!

383
00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:46.113
I know. right?

384
00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:48.617
Uh. part of me was afraid
you'd think it was excessive.

385
00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:51.285
It's not mine. though.

386
00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:53.413
Keith Morrison owed me a favor.

387
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:56.166
Hey. let's go!

388
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:24.735
We have dinner covered. Misty.

389
00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.738
Well. we'll need
nourishment later.

390
00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:29.157
So we're prepared.

391
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.785
Prepared for what?

392
00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:34.955
You know.

393
00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:39.166
We don't. actually.

394
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:40.626
Oh.

395
00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:44.338
I just thought you guys
were a part of. uh...

396
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:46.173
the plan.

397
00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:49.135
We saw you in that
meeting with Team Crazy.

398
00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:50.804
Quit embarrassing yourself.

399
00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.765
Fine.

400
00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.977
If you guys don't want
to get out of here.

401
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:02.983
But if you change your
mind... come find me.

402
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.156
Wait. does she know something?

403
00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:11.783
No.

404
00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:14.077
No.

405
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:33.322
- Happy now?
- Is it tight?

406
00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:34.573
Yes.

407
00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:36.367
So. what's next?
Her family's gonna

408
00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:38.160
come home at some point.

409
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:40.663
and we still have a big
fucking problem to solve.

410
00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:42.665
I am not the problem.

411
00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.500
Shauna is the problem.

412
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.418
You both know it
as well as I do.

413
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.921
Not entirely inaccurate.

414
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:50.756
Come on.

415
00:25:50.757 --> 00:25:52.508
- This is kind of like Adam.
- Except there's no body

416
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:53.425
- yet.
- Yeah.

417
00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:54.760
- Mm.
- Who's Adam?

418
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:56.805
Why did you say that?

419
00:25:57.806 --> 00:25:59.306
This
happened before?

420
00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:02.101
And... there was a body?

421
00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:04.270
You just dug her grave.
You know that. right?

422
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:07.356
All we're saying is.
this feels familiar.

423
00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:11.527
So. Shauna acted like a lunatic

424
00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:13.654
and killed this Adam.

425
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.239
made you guys clean it up.

426
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.784
So... she put you at risk and.

427
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:21.454
let me guess. she
was wrong then. too?

428
00:26:22.455 --> 00:26:23.790
He...

429
00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:27.126
Her family doesn't even
know her real name.

430
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.878
What kind of psychopath

431
00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:32.047
brings home a dead woman's tape

432
00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:34.008
and then marries her daughter?

433
00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:37.012
Holy shit. You
married Hannah's kid?

434
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.472
Yes. Okay. but...

435
00:26:40.473 --> 00:26:43.017
You know what? Actually...

436
00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:45.770
I think it's time for you
to just shut the fuck up.

437
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.980
- You don't understand...
- N-Nope.

438
00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:49.107
And you need to sit down.

439
00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:54.111
So what do we do here?

440
00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:56.822
I mean. there's not
exactly a ton of options.

441
00:26:56.823 --> 00:26:57.906
Are you okay?

442
00:26:57.907 --> 00:26:59.408
Yeah.

443
00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:01.535
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

444
00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:04.121
Just going to the car.

445
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:05.164
Shauna.

446
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:06.957
Let me think.

447
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.584
Oh. God. yeah. maybe
you should have done that

448
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.794
before you turned
her arm into sashimi.

449
00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:14.924
How about "B"?

450
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.136
Damn.

451
00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:22.598
Sorry.

452
00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.643
This game sucks.

453
00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:28.021
Want me to turn on the TV?

454
00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:30.939
Stop.

455
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.067
I would literally get shot again

456
00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:34.985
just to watch <i>The Real World.</i>

457
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.695
Wait. where is it this season?

458
00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:37.696
No clue.

459
00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:41.325
Only because it's
mostly Nickelodeon on

460
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.369
at home these days.

461
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.622
I have a daughter.

462
00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:47.956
She's ten.

463
00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:49.668
Oh. shit.

464
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.628
Really?

465
00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:55.255
I'm sorry. I... I
just really miss her.

466
00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:57.091
Uh. don't be sorry. I...

467
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:58.384
I get it.

468
00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.802
I know you do.

469
00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.638
I know you all do.

470
00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:05.766
You've been missing your
families for over a year.

471
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:07.185
Yeah.

472
00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:10.187
But...

473
00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.190
this is fucked.

474
00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:19.154
They can't keep us as
prisoners forever. right?

475
00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:20.948
I stopped trying to predict
what's going to happen

476
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:22.867
out here a long time ago.

477
00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:26.412
All I know is. people
are willing to do

478
00:28:26.413 --> 00:28:28.915
some messed-up stuff
just to see another day.

479
00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:36.630
Honestly?

480
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:39.425
From a purely
scientific perspective.

481
00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:42.511
this is the most fascinating
study of survival

482
00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:44.096
I've ever witnessed.

483
00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:46.432
Even more so than horny frogs.

484
00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:51.562
Probably because teenage
girls are even hornier.

485
00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:54.399
Am I
interrupting something?

486
00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:06.076
Shauna. wait.

487
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.082
What's your deal?

488
00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.876
What were you two
giggling about?

489
00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:16.378
Nothing.

490
00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:18.672
Stupid stuff. Why?

491
00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:22.551
Don't you know how dumb
it is to get close to her?

492
00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:25.053
She's just using you
to try to escape.

493
00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:26.472
And what?

494
00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:28.599
You think
she makes a joke

495
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.809
and I'm like. "You're
hilarious. here's your freedom"?

496
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.269
What'd she say to you?

497
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.980
Nothing... just...

498
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:37.274
She has a kid... back home.

499
00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:40.987
And you believe that?

500
00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.572
Why wouldn't I?

501
00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:45.240
She just wants you
to feel bad for her.

502
00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:46.283
She's manipulating you.

503
00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.743
I don't think that she is.

504
00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:49.661
And. yeah. I do
feel kind of bad.

505
00:29:49.662 --> 00:29:51.413
She must really miss her.

506
00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:53.916
Well. I'm glad you
have so much sympathy for her.

507
00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.793
This isn't a
competition. Shauna.

508
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.128
I know. I just...

509
00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:00.965
well. I didn't think you
were this fucking stupid.

510
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.514
Hey. Melissa!

511
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:10.599
- I'm not done talking to you!
- See how much I care?

512
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.975
You think you're important?

513
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:14.521
No one gave a shit
about you until me!

514
00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:28.117
Why can't you just
be a nice person?

515
00:30:32.455 --> 00:30:34.165
You're nothing.

516
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.502
Jesus.

517
00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:45.676
You guys were right.

518
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.804
She's fucking nuts.

519
00:30:48.763 --> 00:30:50.014
Wh-Wh-Whoa. whoa. whoa.

520
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.102
Say that again?

521
00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:01.817
Come on. Shauna.

522
00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:03.444
Put the gun down.

523
00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:11.035
I fucking dare you.

524
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.220
Oh. God.

525
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:41.773
Let's go. Go.

526
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:51.408
Travis. what's wrong?

527
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:54.913
Nothing.

528
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.629
Tell me. I can help.

529
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:08.300
Help me? No.

530
00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:09.802
Lottie. you can't.

531
00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.971
It's bullshit.

532
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:14.932
You're bullshit.

533
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:18.226
We have a chance at rescue.
Do you not get that?

534
00:32:18.227 --> 00:32:20.979
We can go home. and
you're ruining it.

535
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.651
You're ruining
everything for all of us.

536
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:28.487
I can't. I can't
let you do this.

537
00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:30.322
I can't. I can't.

538
00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:32.200
- I'm sorry. Travis.
- I won't.

539
00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:38.997
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:42.168
I just wanted you to
see that he's here.

541
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:45.838
That Javi's with us.

542
