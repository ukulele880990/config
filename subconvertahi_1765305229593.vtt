3
00:00:42.444 --> 00:00:46.573
Nowadays. the US
government can listen to anything you say.

4
00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:49.993
They know where you are.
they know who you're talking to.

5
00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:53.455
and trust me.
they know who you're fucking.

6
00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.292
You turn on a cell phone or a computer.
and you're doomed.

7
00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:02.506
But in Colombia in 1989.
it wasn't that easy.

8
00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.800
First off.
there was no Internet.

9
00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:06.301
No cells.

10
00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:08.053
The best they had were satellite phones.

11
00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:12.391
and in order to capture a satellite phone.
you had to fly directly over it.

12
00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:16.770
On top of that. the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

13
00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.231
the landowners. the politicians...

14
00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:24.319
And lucky for us.
the narcos were richer than them all.

15
00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.075
What's up. Lizard?

16
00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:33.453
We're going out tonight.

17
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.794
And once you got a signal.
you didn't know who you were listening to.

18
00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:44.464
That's why back then. the US government
developed software that could identify

19
00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:47.008
the voices of our targets.

20
00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:51.221
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz.
gentlemen.

21
00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:54.349
No GPS either.

22
00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.810
Hammer. prepare to engage.

23
00:01:57.018 --> 00:02:00.313
Once we got a target.
we still had to locate it.

24
00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:04.150
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

25
00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:09.907
OK. he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

26
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.158
Hawkeye. how do you copy that?

27
00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:15.788
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

28
00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:18.039
La Dispensaria.

29
00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.709
I've got a table ready.

30
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.337
Show up around midnight.

31
00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:27.466
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it.

32
00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.760
but he'd just made himself a date.

33
00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:33.764
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

34
00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:35.724
Hammer. disengage.

35
00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:38.101
So who do we give this to? DEA?

36
00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:41.688
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Pe�a.
- Pe�a's an asshole.

37
00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:43.857
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

38
00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:48.320
By "the other guy." he meant me.

39
00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.573
I'm Steve Murphy.
Drug Enforcement Agent.

40
00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:56.202
And as you can see.
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

41
00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:57.329
Hello?

42
00:02:57.412 --> 00:02:59.873
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

43
00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:00.791
Got it.

44
00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:03.502
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

45
00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:04.920
OK.

46
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:07.589
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself.

47
00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:11.010
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

48
00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:15.096
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

49
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.348
Hola.

50
00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:20.101
La Dispensaria?

51
00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:21.227
All right.

52
00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:25.231
Guess who that was.

53
00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:27.567
Your partner.

54
00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:30.362
He just gave me a great gift.

55
00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:32.823
Poison.

56
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.913
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

57
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.165
Yeah. sure.

58
00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.376
He's not a fool.

59
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.670
Gotta go.

60
00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:50.757
Gonna stick me with the bill?

61
00:03:54.678 --> 00:03:57.305
Cheap son of a bitch.

62
00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.017
In case you're wondering.
this is the asshole.

63
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.978
Javier Pe�a. my partner.

64
00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:06.565
And this is Colonel Carrillo.
the leader of the Search Bloc.

65
00:04:06.648 --> 00:04:09.609
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

66
00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:12.487
Boy. did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

67
00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:20.286
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

68
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.205
Especially the local hitmen.

69
00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.041
Colombians call them sicarios.

70
00:04:24.124 --> 00:04:26.877
- What's up. son?
- Hey. brother.

71
00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:30.380
Let's go inside and have a good time.

72
00:04:30.463 --> 00:04:32.465
Now. Poison. he was one of the best.

73
00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:36.469
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

74
00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:38.013
Probably hundreds.

75
00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:39.890
But don't get me wrong.

76
00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:43.226
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

77
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:46.813
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

78
00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.280
It's on. boys!

79
00:04:55.363 --> 00:04:58.617
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

80
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.745
Riano. Trujillo.
you're in the front with me.

81
00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:04.039
- Galvis and Silva. you take up the rear.
- Yes. sir.

82
00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:06.625
You got it. boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

83
00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:09.502
We're gonna kill these fuckers.
all right?

84
00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.004
Yes. sir!

85
00:05:22.724 --> 00:05:26.103
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

86
00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:33.526
Yeah. I pushed the buttons.

87
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.041
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

88
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.217
My fellow Americans...

89
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.635
Take Richard Nixon. for instance.

90
00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:26.806
People forget.
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

91
00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:29.809
We thought he was one of the good guys.

92
00:07:30.018 --> 00:07:33.105
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

93
00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:34.898
because he hated the commies.

94
00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:37.567
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

95
00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:45.784
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

96
00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:51.539
Maybe not such a good guy after all.

97
00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:01.091
But sometimes.
bad guys do good things.

98
00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:07.555
Nobody knows this. but back in '73.
Chile was on its way

99
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:11.559
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

100
00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:16.522
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

101
00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:20.152
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

102
00:08:20.235 --> 00:08:21.361
to ship the product north.

103
00:08:21.444 --> 00:08:25.115
To be productive.
you can't waste money! Come on!

104
00:08:26.491 --> 00:08:28.201
You're surrounded!

105
00:08:28.285 --> 00:08:30.703
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

106
00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:32.331
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

107
00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.291
What the fuck is going on here?

108
00:08:34.374 --> 00:08:35.375
On the ground!

109
00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:39.712
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

110
00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:45.844
And then. being Pinochet...

111
00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:48.930
he had them all killed.

112
00:08:49.014 --> 00:08:51.641
Attention!

113
00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:54.269
Weapons ready!

114
00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:55.770
Aim!

115
00:08:56.771 --> 00:08:57.772
Ready ammunition!

116
00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:00.733
Fire!

117
00:09:10.118 --> 00:09:13.746
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world.

118
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.750
only the cockroaches will survive.

119
00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.544
I guess they were right.

120
00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:26.801
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno.
aka Cockroach.

121
00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:29.137
and he was smart enough to play dead.

122
00:09:32.682 --> 00:09:34.351
He wasn't killed on that day.

123
00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:39.772
Instead. he won the damn lottery.

124
00:09:43.109 --> 00:09:46.863
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

125
00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:50.283
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

126
00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:53.870
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

127
00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:57.332
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

128
00:09:57.416 --> 00:10:00.293
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

129
00:10:01.378 --> 00:10:05.840
- But you're not a communist.
- No. not a communist. something worse.

130
00:10:05.924 --> 00:10:08.260
A drug trafficker.

131
00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:11.596
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes. a drug trafficker.

132
00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:18.103
Back then. we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

133
00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:21.022
on the human brain.

134
00:10:21.106 --> 00:10:24.359
We didn't know much. but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

135
00:10:24.567 --> 00:10:26.778
This will give us better results. OK?

136
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:30.073
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

137
00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:33.368
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

138
00:10:33.452 --> 00:10:39.291
It would choose cocaine over sleep.
over sex... over life itself.

139
00:10:39.374 --> 00:10:42.502
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

140
00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:46.756
unless we're talking about cocaine.

141
00:10:53.054 --> 00:10:55.223
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

142
00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:58.559
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

143
00:10:58.643 --> 00:11:00.019
Gracias.

144
00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:04.774
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

145
00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:05.984
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

146
00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:12.198
Like Goldilocks.
he had three options.

147
00:11:12.282 --> 00:11:15.535
And pay attention. because all three
are important to this story.

148
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.418
Jorge. that's Fabio on the horse.

149
00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:27.213
A typical Colombian smuggling family.

150
00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:29.715
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

151
00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:32.969
But Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

152
00:11:34.012 --> 00:11:37.807
Another possible partner
was Jos� Rodr�guez Gacha.

153
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.686
nicknamed "The Mexican."
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

154
00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:44.564
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

155
00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:55.033
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade.
even by Colombian standards.

156
00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:56.617
If you make it to the top...

157
00:11:58.077 --> 00:12:01.080
it means you've killed your enemies.

158
00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:05.210
Hey. partner. What are you doing here?

159
00:12:05.418 --> 00:12:07.045
And sometimes. your partners.

160
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.887
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

161
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:24.521
A man Cockroach knew would be just right.

162
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.611
Yeah. you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

163
00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:34.030
The man who would
change my life forever.

164
00:12:35.948 --> 00:12:39.244
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

165
00:12:39.327 --> 00:12:41.787
Cigarettes. alcohol. marijuana.
you name it.

166
00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:46.667
At the time.
Pablo owned half the police in Medell�n.

167
00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:51.256
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

168
00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:54.551
They didn't play by the same rules.

169
00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:57.429
Good day.

170
00:12:58.179 --> 00:12:59.472
Pablo Escobar?

171
00:12:59.556 --> 00:13:00.973
Where's Felipo?

172
00:13:01.182 --> 00:13:03.101
Felipo's been arrested.

173
00:13:03.184 --> 00:13:04.977
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

174
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:08.064
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

175
00:13:08.147 --> 00:13:10.567
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

176
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.777
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax. Gustavo. please.

177
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.446
Show some respect.

178
00:13:16.615 --> 00:13:18.866
Now what's the problem.
Mr. Jose Luis?

179
00:13:21.327 --> 00:13:22.954
How do you know my name?

180
00:13:23.162 --> 00:13:25.206
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

181
00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:29.919
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

182
00:13:32.964 --> 00:13:36.968
There's Garcia. Lopez...

183
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:39.095
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes. Pinilla.

184
00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:40.305
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

185
00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:41.889
Pinilla...

186
00:13:41.973 --> 00:13:43.808
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

187
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:45.977
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

188
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.604
I don't have all day.

189
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:53.401
Open it.

190
00:14:02.827 --> 00:14:04.454
Tell me something. Mr. Escobar.

191
00:14:05.538 --> 00:14:07.248
Who the fuck do you think you are?

192
00:14:07.332 --> 00:14:10.751
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

193
00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:12.629
Because I pay for the privilege. Colonel.

194
00:14:12.712 --> 00:14:14.422
Oh. yeah? You don't say.

195
00:14:14.506 --> 00:14:16.299
Where are your import papers?

196
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.636
You need papers for these TV sets.

197
00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:21.137
Take them.

198
00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:27.935
Sorry. Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medell�n police making a shit salary.

199
00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:30.355
- Look. brother. it's not for you.
- Then who?

200
00:14:30.438 --> 00:14:32.231
It's for Carlitos.

201
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.275
Your son.

202
00:14:36.444 --> 00:14:39.155
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

203
00:14:41.324 --> 00:14:42.659
Hey. Pinilla!

204
00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:48.039
Your daughter just
got her driver's license. right?

205
00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:54.045
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

206
00:14:55.171 --> 00:14:59.342
That friend of yours. Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

207
00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:02.845
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

208
00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:04.723
Your wife is gorgeous. brother.

209
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.684
What's she doing with a guy like you?

210
00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:16.526
I think she deserves some jewelry. no?

211
00:15:18.737 --> 00:15:21.740
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

212
00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:28.329
Colonel. how is your mom doing?

213
00:15:28.413 --> 00:15:31.583
- She just got out of the hospital. right?
- Yes. she's feeling better.

214
00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.835
- Good. That makes us happy. right?
- Yes.

215
00:15:36.087 --> 00:15:37.380
Gentlemen...

216
00:15:38.464 --> 00:15:40.633
I'm going to tell you who I am.

217
00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:45.012
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

218
00:15:46.097 --> 00:15:48.391
My eyes are everywhere.

219
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.437
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

220
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.605
without me knowing about it.

221
00:15:53.854 --> 00:15:56.775
Do you understand? Not a finger.

222
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:03.615
One day. I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

223
00:16:04.616 --> 00:16:08.745
So look. I make deals for a living.

224
00:16:08.828 --> 00:16:12.373
Now. you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

225
00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:15.710
or accept the consequences.

226
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.715
Silver...

227
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.926
or lead.

228
00:16:25.428 --> 00:16:26.971
You decide.

229
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.561
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right. then.

230
00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:21.233
Yo. Pablo!

231
00:17:21.984 --> 00:17:23.695
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

232
00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:25.738
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

233
00:17:25.822 --> 00:17:28.324
No. no. no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

234
00:17:28.407 --> 00:17:30.326
All right.
yesterday we were talking.

235
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:34.873
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

236
00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:36.332
Explain.

237
00:17:36.415 --> 00:17:39.460
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

238
00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:41.587
I will handle
the chemical part of production.

239
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:44.173
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

240
00:17:44.256 --> 00:17:46.676
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

241
00:17:46.885 --> 00:17:50.137
Now tell him how much it costs.

242
00:17:50.346 --> 00:17:54.183
In Chile. this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

243
00:17:54.392 --> 00:17:58.020
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes. it's very good. Look...

244
00:17:58.103 --> 00:18:03.317
You do a little bit. and in 20 minutes.
you want to do some more.

245
00:18:03.526 --> 00:18:04.903
Also...

246
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.322
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

247
00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:10.950
It's very clean. this stuff.
Want some?

248
00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:14.662
If this is really that good
and we can make some money.

249
00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:16.664
we can find room on our trucks.

250
00:18:16.748 --> 00:18:19.208
We can sell it in Bogot�. Barranquilla.
Cali. Cartagena...

251
00:18:19.417 --> 00:18:21.669
We're going to be rich.

252
00:18:21.753 --> 00:18:24.505
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

253
00:18:26.298 --> 00:18:27.967
Well look. Cuca...

254
00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:30.970
you don't have any vision.
my friend.

255
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:35.975
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

256
00:18:37.017 --> 00:18:40.229
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

257
00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:45.818
I love that song.

258
00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:50.573
Rodrigo! One more.

259
00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:16.432
Back then. Miami was a paradise.

260
00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:19.393
I signed up for the sand.
surf and women.

261
00:19:21.103 --> 00:19:24.315
In '79. the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

262
00:19:24.398 --> 00:19:25.566
DEA! Stop!

263
00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:29.779
I was a young DEA agent.
partnered with my buddy. Kevin Brady.

264
00:19:30.989 --> 00:19:33.032
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

265
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.578
Why you running. huh?

266
00:19:37.787 --> 00:19:40.665
What you got? What is this? Huh?

267
00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:41.666
What is that?

268
00:19:41.749 --> 00:19:44.877
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

269
00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:47.046
Let's go celebrate.

270
00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:48.714
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

271
00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:53.678
Go! Go! Go!

272
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:56.221
How you like me now?

273
00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:57.473
How much money you owe me?

274
00:19:57.682 --> 00:19:59.308
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

275
00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:01.019
That's right. that's right.

276
00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:06.607
All right.
All right. who do we pick?

277
00:20:06.816 --> 00:20:08.317
How 'bout her?

278
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.819
No. no. no.
we gotta fuck with him.

279
00:20:09.902 --> 00:20:11.904
- Yeah. let's mess with his head.
- Um...

280
00:20:11.988 --> 00:20:13.823
Oh. right there.
See her? At the bar?

281
00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:16.034
- Which one?
- Blue top. blond hair. That's his type.

282
00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:19.203
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

283
00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:20.579
- All right.
- Whoo!

284
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.790
Murph! Sparrow. three o'clock.

285
00:20:22.874 --> 00:20:26.711
Hey. while you were walking back.
she was checking your ass out.

286
00:20:26.794 --> 00:20:28.337
Oh. she was checking out your ass.

287
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.839
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

288
00:20:29.922 --> 00:20:33.801
Listen. she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

289
00:20:33.885 --> 00:20:36.554
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

290
00:20:36.762 --> 00:20:40.182
I'm serious. I'm serious. Look at her.

291
00:20:40.391 --> 00:20:42.977
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

292
00:20:43.061 --> 00:20:44.603
No. the other one.
Of course the blond one.

293
00:20:44.687 --> 00:20:46.397
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

294
00:20:47.147 --> 00:20:50.442
You dicking me around?

295
00:20:53.404 --> 00:20:54.780
Fuck it. I'm going in.

296
00:20:54.864 --> 00:20:56.032
- Go get her.
- Mm!

297
00:20:56.115 --> 00:20:57.909
- Yup.
- Hey. while you're up there.

298
00:20:57.992 --> 00:20:59.493

299
00:20:59.702 --> 00:21:02.705
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

300
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.216
How you doing?

301
00:21:15.051 --> 00:21:16.052
Busy.

302
00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:21.181
I just said. "Look. if you don't
wanna be there. you don't have to be."

303
00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:24.476
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So. I don't know...

304
00:21:27.897 --> 00:21:30.524
Yeah. those bastards got me.

305
00:21:30.608 --> 00:21:32.944
But I couldn't let it end like that.

306
00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:35.863
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

307
00:21:37.156 --> 00:21:38.449
Uh. they're fucking with me.

308
00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:41.994
Telling me you were checking out my ass.
and who checks out a cop's ass. right?

309
00:21:42.078 --> 00:21:43.328
You're a cop?

310
00:21:43.412 --> 00:21:45.748
Not a cop. actually. I'm DEA.

311
00:21:45.957 --> 00:21:46.999
Drug Enforcement?

312
00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:49.085
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

313
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.463
Come on. why don't you do me a favor?

314
00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:55.133
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you. uh...

315
00:21:55.215 --> 00:21:56.926
give me your phone number?

316
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.344
How about a fake number?

317
00:22:00.429 --> 00:22:01.430
That'll work.

318
00:22:02.264 --> 00:22:03.975
Hey. buddy. you got a pen?

319
00:22:18.656 --> 00:22:21.241
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

320
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.744
Have a good night.

321
00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:29.125
Aah...

322
00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:30.375
Shot down!

323
00:22:31.543 --> 00:22:34.213
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh. I...

324
00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:36.381
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

325
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.844
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

326
00:22:39.927 --> 00:22:42.387
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

327
00:22:42.471 --> 00:22:44.140
How much did that cost you?

328
00:22:44.223 --> 00:22:46.350
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

329
00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:55.442
I figured. what the hell.

330
00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:58.946
Worst that could happen.
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

331
00:23:05.327 --> 00:23:06.537
Hello?

332
00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:09.498
So it wasn't a fake.

333
00:23:09.707 --> 00:23:12.043
I thought you might figure it out.

334
00:23:12.126 --> 00:23:14.545
After all. you're DEA.

335
00:23:14.628 --> 00:23:18.007
And just like that... she had me.

336
00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:24.471
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru.

337
00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:26.348
cocaine had him.

338
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:30.769
It's been a while.

339
00:23:30.853 --> 00:23:33.438
These are my friends.
Pablo and Gustavo.

340
00:23:34.523 --> 00:23:36.942
Would you like a little coffee?

341
00:23:37.026 --> 00:23:38.652
Yeah. a coffee?

342
00:23:38.736 --> 00:23:39.737
Yes. a coffee.

343
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.905
- How about you. Pablo?
- No.

344
00:23:40.988 --> 00:23:42.531
You sure?

345
00:23:42.614 --> 00:23:46.744
My factory is small.
but highly productive.

346
00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:51.707
Look. For crushing the leaves. I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

347
00:23:53.876 --> 00:23:55.460
Little magic leaves.

348
00:23:56.378 --> 00:23:59.298
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

349
00:23:59.381 --> 00:24:05.345
Over here. the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

350
00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:10.517
Then you cut it.
and mix it with gasoline.

351
00:24:10.601 --> 00:24:14.605
Then. basically. you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

352
00:24:14.688 --> 00:24:16.523
Let it dry. dry. dry.

353
00:24:16.607 --> 00:24:18.358
You use ammonia to get the paste.

354
00:24:18.442 --> 00:24:23.989
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

355
00:24:24.073 --> 00:24:26.325
Here is the prize.

356
00:24:26.408 --> 00:24:28.827
It's like the kitchen in your house.

357
00:24:29.745 --> 00:24:32.915
Like baking a cake.

358
00:24:33.749 --> 00:24:36.919
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

359
00:24:39.088 --> 00:24:41.215
Look. an old press. an antique.

360
00:24:45.677 --> 00:24:48.806
Now we put it in the oven.

361
00:24:48.889 --> 00:24:51.516
Here's one.
The other will follow.

362
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.686
All natural. organic and healthy.
Very good.

363
00:24:55.562 --> 00:24:56.939
Well...

364
00:24:58.023 --> 00:25:01.485
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

365
00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:04.780
- No.
- You said a kilo.

366
00:25:04.863 --> 00:25:06.282
We'll take five.

367
00:25:06.365 --> 00:25:10.286
How do we get five across the border?

368
00:25:10.369 --> 00:25:12.246
That's Gustavo's department.

369
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.962
This one has got a good engine.

370
00:25:20.045 --> 00:25:22.673
I was taking a look at it.
and the best place to hide the merchandise

371
00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:24.967
would be under the rear wheel well.

372
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.178
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

373
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:28.595
Is this easy to take off?

374
00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:31.390
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

375
00:25:31.473 --> 00:25:33.851
All right. all right.
I'll take three cars. please.

376
00:25:33.934 --> 00:25:36.895
- Sure. when do you need them?
- Now. brother.

377
00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:40.565
All right. we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

378
00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:42.818
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

379
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:48.073
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

380
00:25:48.157 --> 00:25:50.368
For three cars. that's 60 kilos.

381
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.787
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram. what?

382
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:55.414
$9.000 per kilo.

383
00:25:55.497 --> 00:25:58.042
$9.000 times 60...
The profit is $540.000.

384
00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:00.336
That's it!

385
00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.254
- Do you know how to drive. Cockroach?
- Yeah.

386
00:26:02.338 --> 00:26:04.048
OK. Pablo and I drive fast.

387
00:26:04.256 --> 00:26:08.010
That's half a million dollars... per trip.

388
00:26:08.093 --> 00:26:11.222
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

389
00:26:14.016 --> 00:26:15.809
Easiest money he ever made.

390
00:26:21.148 --> 00:26:24.068
Back in Medell�n.
Pablo didn't waste any time.

391
00:26:24.151 --> 00:26:25.819
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

392
00:26:25.903 --> 00:26:30.949
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

393
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.785
How are you feeling. Gustavo?

394
00:26:35.413 --> 00:26:37.373
All this smells like shit to me.

395
00:26:37.456 --> 00:26:41.001
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

396
00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:43.421
The stinkier. the better.

397
00:26:44.088 --> 00:26:45.339
All right.

398
00:26:46.382 --> 00:26:48.175
What about all these lights?

399
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.263
Is that to tip off the cops.
or what?

400
00:26:52.346 --> 00:26:56.683
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

401
00:26:56.767 --> 00:26:59.686
I'm the artist here. clear?

402
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.979
Clear.

403
00:27:01.063 --> 00:27:03.107
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

404
00:27:03.274 --> 00:27:07.569
It was a mom-and-pop operation.
so small they called it The Kitchen.

405
00:27:07.652 --> 00:27:11.407
But make no mistake.
it would change Medell�n forever.

406
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.951
You know the thing
that has me worried. Pablo?

407
00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:23.419
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

408
00:27:31.093 --> 00:27:32.719
Let's build them a chimney.

409
00:27:36.515 --> 00:27:39.017
There you go.

410
00:27:41.103 --> 00:27:43.021
Gentlemen. the first three?

411
00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:46.566
If this business makes so much money.
why are you sending me coach?

412
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.693
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

413
00:27:48.777 --> 00:27:52.030
- Don't be a dick.
- No. no. don't give me that dumb shit.

414
00:27:52.114 --> 00:27:55.617
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

415
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.786
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

416
00:28:00.998 --> 00:28:04.835
Like her son. Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

417
00:28:05.544 --> 00:28:09.047
Hey. Mom.
how much do you think we can fit in there?

418
00:28:09.131 --> 00:28:12.551
- Around five kilos. honey.
- That much?

419
00:28:12.634 --> 00:28:14.052
Trust me. Pablito.

420
00:28:14.136 --> 00:28:16.096
I love it. Let's do it.

421
00:28:19.517 --> 00:28:22.102
- Pablo.
- Thank you. my love.

422
00:28:25.147 --> 00:28:26.440
It's Gustavo.

423
00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:28.650
Five kilos. right?

424
00:28:28.733 --> 00:28:32.279
Pablo loved his young bride Tata.
and she loved him.

425
00:28:32.363 --> 00:28:34.781
He was a family man till the end.

426
00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:38.035
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

427
00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:39.953
- Meet my friend.
- Hello. how are you doing?

428
00:28:40.037 --> 00:28:41.163
Hey. Pablo. this is Lion.

429
00:28:41.246 --> 00:28:44.375
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

430
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:46.793
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich. right?

431
00:28:46.877 --> 00:28:48.879
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

432
00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:50.506
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you. Lion.

433
00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:51.840
Here's three.

434
00:28:51.923 --> 00:28:54.552
We're going to need two more.
right. Mom?

435
00:28:54.634 --> 00:28:56.428
- That's right.
- Pablito...

436
00:28:56.512 --> 00:28:58.930
make sure it is not you
who wears it. OK?

437
00:28:59.014 --> 00:29:02.267
Look. my love...
it won't fit me.

438
00:29:02.351 --> 00:29:04.102
Try it on.

439
00:29:04.186 --> 00:29:05.396
Come here.

440
00:29:05.479 --> 00:29:07.272
That's it.

441
00:29:07.356 --> 00:29:08.773
Good. right?

442
00:29:11.318 --> 00:29:12.361
One...

443
00:29:13.612 --> 00:29:15.739
- two...
- Wow. it holds a lot!

444
00:29:15.822 --> 00:29:17.282
Three.

445
00:29:19.076 --> 00:29:21.119
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

446
00:29:21.203 --> 00:29:22.871
He looks really handsome.
doesn't he?

447
00:29:22.954 --> 00:29:25.832
Listen. Lion.
that jacket fits you very nicely.

448
00:29:25.916 --> 00:29:29.503
Yeah. Excuse me. ma'am. can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

449
00:29:29.587 --> 00:29:31.088
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

450
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:33.257
He looks very handsome. son.

451
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.675
Like a fag model. isn't that right?

452
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.680
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

453
00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:45.102
Welcome to the United States.

454
00:29:45.185 --> 00:29:47.854
Thank you. Have a great day.

455
00:29:47.938 --> 00:29:48.813
Next. please.

456
00:29:48.897 --> 00:29:52.692
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder.

457
00:29:52.776 --> 00:29:57.656
half Colombian. half German.
and 100 percent playboy.

458
00:29:57.739 --> 00:30:01.034
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

459
00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:02.911
Go figure.

460
00:30:02.994 --> 00:30:06.915
Back in '79. this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

461
00:30:06.998 --> 00:30:08.584
on a fleet of small planes.

462
00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:10.586
- What's up?
- What's up. son?

463
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:12.712
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

464
00:30:12.796 --> 00:30:14.298
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

465
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:16.007
Whoo! It's so hot.

466
00:30:16.091 --> 00:30:17.968
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

467
00:30:18.051 --> 00:30:19.428
You like my jacket. brother?

468
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:22.640
I got it in Colombia and look.
it has a little gift.

469
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.269
I was in jail for a while. remember?

470
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.398
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

471
00:30:31.482 --> 00:30:34.276
What you got there
is the perfect product.

472
00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:36.820
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

473
00:30:36.903 --> 00:30:39.739
It's gonna fuck up their brains.
that's for sure.

474
00:30:39.823 --> 00:30:40.865
Yes. sir.

475
00:30:44.578 --> 00:30:45.745
Here you go.

476
00:30:47.205 --> 00:30:49.333
Go on. There are five kilos.

477
00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:51.168
Where are you going?

478
00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:53.837
I'm gonna get another jacket.
brother.

479
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.256
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow.
all right?

480
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.138
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medell�n and Miami.

481
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:05.516
Drugs in. cash out.

482
00:31:05.724 --> 00:31:08.852
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

483
00:31:08.935 --> 00:31:12.397
And in no time.
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

484
00:31:13.524 --> 00:31:16.067
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes.

485
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:18.529
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

486
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:21.615
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

487
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.243
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

488
00:31:25.327 --> 00:31:27.787
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

489
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:31.667
Ten trucks. 20 kilos each.
going back and forth every day...

490
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.837
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

491
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.298
Pretty soon.
the Lion had to come up with new ways

492
00:31:38.382 --> 00:31:40.467
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

493
00:31:40.551 --> 00:31:43.178
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

494
00:31:43.261 --> 00:31:45.764
You guys are pilots.

495
00:31:45.847 --> 00:31:49.226
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

496
00:31:50.769 --> 00:31:55.148
Look. it's $150.000 per kilo.
so whatever you want.

497
00:31:56.775 --> 00:31:58.193
We'll take four.

498
00:31:58.276 --> 00:31:59.737
All right. much better.

499
00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:04.533
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

500
00:32:04.616 --> 00:32:07.661
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

501
00:32:07.745 --> 00:32:09.287
- See you later.
- Later.

502
00:32:10.706 --> 00:32:11.998
Come in. please.

503
00:32:17.128 --> 00:32:19.881
Look. here are the packets.

504
00:32:19.964 --> 00:32:23.552
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

505
00:32:23.635 --> 00:32:24.928
Easy. right?

506
00:32:25.011 --> 00:32:27.556
You swallow 50.
and I pay you $10.000.

507
00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:28.724
All right?

508
00:32:28.807 --> 00:32:30.892
But with you two.
we have a problem.

509
00:32:30.975 --> 00:32:32.894
You girls are pregnant. right?

510
00:32:32.977 --> 00:32:37.608
That's good. because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

511
00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:42.529
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

512
00:32:42.613 --> 00:32:45.741
And I'll pay you $15.000
to help you with the kids.

513
00:32:45.824 --> 00:32:48.285
All right? All right. Perfect.

514
00:32:49.244 --> 00:32:52.205
During the early '80s.
most flights out of Bogot�

515
00:32:52.289 --> 00:32:54.124
had several mules on them.

516
00:32:54.207 --> 00:32:56.293
They didn't even know about each other.

517
00:32:56.376 --> 00:32:57.961
And you know what?

518
00:32:58.044 --> 00:33:02.173
Getting in was easy. because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

519
00:33:02.257 --> 00:33:04.217
All we cared about was grass.

520
00:33:07.304 --> 00:33:11.809
Pretty soon. cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

521
00:33:11.891 --> 00:33:15.937
Fish. coffee. flowers. rubber hoses...
anything.

522
00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:34.998
But even that didn't do it.

523
00:33:35.874 --> 00:33:40.337
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

524
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.550
Do you trust this guy?

525
00:33:45.634 --> 00:33:48.219
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

526
00:33:48.303 --> 00:33:51.389
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh. for sure he's gay.

527
00:33:51.473 --> 00:33:53.099
But he's got good routes.

528
00:33:57.187 --> 00:33:58.814
- Amigos!
- Hello. Carlos.

529
00:33:58.897 --> 00:34:00.273
Gustavo Gaviria.
nice to meet you.

530
00:34:00.357 --> 00:34:01.608
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

531
00:34:01.692 --> 00:34:03.527
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

532
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.613
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

533
00:34:06.697 --> 00:34:08.198
Smooth.

534
00:34:08.281 --> 00:34:09.533
Let's get down to business.

535
00:34:09.616 --> 00:34:13.495
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

536
00:34:13.578 --> 00:34:16.832
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

537
00:34:17.624 --> 00:34:19.626
- How far?
- Miami.

538
00:34:23.505 --> 00:34:26.090
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

539
00:34:26.174 --> 00:34:27.926
Counting the gasoline.

540
00:34:36.727 --> 00:34:37.853
Carlos...

541
00:34:38.729 --> 00:34:39.855
Yes?

542
00:34:43.983 --> 00:34:47.278
What if we take out the seats.
the carpet and all the other crap

543
00:34:47.362 --> 00:34:51.157
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

544
00:34:51.241 --> 00:34:52.992
We'll leave the engine. right?

545
00:34:54.285 --> 00:34:55.787
How much more?

546
00:34:55.871 --> 00:34:58.289
About... 300 more.

547
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.336
All right then. Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

548
00:35:05.964 --> 00:35:07.758
Within months after meeting Cockroach.

549
00:35:07.841 --> 00:35:12.930
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

550
00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:17.601
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics. folks.

551
00:35:18.602 --> 00:35:21.772
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

552
00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:23.356
in the middle of the jungle.

553
00:35:26.025 --> 00:35:28.403
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest.

554
00:35:28.486 --> 00:35:33.491
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

555
00:35:37.495 --> 00:35:39.790
We brought you a little present.

556
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.167
Brazilians.

557
00:35:44.795 --> 00:35:48.047
Best asses in the world.
believe me.

558
00:35:48.131 --> 00:35:50.634
No. I'm not feeling well.

559
00:35:50.717 --> 00:35:52.260
- What's up. Cuca?
- Hello.

560
00:35:53.136 --> 00:35:54.220
Hey. Gustavo.

561
00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:57.682
What the fuck is up with you guys?

562
00:35:57.766 --> 00:36:00.435
You're flying around in planes...

563
00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:02.813
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look. Cuca...

564
00:36:02.896 --> 00:36:05.565
Look. let us explain what we have to...

565
00:36:05.649 --> 00:36:07.317
Wait.

566
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.695
From now on.
in all of my labs...

567
00:36:10.779 --> 00:36:15.366
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning. with a pool...

568
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.869
- And whores from Brazil.
- And whores from Brazil.

569
00:36:17.953 --> 00:36:20.371
- Just for you.
- One problem.

570
00:36:20.455 --> 00:36:24.375
These are my labs. Mm?

571
00:36:30.256 --> 00:36:34.469
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

572
00:36:34.552 --> 00:36:36.972
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

573
00:36:37.221 --> 00:36:40.308
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

574
00:36:40.391 --> 00:36:44.062
They were violent. crazy and filthy rich.

575
00:36:44.145 --> 00:36:47.357
Guys used to getting what they want.
one way or another.

576
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.152
How something like this
can make so much money!

577
00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:55.406
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

578
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.450
What do you think. Pablo?

579
00:36:57.534 --> 00:36:59.911
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

580
00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:01.663
I wouldn't get involved.

581
00:37:01.746 --> 00:37:05.000
Look. man.
I took a good look at the market.

582
00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:07.335
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

583
00:37:07.418 --> 00:37:11.798
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

584
00:37:11.882 --> 00:37:14.801
Be careful. guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time.

585
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.596
the Peruvians will raise the price.

586
00:37:20.098 --> 00:37:22.600
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

587
00:37:22.684 --> 00:37:26.104
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

588
00:37:26.187 --> 00:37:30.942
Well. guys. the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

589
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.405
You need a lot of creativity for that.

590
00:37:36.197 --> 00:37:39.659
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

591
00:37:39.743 --> 00:37:43.538
You deliver the product to me. labeled.

592
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:47.166
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

593
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.836
Better yet. Lehder will do it.

594
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.006
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value.

595
00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:57.594
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

596
00:37:57.677 --> 00:37:59.512
The potato business is ours.
We don't need...

597
00:37:59.721 --> 00:38:01.347
Deal?

598
00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:05.769
Deal.

599
00:38:06.477 --> 00:38:08.063
Sounds good to me.

600
00:38:09.522 --> 00:38:13.526
All right.
I will create my own routes

601
00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:17.155
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

602
00:38:17.238 --> 00:38:19.116
We expect nothing less. Gonzalo.

603
00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:21.576
Partners?

604
00:38:25.663 --> 00:38:28.458
We know your policy toward partners.

605
00:38:30.043 --> 00:38:31.711
Let's just call us...

606
00:38:31.962 --> 00:38:33.546
"friendly associates."

607
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:36.841
To Miami.

608
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.010
To Miami!

609
00:38:49.187 --> 00:38:53.691
When I started. a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

610
00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:03.618
And before long.
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

611
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.166
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

612
00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:18.175
Truth is.
we weren't even making a dent.

613
00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:22.428
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

614
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.857
Pablo's coke flooded in.

615
00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:37.401
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

616
00:39:37.485 --> 00:39:38.945
And I mean that.

617
00:39:39.779 --> 00:39:43.200
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

618
00:39:44.701 --> 00:39:46.203
And with the money...

619
00:39:47.286 --> 00:39:49.164
came the violence.

620
00:39:51.415 --> 00:39:53.334
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians.

621
00:39:53.417 --> 00:39:56.087
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

622
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:23.073
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

623
00:40:24.657 --> 00:40:26.993
Use 'em once.
then throw 'em away.

624
00:40:28.411 --> 00:40:32.498
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

625
00:40:32.582 --> 00:40:35.459
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

626
00:40:35.543 --> 00:40:37.503
to hold all the extra corpses.

627
00:40:39.714 --> 00:40:41.549
That was the first person I ever shot.

628
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:45.011
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

629
00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:07.825
Hey... it was self-defense.

630
00:41:08.034 --> 00:41:10.995
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

631
00:41:11.913 --> 00:41:13.998
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

632
00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:16.626
He sells drugs. right?

633
00:41:18.044 --> 00:41:19.921
- Yeah.
- Yeah. then fuck him.

634
00:41:26.928 --> 00:41:28.221
What happened?

635
00:41:31.515 --> 00:41:34.060
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

636
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:36.395
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

637
00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:37.814
Stay with me.

638
00:41:38.022 --> 00:41:39.482
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

639
00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.569
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

640
00:41:43.778 --> 00:41:47.115
By the time she got to us.
she was barely breathing.

641
00:41:47.198 --> 00:41:50.952
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils. rapid pulse.

642
00:41:51.035 --> 00:41:53.496
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

643
00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:57.292
but she had no residue on her nostrils.
no injection marks.

644
00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.504
We did everything we could.

645
00:42:02.588 --> 00:42:04.215
She died in the ER.

646
00:42:06.592 --> 00:42:08.386
We tried to save the baby...

647
00:42:13.891 --> 00:42:15.935
The baby died in my hands.

648
00:42:18.688 --> 00:42:20.190
I'm so sorry.

649
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.943
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

650
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:26.570
Two of the pellets split open.

651
00:42:28.447 --> 00:42:32.118
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

652
00:42:34.412 --> 00:42:36.122
No one survives that.

653
00:42:43.754 --> 00:42:47.175
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

654
00:42:47.258 --> 00:42:50.970
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

655
00:42:51.054 --> 00:42:53.223
Tell me something. Cockroach.

656
00:42:53.306 --> 00:42:55.933
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

657
00:42:56.017 --> 00:42:59.520
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

658
00:42:59.603 --> 00:43:04.567
If it wasn't for me. you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

659
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.444
Let me give you a piece of advice.

660
00:43:08.029 --> 00:43:09.906
Never say that to Pablo.

661
00:43:10.781 --> 00:43:12.992
He's not as forgiving as I am.

662
00:43:18.998 --> 00:43:21.084
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

663
00:43:21.292 --> 00:43:24.545
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

664
00:43:24.628 --> 00:43:28.466
Instead. he found another way
to get his fair share.

665
00:43:31.261 --> 00:43:33.888
Stop!

666
00:43:44.274 --> 00:43:46.359
What do you have in the spare tires?

667
00:43:49.153 --> 00:43:52.531
390 kilos. Pablo. We lost it.

668
00:43:53.616 --> 00:43:56.869
Gustavo. what do you mean
"we lost it"?

669
00:43:56.953 --> 00:43:58.829
Just what I said. we lost it.

670
00:43:59.914 --> 00:44:05.044
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

671
00:44:05.128 --> 00:44:08.172
Don't mess with me. Pablo.
We lost it.

672
00:44:08.256 --> 00:44:11.550
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

673
00:44:12.843 --> 00:44:13.970
Look...

674
00:44:14.971 --> 00:44:20.268
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

675
00:44:22.228 --> 00:44:24.272
So how did we lose a load. brother?

676
00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:27.733
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

677
00:44:27.817 --> 00:44:29.319
Know what I mean?

678
00:44:34.991 --> 00:44:36.659
And how much is he asking?

679
00:44:37.868 --> 00:44:39.245
Too much.

680
00:44:45.293 --> 00:44:46.794
What are you going to do?

681
00:44:48.129 --> 00:44:49.506
Come back. Pablo.

682
00:44:51.007 --> 00:44:53.926
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

683
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.678
Where are you going. Pablo?

684
00:44:56.387 --> 00:44:57.638
Pablo?

685
00:45:48.356 --> 00:45:49.773
What's going on. brother?

686
00:45:51.775 --> 00:45:53.110
Mr. Escobar...

687
00:45:54.487 --> 00:45:57.490
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

688
00:46:02.328 --> 00:46:05.122
Eat. Shit.

689
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.710
What if I shot you in the head?

690
00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:27.811
Are you sure about this. Colonel?

691
00:46:30.314 --> 00:46:33.276
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

692
00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:37.696
We're DAS. Ibarra.

693
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.740
What's that faggot gonna do?

694
00:46:43.286 --> 00:46:44.745
There we are.

695
00:46:44.828 --> 00:46:46.623
No. lower. lower.

696
00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:48.040
No that low.

697
00:46:50.585 --> 00:46:52.211
Ready.

698
00:46:56.674 --> 00:46:58.676
Another one. another one.
I'm ready.

699
00:47:02.846 --> 00:47:05.349
Pablo didn't know it then...

700
00:47:05.433 --> 00:47:09.186
but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

701
00:47:12.856 --> 00:47:15.151
Remove the handcuffs.

702
00:47:20.406 --> 00:47:21.991
You can go now. officer.

703
00:47:23.451 --> 00:47:24.994
Sit down. Mr. Pablo.

704
00:47:31.334 --> 00:47:34.128
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

705
00:47:36.046 --> 00:47:41.051
That's a street value
of over four million dollars. Mr. Escobar.

706
00:47:41.802 --> 00:47:44.221
And you only gave us $150.000.

707
00:47:45.764 --> 00:47:48.351
Well. that's what we agreed upon.

708
00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:51.395
You know something?

709
00:47:51.479 --> 00:47:54.524
I make deals for a living.

710
00:47:54.607 --> 00:47:59.654
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

711
00:48:03.366 --> 00:48:06.536
Or we can renegotiate.
come to an agreement.

712
00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:09.163
and everyone goes home happy.

713
00:48:11.708 --> 00:48:12.833
Deal?

714
00:48:21.008 --> 00:48:23.386
I'll give you one million dollars...

715
00:48:24.887 --> 00:48:26.972
under one condition.

716
00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:29.892
What is it?

717
00:48:31.977 --> 00:48:35.856
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

718
00:48:37.024 --> 00:48:39.235
Otherwise. how would you know?

719
00:48:43.072 --> 00:48:45.157
Give me a name...

720
00:48:47.368 --> 00:48:50.538
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

721
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:57.670
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

722
00:48:57.754 --> 00:49:00.923
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities.

723
00:49:01.006 --> 00:49:04.677
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami. too.

724
00:49:06.721 --> 00:49:11.975
Cockroach's dealer was Germ�n Zapata.
a Colombian with a plumbing business

725
00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:14.771
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

726
00:49:15.938 --> 00:49:20.693
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

727
00:49:23.987 --> 00:49:25.573
The plan was to trade vehicles.

728
00:49:25.656 --> 00:49:28.743
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

729
00:49:30.369 --> 00:49:32.955
1200 kilos.

730
00:49:33.038 --> 00:49:35.874
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

731
00:49:36.959 --> 00:49:39.462
OK. gringos.

732
00:49:39.545 --> 00:49:41.547
How's the plumbing business?

733
00:49:41.631 --> 00:49:42.965
Fine.

734
00:49:46.427 --> 00:49:49.430
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

735
00:49:51.223 --> 00:49:53.350
Come on. amigo. I'll show you.

736
00:49:54.935 --> 00:49:56.479
Everything was going perfect.

737
00:49:56.687 --> 00:50:01.567
Like I said. amigo...
100 percent pure.

738
00:50:01.651 --> 00:50:03.569
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

739
00:50:03.653 --> 00:50:06.322
Got a full load here. Murph...

740
00:50:13.912 --> 00:50:16.540
Don't move! Don't move.

741
00:50:16.624 --> 00:50:19.752
Don't move! Don't move.

742
00:50:19.836 --> 00:50:21.128
Get down!

743
00:50:24.548 --> 00:50:26.884
Hands! Down!

744
00:50:26.967 --> 00:50:28.051
Don't look at me.

745
00:50:31.555 --> 00:50:32.765
Fucking...

746
00:50:52.368 --> 00:50:56.914
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego D�az.

747
00:50:56.997 --> 00:51:00.125
after taking into account
all due considerations.

748
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:05.422
bail has been set at two million dollars.
or a bond of $200.000.

749
00:51:06.757 --> 00:51:10.093
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

750
00:51:10.177 --> 00:51:13.263
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

751
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.936
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars.

752
00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:23.733
paid by a wire transfer from. well...
why don't you take a guess?

753
00:51:24.983 --> 00:51:28.278
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medell�n by midnight.

754
00:51:31.073 --> 00:51:37.413
From '79 to '84.
there were 3.245 murders in Miami.

755
00:51:38.497 --> 00:51:40.708
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops.

756
00:51:40.917 --> 00:51:43.210
no one much cared about that.

757
00:51:43.419 --> 00:51:47.757
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

758
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.386
Billions of dollars a year.
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

759
00:51:53.387 --> 00:51:56.473
And that... America couldn't take.

760
00:51:58.058 --> 00:52:02.312
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

761
00:52:02.521 --> 00:52:06.567
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

762
00:52:07.484 --> 00:52:11.948
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

763
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:15.451
Whatever it was. the businessmen
came at just the right time.

764
00:52:16.159 --> 00:52:18.370
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

765
00:52:18.454 --> 00:52:21.832
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

766
00:52:22.666 --> 00:52:25.085
Drugs are menacing our society.

767
00:52:25.168 --> 00:52:28.714
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

768
00:52:28.798 --> 00:52:30.883
They're killing our children.

769
00:52:30.967 --> 00:52:32.760
It was classic Reagan.

770
00:52:32.843 --> 00:52:35.763
Folksy. direct and tough.

771
00:52:35.846 --> 00:52:39.099
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

772
00:52:39.308 --> 00:52:41.518
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

773
00:52:41.602 --> 00:52:45.815
So to my young friends out there.
life can be great.

774
00:52:45.898 --> 00:52:48.025
But not when you can't see it.

775
00:52:48.108 --> 00:52:53.322
So open your eyes to life. to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

776
00:52:53.405 --> 00:52:55.699
as a precious gift to His children.

777
00:52:55.783 --> 00:52:57.785
Say yes to your life.

778
00:52:57.868 --> 00:53:02.164
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

779
00:53:02.247 --> 00:53:04.708
No. no. no! No. Pablo. no. no!

780
00:53:04.792 --> 00:53:05.876
No. no!

781
00:53:10.506 --> 00:53:13.884
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world.

782
00:53:13.968 --> 00:53:15.970
only the cockroaches will survive.

783
00:53:16.053 --> 00:53:18.180
Leave that piece of shit there.

784
00:53:18.263 --> 00:53:20.140
I guess they were wrong.

785
00:53:21.976 --> 00:53:25.187
During his career.
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

786
00:53:26.063 --> 00:53:27.982
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

787
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:37.783
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

788
00:53:37.992 --> 00:53:40.036
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

789
00:53:40.995 --> 00:53:42.454
No way.

790
00:53:43.121 --> 00:53:47.668
He was a West Virginia farm boy.
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

791
00:53:48.627 --> 00:53:51.463
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

792
00:53:52.506 --> 00:53:54.008
It was his duty.

793
00:53:55.676 --> 00:53:57.803
Cocaine in Miami?

794
00:53:57.887 --> 00:53:59.805
Kilos from Colombia?

795
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:03.183
This was my war.

796
00:54:03.266 --> 00:54:05.769
This was my duty.

797
00:54:05.853 --> 00:54:07.646
And I was ready to fight it.

798
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.315
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me. too.

799
00:54:10.399 --> 00:54:11.608
Your ticket. please.

800
00:54:12.985 --> 00:54:14.152
OK.

801
00:54:14.236 --> 00:54:17.239
We had no idea
what we were in for.

802
00:54:18.615 --> 00:54:22.912
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

803
00:54:22.995 --> 00:54:24.663
OK. man. what do we got?

804
00:54:24.747 --> 00:54:27.875
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

805
00:54:27.958 --> 00:54:29.292
We got Lizard.

806
00:54:30.419 --> 00:54:32.170
Uh...

807
00:54:32.254 --> 00:54:33.672
We got. we got...

808
00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.386
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

809
00:54:39.469 --> 00:54:42.139
- Thank you for the gift. agent.
- No problem.

810
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.825
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world.

811
00:55:01.909 --> 00:55:04.912
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

812
00:55:05.955 --> 00:55:09.625
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

813
00:55:10.918 --> 00:55:14.797
In the world of drug dealers.
you do what you think is right...

814
00:55:15.714 --> 00:55:17.758
and hope for the best.

815
00:55:18.884 --> 00:55:21.470
Look at what happened. boss.

816
00:55:21.553 --> 00:55:23.889
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

817
00:55:26.725 --> 00:55:29.770
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

818
00:55:29.853 --> 00:55:32.982
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

819
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:39.738
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo. sir?

820
00:55:41.991 --> 00:55:45.619
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

821
00:55:45.702 --> 00:55:47.163
Half a million?

822
00:55:47.245 --> 00:55:48.455
Do it.

823
00:55:48.538 --> 00:55:50.040
As you wish. sir.

824
00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.297
Fucking gringos.

825
00:55:57.805 --> 00:56:04.421
