Welcome to the 15th annual Seattle
APl LGBTQIA+ Equality Gala!

3
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:04.523
Breathe.

4
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.318
Seattle. how y'all doing tonight?

5
00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:13.031
You should ask Jeffrey
for make-up tips. He's very talented.

6
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.324
Jeffrey?

7
00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.701
Lady Shu Mai.

8
00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:16.702
Ma.

9
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.705
Let's dance! Whoo!

10
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.334
It's giving mother. Come on!

11
00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.794
Yas. queen.

12
00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.928
Angela!

13
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.056
Angela! Come up here.

14
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.064
The next award goes to one of
the most tireless advocates

15
00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:49.860
for the LGBTQ Asian-American
community here in Seattle.

16
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.321
One of the founding members of APl PFLAG.

17
00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:55.198
she has volunteered countless hours
to our Chinese language hotline

18
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.909
and fried up countless scallion
pancakes for our dinner meetings.

19
00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:00.454
This year's recipient

20
00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.457
of the Christina Cho Ally Award is...

21
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.500
May Chen.

22
00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.308
Thank you. Marshall. Thank you. everyone.

23
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.436
When Angela's father passed away.

24
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.898
I knew it was my responsibility
to protect Angela.

25
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:32.152
When she came out to me.
I knew I had to be there for her.

26
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.696
I had to be the best mother

27
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.325
and love her unconditionally.
no matter what.

28
00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.702
Parenthood is an invitation...

29
00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.121
You should come to the PFLAG meetings.

30
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:46.124
I've invited her. She never wants to come.

31
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:47.709
Your mother has told us everything.

32
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.462
Like the time she found you
looking at lesbian porn.

33
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.798
and you told her it was
for a figure drawing class.

34
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.175
Yeah.

35
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.219
Oh. Have you met Lee?

36
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.553
Angela's partner.

37
00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.306
She's the executive director

38
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.433
of the Hometown Pride Social Services.

39
00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.310
Oh. I have heard so much about you.

40
00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:07.521
Oh. I'm sure you have.

41
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:10.691
Susan. did I tell you I'm gonna
be a grandmother soon?

42
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:11.733
So exciting!

43
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:12.776
- Yes.

44
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.778
Lee did lVF.

45
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.656
The donor is Taiwanese. He went to Yale.

46
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.616
He's a cardiologist.

47
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.703
- His sperm was very expensive.
- Oh.

48
00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.038
Well. my implantation
was a couple of weeks ago.

49
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.040
so we don't know for sure yet.

50
00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:28.625
But it seems good. right?

51
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.921
I mean. we're cautiously optimistic.

52
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.882
Just managing expectations.

53
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.302
The first time didn't work out.

54
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.680
The first time never works.

55
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.519
I told her not to talk about it.
and I just don't want her to jinx it.

56
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.771
It's okay. It's fine.

57
00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:51.440
She's just excited.

58
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.609
So am I.

59
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:02.784
I know it's scary.

60
00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:05.162
but we have to let ourselves
hope a little bit.

61
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.332
I hope the baby has your nose.

62
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.085
It's my mama's nose.

63
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.295
I'd like that.

64
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.257
I hope the baby has your eyes.

65
00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.843
You know it's not my sperm.

66
00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.428
I can still hope.

67
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.521
Why am I here?

68
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.065
Uh. you're here to appreciate the work

69
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.984
and celebrate your boyfriend.

70
00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.033
Second question.

71
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.659
Why are you here?

72
00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.245
For the free food and booze.

73
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:49.623
And to hang out with my cousin.

74
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.999
Thanks.

75
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.376
Last question.

76
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.712
Your social anxiety is killing my vibe.

77
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.840
Jake's on you. My anxiety is generalized.

78
00:04:58.924 --> 00:04:59.758
.H6y-
.H6y-

79
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.593
Hi! You survived.

80
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.094
Oh. barely.

81
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.638
Oh. thank God.

82
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.223
Oh. How'd it go?

83
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.392
Well. it was classic May Chen. Triggering.

84
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.228
Babe.

85
00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.232
I've not seen you do that since...

86
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.818
freshman orientation.

87
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.486
Freshman orientation?

88
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.987
Oh. you know.

89
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.698
when these two confused little idiots...

90
00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:27.035
Started their codependent
relationship with a bang.

91
00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.411
Rig ht.

92
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.789
I can't believe you guys fucked.

93
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.251
What do you think? I'm going to her place.

94
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.004
Hmm. I can't tell behind
all the hair and leather.

95
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.174
It's my type. Ls it cool if I bounce?

96
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:44.469
Yeah. Just text after.
so I know you're safe.

97
00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:46.137
- I'll be fine.
- Text me.

98
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.306
OKaY-

99
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.267
This hot mess is all yours.

100
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.852
Bye. babes. Mwah.

101
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.312
Kind of a mean thing to say
to your cousin.

102
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.106
Whatever. Peace!

103
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.233
Let's go see some student art.

104
00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:01.987
He made these?

105
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.072
Isn't that wild?

106
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.492
Fuck. yeah. Min.

107
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.580
I'm not being polite. I really love these.

108
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.124
- That one's my favorite.
- Mm.

109
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.627
Oh. I love this too.

110
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.380
You left me.

111
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.048
You looked busy.

112
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.467
Never too busy for you.

113
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.347
- Thank you for coming.
- Aww. of course.

114
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.433
Min. it's so beautiful.

115
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.814
Seattle. how we doing tonight?

116
00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.528
We could have carpooled.

117
00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.032
We love you. Shu Mai!

118
00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.367
- And lions!
- Woo-hoo!

119
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.952
Go! Wait. now you do the blinking.

120
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:51.870
Yes!

121
00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.372
That's perfect.

122
00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.377
Did you see that little twitch?
Oh. my God.

123
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.546
Why am I always the butt?

124
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.797
Beautiful.

125
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.844
You know. this baby
is gonna change everything.

126
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.846
No more late nights.

127
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.515
No. there's gonna be
plenty of late nights.

128
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.726
Just not like this one.

129
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.939
Chris and I will be very good guncles.

130
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.899
We can babysit anytime.

131
00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.818
- Yeah?
- L'll teach the baby art

132
00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.695
and Chris will change the diapers.

133
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:28.615
Poop? You're giving me poop?

134
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:29.908
Oh. my God!

135
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.836
- Good night.
- Good night.

136
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.129
See ya tomorrow.

137
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.720
So. what do you wanna watch tonight?

138
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.263
Housewives.

139
00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:55.642
- Ooh. Which city?
- Hm. any of them.

140
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.894
Oh. vintage Beverly Hills
with Camille Grammer.

141
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.856
Eww. Slimy.

142
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.025
Hey. that's expensive stuff.

143
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.237
Bye.

144
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:50.905
Goodbye.

145
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:26.483
Hey. birders. There's
a heron by the yellow irises.

146
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.652
And a wood duck drake swimming by.

147
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:33.740
You'll notice the white line
extending below the bill

148
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.909
and also above the eyes.

149
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.744
You mean the squealer ducks.

150
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.246
Yes. They are also called squealers.

151
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.790
You are so cute.

152
00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.249
Do you have a boyfriend?

153
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.834
You should have a boyfriend.

154
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.797
I've got a nephew
that I'm pretty sure is gay.

155
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.258
Okay. group. let's keep
migrating down this way.

156
00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.427
Maybe he's pansexual.

157
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.971
I think I saw some wrens.

158
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.214
Oh. shit!

159
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.983
Welcome. Please have a seat.

160
00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.944
I'm so sorry I'm late.

161
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.032
This quarter's paperwork?

162
00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.785
Your shareholder proxy forms
and trust receipts.

163
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.830
The wire transfer
will be processed this evening.

164
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:04.914
Thank you.

165
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.170
So...

166
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.130
The chairwoman is waiting.

167
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:14.799
My grandmother?

168
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:21.264
- Grandmother.
- You haven't answered my texts.

169
00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.142
I've been busy with school.

170
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.977
Aren't you done with school?

171
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.522
Lawyer Sun. give us a moment.

172
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.648
Of course.

173
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.659
Your student visa is expiring. is it not?

174
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:42.911
It is.

175
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:46.623
But Lawyer Sun is arranging an extension.

176
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.167
There is no need for an extension.

177
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.170
We are acquiring KPMH.

178
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.924
a multinational corporation
in control of 15 fashion brands.

179
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.552
They are looking for a creative director.

180
00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.596
- Grandmother.
- The board has already approved

181
00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.556
my recommendation.

182
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.394
You can now continue the family tradition.
make use of your talents.

183
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.521
and protect your grandfather's legacy.

184
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.982
I have told you several times.

185
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.361
I don't want to work for the company.

186
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:19.656
You are not working for the company.
You are the company.

187
00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:24.786
I've been too lenient
after your parents died.

188
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:29.749
I've given you seven years
to do whatever you want.

189
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:33.753
Your grandfather has grown impatient.

190
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.588
If you do not accept this offer.

191
00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:38.508
he will force you to come back to Korea.

192
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.302
Do you understand?

193
00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.229
Hey. What's up?

194
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.107
I just tried to use
the Discover card to get coffee.

195
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.818
Remember. we consolidated
that into the Visa.

196
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.569
We have to pay for this parenthood thing.

197
00:12:58.653 --> 00:12:59.612
Right.

198
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:00.905
Yep. Just cut it up.

199
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.407
I'm cutting it up.

200
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.992
Feeding it to your worms.

201
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.411
They're moth larvae.

202
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.830
and they're busy recycling polyethylene.

203
00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.332
Not sure their saliva breaks down PVC.

204
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.335
Okay. well.

205
00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.129
you get back to saving the world.

206
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.046
Love you.

207
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.216
I love you. I love you. I love you.

208
00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.094
Hey. would you check on Kenneth?

209
00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.305
He needs an agency referral
for the downtown shelter.

210
00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.806
I don't think he's 18 yet.

211
00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.267
You got it.

212
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.234
So...?

213
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.777
Do you feel any different?

214
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.406
I don't know.

215
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.909
Do I seem different?

216
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.746
Yeah. It's exciting.

217
00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.291
You are gonna be a great mother.

218
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.506
I guess maybe this one
feels a little different.

219
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.321
Hey. Chris. Morning.

220
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.325
Ahh! What the hell?

221
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.674
Shit.

222
00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.969
Shit. shit. shit!

223
00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.309
I'm sorry this one didn't stick.

224
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.397
Is there anything wrong?

225
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.232
All the tests look good.

226
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.859
But of course. age
may be playing a factor here.

227
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.156
It's not unusual for lVF
to take a few goes at it.

228
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.575
If you want to try again.

229
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:12.120
Just know that we don't recommend
more than three treatments.

230
00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.997
It's difficult for the patient.

231
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.722
We can try again.

232
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.850
We can't afford it.

233
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.226
We'll save up.

234
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.519
That could take us years.

235
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.104
I don't have years.

236
00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.607
We can take out another
mortgage on the house.

237
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.234
I'm not taking out another mortgage

238
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.987
just to have another failed lVF.

239
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.197
Okay? I can't handle that.

240
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.641
What if you did the IVF?

241
00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.396
What? No. this is important to you.

242
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.814
This is your thing.

243
00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:25.735
I mean. this is important to us.

244
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.863
I wanna have a family with you.

245
00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.159
You're younger. so you have more time.

246
00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:37.413
Look. it just feels selfish.

247
00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.874
Pregnancy is something
you wanted to experience.

248
00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:42.084
- not me.
- I'm sorry.

249
00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.587
Are you saying that I'm being selfish

250
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.340
- for wanting to be pregnant?
- I'm not saying anything.

251
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:48.508
It's just that...

252
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.843
Can you just drop it?

253
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.054
Would you fucking turn around?

254
00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:58.851
Ang. you can't treat me like your mom.

255
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.438
What the hell does that mean?

256
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.066
It means that you can be honest with me

257
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:07.235
about what you're feeling. what you want.

258
00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.988
You don't have to simmer
and not confront anything.

259
00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.741
Like your mom's speech at the Gala.

260
00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.162
What?

261
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.372
Nothing. I...

262
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.625
- I'm simmering.
- God! Can you please...

263
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.126
That is my way of confronting things.

264
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.253
- Oh. my God!
- People confronting...

265
00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.089
What the hell?

266
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.465
Min. stop throwing things.

267
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.092
Oh. my God.

268
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.009
No!

269
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:36.514
Why don't you believe me'?
What are you so scared of?

270
00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.724
- Min. Min.
- What is going on?

271
00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:42.270
Min proposed.

272
00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.605
Oh. my God. It's Cartier.

273
00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.357
- Congratulations.
- Uh...

274
00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.026
I tell you how much you mean to me.

275
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.486
- How much I...
- Bullshit!

276
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.113
Tell them why you really proposed.

277
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.908
I proposed because I love you.

278
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.493
Because I want to be your husband.

279
00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.453
Because his OPT visa
runs out in a few months.

280
00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:00.830
and he doesn't wanna go back to Korea.

281
00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.248
No! You're making this up.

282
00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.001
Your grandmother just threatened
to yank you back to Korea.

283
00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.794
I bought the ring before. It's just...

284
00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.422
weird timing.

285
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.550
I'm not gonna marry you
so you can get a green card.

286
00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.135
Oh. fuck green card!

287
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.804
I don't even want to be an American.

288
00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:17.888
Your trains are so slow.

289
00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.807
and I never know how much to tip.

290
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.393
What about your family?

291
00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.145
You come out. they cut you off.

292
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:25.104
We'll talk to you later.

293
00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:26.439
No. Stay.

294
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.237
Look. I am not gonna be responsible
for you losing your money.

295
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.574
Iam not gonna be responsible
for you being disowned by your family.

296
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.618
And I am not gonna be responsible for

297
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.454
whatever the fuck apocalyptic
coming out party

298
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.080
you have planned for yourself.

299
00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.457
It's too much.

300
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.212
Chris.

301
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:52.923
I love you.

302
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.636
Isn't my proposal...

303
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.348
throwing everything away...

304
00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:03.768
proof of that?

305
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.646
Oh. that's beautiful.

306
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:08.481
- Babe.
- It's romantic.

307
00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.400
There are other ways
for you to stay in the country

308
00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.361
while you sort your life out.

309
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:16.864
You could enroll online at UW
and take a Photoshop class.

310
00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.283
Or learn Google Sheets.

311
00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.202
That'll buy you a year to figure...

312
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.828
I don't want a year!

313
00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.247
I told you. I want a life.

314
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.251
And I'm already so good at Google Sheets!

315
00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.215
You shit-talk me in front of our friends.

316
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.801
Disrespect our relationship.

317
00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:41.138
As if a stupid green card
is the only thing

318
00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.932
I ever wanted from you.

319
00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.481
Wait. Min. Hold on.

320
00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.234
I only asked you to marry me...

321
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.405
because I thought you would say yes.

322
00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:09.750
Oh. my God. You two are the same.

323
00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.877
Just say something.

324
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.087
LVlin!

325
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.590
Oh. fuck.

326
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:18.801
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:23.597
It's okay. We knew it would be difficult.

328
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.933
Is Lee gonna try again?

329
00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.644
I don't think so.

330
00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.188
The expectation.

331
00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.732
The disappointment.

332
00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.860
It was really hard on her.

333
00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:42.116
You know. she asked me if I would do it.

334
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:44.577
What? The IVF?

335
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:49.331
- Weird.
- I know.

336
00:20:49.415 --> 00:20:51.709
Lee. I can see pregnant.

337
00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.044
Min. I can see pregnant.

338
00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:56.672
But you?

339
00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.924
I... Whatever.

340
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.135
Doesn't matter if it's Lee or me.

341
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:03.929
'Cause we don't have the money.

342
00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.473
So...

343
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.311
Lee would be such a good mom.

344
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.731
So would you.

345
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.153
You have mother issues.

346
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.864
It's not the same thing
as motherhood issues.

347
00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.033
Yeah. it actually is.

348
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:32.041
So. are you gonna do long distance
with Min in Korea?

349
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.336
Uh... I don't know. I think...

350
00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.130
we'll just take it day by day.

351
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:41.550
You've been taking it
day by day for five years.

352
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:45.054
Min. birding instead
of finishing your dissertation.

353
00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.306
Queer theory takes the joy
out of being gay.

354
00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.683
You live in our garage.

355
00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:52.478
Okay. you gotta commit
to something at some point.

356
00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.235
God. we're fuckups.

357
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:01.445
Dick's!

358
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:03.739
Dick's!

359
00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.992
I want to suck your dick.

360
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.496
I want more Dick's.

361
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:14.250
- Shh.
- Shh!

362
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.669
Shut up. Shut up. you fool. Shut up.

363
00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.671
Let's do it.

364
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.340
- Teenagers or something.
- I think so too.

365
00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:24.218
Or that we were 50? I can't tell.

366
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:26.679
- No in-between.
- No in-between.

367
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:33.561
Do it. I dare you.

368
00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.020
Do what?

369
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:44.238
No. Not again.

370
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.158
Will you marry me?

371
00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:49.702
Min. I can't.

372
00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:50.953
Not you.

373
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.454
I don't want to marry you anymore.

374
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.540
I want to marry her.

375
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:55.499
Me?

376
00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:56.458
What?

377
00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.963
We're friends. We help each other.

378
00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.631
OKaY-

379
00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:06.844
I heard all about the IVF.
and I'm so. so sad.

380
00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.054
But. until my grandfather
takes my money away.

381
00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:11.098
I have so much money.

382
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:14.101
I want you to have some
so you and Lee can have a family.

383
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.688
So. I have a proposal.

384
00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:22.985
You marry me. and I'll pay
for Lee to grow a baby.

385
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:25.988
You're joking. right?

386
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.532
He's joking. right?

387
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:32.411
I mean. it's... It's an idea.

388
00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:33.662
A very good one.

389
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.456
No! This is absurd.

390
00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:38.167
This is crazier than you marrying me.

391
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.002
You left me no choice.

392
00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.712
Okay. why is he proposing to me?

393
00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:42.880
You marry him.

394
00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:45.674
Hon. my entire career is being gay.

395
00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:48.844
I don't think we would clear
the green card interview.

396
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.095
I'm gay. too. remember?

397
00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:52.181
Yeah. but you work in a worm lab.

398
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.599
You don't talk to anyone.

399
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.894
I mean. you've been with dudes before.

400
00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:02.274
- Okay. I can't marry him.
- I can't either.

401
00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.485
Neither of you are marrying my boyfriend.

402
00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:05.819
So. you do want to marry me?

403
00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:06.820
No!

404
00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:12.242
This is all very hard on my ego.

405
00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:22.795
I'm still mad.

406
00:24:23.671 --> 00:24:26.215
You look like a ghost.

407
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:30.552
You're drunk.

408
00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:36.350
A hot. gay ghost.

409
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:40.813
Are you smiling under there?

410
00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:50.489
Just give me a minute to figure stuff out.

411
00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:55.536
I will. I promise. I just need some time.

412
00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:15.097
Dad loved this house.

413
00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:19.435
This is what he spent his life savings on.

414
00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:30.029
When he bought it. he. um...

415
00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.782
He said. “Angeline.

416
00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:37.619
We're keeping Duwamish land
in Duwamish hands.

417
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:42.833
They can burn our longhouses.
but they can't make us leave.

418
00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:44.543
"This is ours forever."

419
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.552
And when we moved in.
he said this was gonna be my room.

420
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.307
Ifl ever had a kid.
it'd be their room someday too.

421
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.775
Well. it's a good room.

422
00:26:08.817 --> 00:26:10.778
Yeah.

423
00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:14.031
And it's a good house.

424
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:16.617
Yep.

425
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.038
Good house with a fat mortgage.

426
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:27.002
It's a home.

427
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:32.508
Hey. leave it.

428
00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:35.427
What if I took up Min on his offer?

429
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:38.138
Come on.

430
00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:40.057
I'm serious. Stop.

431
00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.477
Look. I marry Min.
he gives us the money for the lVF.

432
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.482
Angela.

433
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:50.776
You're not serious.

434
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:54.238
Look. I'm a hundred percent serious.

435
00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:56.615
He wants to help us. We should help him.

436
00:26:57.199 --> 00:26:58.367
Min needs his green card.

437
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.244
and Chris needs help too.

438
00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:02.412
I mean. he needs time
to sort things out with Min.

439
00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:06.166
- Look. I...
- No. I can't.

440
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.544
I can't ask you to do that.

441
00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:13.090
If there's even a one percent chance

442
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:14.842
that this could work...

443
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.638
I want you to try again.

444
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:36.864
Okay. Yes.

445
00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:40.117
Yes...
what?

446
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.745
I'll marry you. You'll pay for Lee's lVF.

447
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:45.247
And I'll marry you.

448
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:51.962
Are you crying?

449
00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:02.931
Calm down?

450
00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:05.350
How am I supposed to calm down?

451
00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:06.643
Look at it this way.

452
00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:08.979
It's for the cause.
We're helping a gay couple stay together.

453
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.900
If they want to be together.

454
00:28:12.983 --> 00:28:15.152
they can get married themselves.

455
00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:17.779
Why did I put years of activism
into gay marriage

456
00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:21.033
- if this is what I get?
- You're getting a grandkid.

457
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:24.578
Play along until after Min
gets his green card. Okay?

458
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:25.871
Play along?

459
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:28.040
Tell me.

460
00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:31.460
What am I supposed to say
at my PFLAG meeting tonight?

461
00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:35.839
My own daughter marrying a man!

462
00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:47.142
How are you. Grandmother?

463
00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:49.311
You asked to see me.

464
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.188
Are you in some kind of trouble?

465
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.273
No. not at all!

466
00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:56.735
I just wanted to share some news.

467
00:28:58.487 --> 00:28:59.863
I'm getting married.

468
00:28:59.947 --> 00:29:02.074
- Married?
- Yes.

469
00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:06.119
Her name is Angela Chen.

470
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:08.789
- Angela.
- Yes.

471
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:13.418
- Who is her family?
- Her family?

472
00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:15.671
It's just her mother.

473
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:18.966
They're not a famous family
or anything like that.

474
00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:20.926
What does she do?

475
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:22.386
She's a scientist.

476
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:24.471
She researches plastic-eating worms.

477
00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:26.515
Plastic-eating worms?

478
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.392
Yes. it's eco-friendly.

479
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.357
Are you sure she's not marrying you
for our money?

480
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.067
Our money?

481
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.152
Well. in a sense...

482
00:29:39.236 --> 00:29:40.362
No. no.

483
00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:41.405
That's not it.

484
00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:43.031
- In what sense?
- It's nothing!

485
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:44.658
This is not about money.

486
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.535
We'll see about that.

487
00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.328
No!

488
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:49.496
What do you mean?

489
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:52.749
I mean. you can if you want. of course.

490
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:56.670
I'm just saying you don't need to.
She's not that kind of person.

491
00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:00.465
Gotta go.

492
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:17.190
You look like shit.

493
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.611
Hey. how's that situation
with your landlord. by the way?

494
00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:25.157
- Do you need my help?
- I'm fine. Stop babying me.

495
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:30.412
No. seriously. cuz.
You look like crap.

496
00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:33.373
- I didn't get much sleep.
- Why?

497
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:35.751
This is the perfect solution for you.

498
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:39.629
More limbo.
More of your millennial indecision.

499
00:30:39.713 --> 00:30:42.090
Just staring at birds.

500
00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:45.761
You get to maintain
your exquisitely ambivalent relationship

501
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:48.472
to the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

502
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:51.099
You even get to co-parent. or whatever.

503
00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:53.310
without any real responsibilities.

504
00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:56.146
You think I'm being stupid?

505
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.940
I don't think you're being stupid.

506
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:00.901
I just don't understand you.

507
00:31:06.114 --> 00:31:08.116
If I say yes to Min.

508
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.035
then his whole world comes crashing down.

509
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.620
and our whole relationship with it.

510
00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:12.788
And I couldn't handle that.

511
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:13.955
Okay?

512
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.542
Just don't overthink it.

513
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:23.924
You're kidding.

514
00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.634
Delete all of them?

515
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.635
All of it.

516
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.428
Every Pride Parade photo.

517
00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:30.347
Every National Coming Out Day post.

518
00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:33.517
Can I still post lnstagram stories?

519
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.893
Look. do you want grandchildren?

520
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.938
I'll delete lnstagram now.

521
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:38.855
Thank you.

522
00:31:41.775 --> 00:31:44.361
So. this is good.

523
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.032
When it's all over.
I'll have a whole new story

524
00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.575
to tell at my meetings.

525
00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:56.581
I'm just joking.

526
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.335
- Just joking.
- No. No. you're not.

527
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:01.503
This is all about you.

528
00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.213
What's come over you?

529
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:05.006
It was a joke.

530
00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.135
This has always been
all about you. hasn't it?

531
00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:11.930
Everything I do. I do for you.

532
00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.807
You know that.

533
00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:17.060
- Lee. tell her.
- Ms. Chen...

534
00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:20.689
I wouldn't be doing any of this
if I didn't love you.

535
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.277
Why do you think it took me
so long to come out to you?

536
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:32.451
And after I did.
you refused to speak to me for years.

537
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:34.619
Anything to avoid the subject.

538
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:36.872
Anything to not be honest.

539
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:40.500
And then you suddenly
appear back in my life

540
00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:41.835
as some kind of...

541
00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:43.587
supermom.

542
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:47.966
You never acknowledged anything.

543
00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:50.177
Or apologized.

544
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:54.556
Do you know how much that hurt me?

545
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:58.727
Iam making up for it.

546
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.772
God. I hate that people give you awards.

547
00:33:04.524 --> 00:33:06.776
I hate that people think
you're a good mother.

548
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:12.574
I hate that I feel like
I have to be grateful.

549
00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:16.661
'Cause I'm not.

550
00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:38.225
I guess I took your advice
and confronted things.

551
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.393
Yeah. you feel better?

552
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:41.937
No.

553
00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:44.773
Maybe. I...

554
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:48.902
Now I feel kind of bad for her.

555
00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:51.112
Yeah. well...

556
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.532
She needed to hear that.

557
00:33:53.615 --> 00:33:55.450
You needed to say it.

558
00:33:58.495 --> 00:34:00.664
Let's table this
for when we get home. huh?

559
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:01.873
What is it?

560
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:04.834
Surprise!

561
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:06.670
Oh. what is going on?

562
00:34:06.753 --> 00:34:08.964
Well. you and Min are getting
married next week.

563
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:12.634
And I felt like celebrating
our final days as gays

564
00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:14.928
before you become Mrs. Min Hyun.

565
00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:17.472
This is your bachelorette party.

566
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:19.349
This is so stupid.

567
00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:22.852
Exactly. You get to be
that straight drunk girl

568
00:34:22.936 --> 00:34:25.480
just rubbing up against
all the gay-for-pay go-go boys.

569
00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:27.524
Guys. grab your shots.

570
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.442
- Who wants a double?
- Here you go.

571
00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:32.696
Cheers. everyone!

572
00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:35.282
Cheers!

573
00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:39.869
I know this is stupid
and you're very smart.

574
00:34:39.953 --> 00:34:42.872
But sometimes.
it's important to be stupid.

575
00:34:43.582 --> 00:34:45.500
- Now. finish your drink.
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:50.672
Oh. let's go. drink.

577
00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:20.201
Hey. sleepyhead.

578
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:23.121
You wanna get going?

579
00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:26.499
Not yet.

580
00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:31.630
Hey. I was thinking.

581
00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:35.592
What if we took the money

582
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.594
and did something really fun with it?

583
00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.349
The IVF money?

584
00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:44.476
Yeah.

585
00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.686
Like. what if we traveled.

586
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.064
took time off. saw the world?

587
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.732
Just us.

588
00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.484
Okay. You're drunk.

589
00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:57.030
Okay. I'm drunk. So what?

590
00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:04.037
What?

591
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.831
I'm sorry. I just...

592
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:11.002
We're doing this

593
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:13.088
because it's something
we both want. right?

594
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.341
No. Yeah. Yes.

595
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:18.760
But maybe it's not the right time.

596
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:23.264
I just really like spending time
with you. You're so great.

597
00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:24.933
And you've always wanted to go to Europe.

598
00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:27.936
No. I want a child.

599
00:36:28.812 --> 00:36:30.480
I thought you wanted that too.

600
00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.607
I mean. if it happens. it happens.

601
00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:34.609
No. not for gay people. honey.

602
00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:36.986
I'm sorry.

603
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.614
Ang. where is this coming from'?

604
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:43.451
I...

605
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:47.580
I'm gonna be a shitty mother.

606
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:50.166
Just like my mom.

607
00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:54.295
And I don't want us to waste
our time and money

608
00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.715
and then fuck up our relationship.

609
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:58.550
Lee. it's not worth it.

610
00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:00.385
Okay. okay. look.

611
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:02.053
We can talk about your mom.

612
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:05.348
We can talk about all the rest
of this shit in the morning. okay?

613
00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:06.683
When we're both calm.

614
00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:09.269
Stop. Stop.
You are not my fucking therapist.

615
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:14.691
Okay. I'm going home.

616
00:37:29.748 --> 00:37:30.957
Marry me.

617
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.085
- What?
- Marry me.

618
00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:36.713
Min. Please. come on.

619
00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:38.006
It would be easier.

620
00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:39.924
You and me.

621
00:37:40.717 --> 00:37:42.343
What about Angela'?

622
00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:43.928
I already gave her the money.

623
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.223
Min. I told you...

624
00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:48.850
You told me you needed more time.

625
00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:50.059
I gave you more time.

626
00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:52.103
A week is not more time.

627
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:56.024
Then how much time do you need
to decide that you love me?

628
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.068
You tell me to be patient.

629
00:37:59.694 --> 00:38:01.362
You promised me we'll figure this out.

630
00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:03.573
I never promised...

631
00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:05.241
I'd marry you.

632
00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:14.042
Min. wait. Wait. Min.

633
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.294
Let me explain. Hold on. wait.

634
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:17.879
I'm staying at the studio.

635
00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:20.840
What did you do?

636
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:22.217
I don't wanna talk about it.

637
00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:23.927
Where's Lee?

638
00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.304
I don't wanna talk about it.

639
00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:30.183
Bar.

640
00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:42.862
Ever since I was a little kid. she...

641
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.740
She's never seen me.

642
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.085
I see you.

643
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.632
I see you.

644
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:05.802
I see you.

645
00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:10.014
- I'm never not gonna see you.
- I close my eyes and I see you.

646
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.405
Whoa!

647
00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:28.491
Chris!

648
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:31.494
NO! No!

649
00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.856
Motherfucker!

650
00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.406
Oh. shit.

651
00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:09.866
Did we?

652
00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:12.660
Fuck. Oh. fuck. Fuck!

653
00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:13.745
Fuck!

654
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:16.414
Okay. How do we. um...

655
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:17.790
Process this?

656
00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:19.751
We both had a shitty night.

657
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:21.002
Where we disappointed our partners.

658
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.046
And we needed. um... comfort.

659
00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.214
But we were both too drunk
to use our words.

660
00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:26.299
So. instead. we...

661
00:40:26.382 --> 00:40:27.717
Boned?

662
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:31.679
Oh. God. But we don't have any...

663
00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:33.848
Romantic feelings for each other
because we're best friends

664
00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:35.266
and we have no desire to...

665
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.476
Ever do this again!

666
00:40:38.478 --> 00:40:39.395
OKaY-

667
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.985
Oh. shit. It's Min.

668
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:47.403
Oh. God. Oh. God.

669
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:50.239
Hey.

670
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.911
No. Yeah. I mean. yes.

671
00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:56.579
No. Start over. Sorry. I wasn't listening.

672
00:40:56.663 --> 00:40:58.623
I'm sorry. No. no. no. Now I'm listening.

673
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.276
- Angela? Lee?
- Shh! Jesus. What is it'?

674
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.112
Hold on. hold on.
I'm putting you on speaker.

675
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:30.822
Okay. It's Min.

676
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:32.532
Hello?

677
00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:35.451
Hi. Uh. good morning. Angela.

678
00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:38.830
- What's going on?
- I'm on my way to the airport.

679
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.873
Because Min's grandmother
flew in from Korea

680
00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:42.750
to meet her future granddaughter-in-law.

681
00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:44.252
We gotta de-queer the house.

682
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.838
God. you have so much lesbian literature.

683
00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:49.507
Wait. wait. Min.
Is your grandma coming right now?

684
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.300
She called me from Customs.

685
00:41:51.384 --> 00:41:53.594
It was a big surprise. I'm sorry.

686
00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:55.847
Just take her somewhere else.

687
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.474
Nowhere else. She wants to meet you.

688
00:41:58.558 --> 00:42:00.435
If my grandmother thinks
you're marrying me for money.

689
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.562
she'll blow the whole plan up.

690
00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:05.898
Min. don't you think you can just explain
the situation to her?

691
00:42:06.941 --> 00:42:08.776
My grandmother and my gay...

692
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:13.031
Maybe she knows.
but we never. ever. ever say it.

693
00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:14.741
My grandfather hates gays.

694
00:42:14.824 --> 00:42:17.493
He's the biggest gay hater in Korea.

695
00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:19.495
- Jesus.
- Please!

696
00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:21.539
We just need to fool her for a few nights.

697
00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:25.209
We'll go to city hall Friday.
get married. she goes home.

698
00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:26.836
Everything's fine.

699
00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:28.880
How much time do we got?

700
00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:30.006
Forty-five minutes.

701
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.051
One hour. if there's traffic.

702
00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:35.678
Thank you.

703
00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:36.929
Okay.

704
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:38.806
What are we supposed to do. exactly?

705
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.600
Move all your gay things
into the guest house.

706
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:43.811
- Seriously. why do we...
- Clean now. talk later. ladies.

707
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:45.229
Come on! Let's go. go. go!

708
00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:46.939
Fine! Okay. okay.

709
00:42:47.023 --> 00:42:49.025
Vow plavmgl

710
00:43:11.506 --> 00:43:12.590
No. no. no.

711
00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:13.508
No.

712
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.593
It ties the room together.

713
00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:24.936
I don't think Min's grandma
will know that's lesbian.

714
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.980
The Indigo Girls are
surprisingly popular in Korea.

715
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.234
- You.
- What?

716
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:32.693
You look gay.

717
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.062
Everything in this house is gay!

718
00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:22.201
You must be very tired.

719
00:44:22.285 --> 00:44:24.328
Wouldn't the company penthouse be better?

720
00:44:24.412 --> 00:44:25.997
You'll be more comfortable there.

721
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.500
No. I will stay with you and Angela.

722
00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:45.933
Honey. I'm home!

723
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:53.107
Honey?

724
00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:58.029
I hear her.
I hear her. Get out of here.

725
00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:05.870
Halmeoni. this is Angela.

726
00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.540
It's so nice to meet you. Mrs. Hyun.

727
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:16.047
There are people in your garden.

728
00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:18.716
Go. go. go. go. go!

729
00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:21.552
Those are our tenants.

730
00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.013
They live in the guesthouse.

731
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.599
Lee and Chris.

732
00:45:26.682 --> 00:45:27.767
They're friends.

733
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:29.268
They're a couple?

734
00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:31.145
Uh. yup. Yup. Mm-hmm.

735
00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:38.361
He's very... elegant.

736
00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:51.415
Have you picked a wedding date?

737
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:56.462
Yeah. we have an appointment
at the city hall on Friday.

738
00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:57.880
Appointment?

739
00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.340
What do you mean. appointment?

740
00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:00.800
An appointment.

741
00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.427
- The marriage license.
- I know.

742
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:06.013
Getting your marriage license.

743
00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.723
But when is your wedding?

744
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:16.440
Angela and I decided
we don't want a ceremony.

745
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:17.858
No ceremony?

746
00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:19.026
Yeah.

747
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.070
It's not important to us.

748
00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:26.117
We just wanna get married
as quickly as possible.

749
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.577
Yes. While you're here.

750
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:31.163
We'll get married this Friday...

751
00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:34.625
And you can go back to Korea.

752
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.712
What is going on here?

753
00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.005
What do you mean?

754
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:40.214
No ceremony?

755
00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:43.050
What. is this sham marriage?

756
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:45.469
Halmeoni. this isn't a sham.

757
00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:47.763
Do you love her?

758
00:46:47.847 --> 00:46:50.558
Yes. of course. I love Angela.

759
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.684
- Um. can I...
- Really?

760
00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:52.685
Oh. okay.

761
00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:55.187
Of course.

762
00:46:57.523 --> 00:46:59.191
I am not an idiot.

763
00:47:00.568 --> 00:47:02.695
You want me to believe
you're sleeping with that woman?

764
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:05.489
Ew. Grandmother!
What are you talking about?

765
00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:08.117
You know what I mean.

766
00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:11.412
We never had to talk about this before.

767
00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:14.040
What did you do?

768
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:15.416
What trouble have you caused?

769
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:17.877
Or is she blackmailing you

770
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.088
because she's discovered you're gay
and from a wealthy family?

771
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:24.508
What? No. Angela is gay too!

772
00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:27.136
Even worse.

773
00:47:27.803 --> 00:47:29.221
A lesbian snake!

774
00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:33.059
She knows.

775
00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:36.395
You're a couple?

776
00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:41.442
You want a baby?

777
00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:45.071
Yeah.

778
00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:50.659
And you two...

779
00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:58.250
HOW long?

780
00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:03.464
Five years.

781
00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:13.349
What is this preposterous plan?

782
00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:15.768
Are you all stupid?

783
00:48:16.852 --> 00:48:18.270
Or is life so boring

784
00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:20.648
that you're determined
to ruin each other's lives?

785
00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:23.651
What did she say?

786
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.152
She said we're dumb.

787
00:48:26.195 --> 00:48:29.073
Your grandfather is expecting a wedding.

788
00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:32.118
Our relatives
and our acquaintances. as well.

789
00:48:34.995 --> 00:48:37.206
If only you had been honest
with me earlier...

790
00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:39.208
I couldn't be honest!

791
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.045
You never gave me the chance.

792
00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:49.844
I'm also to blame.

793
00:48:50.511 --> 00:48:51.720
I'll admit that.

794
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.224
But I thought...

795
00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:58.769
you would grow out of it.

796
00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.275
I'll correct my mistake.

797
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:07.903
We must have a wedding.

798
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.656
What?

799
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:13.492
No wedding is too suspicious.

800
00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:15.661
People will talk.

801
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:19.415
And Korean people
are very good at talking.

802
00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:23.335
I do not want people
to talk about our family.

803
00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:27.047
If your grandfather
hears that you are gay.

804
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.674
he will blame me.

805
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.719
and we'll have no money.

806
00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:37.516
You must have a wedding. For me.

807
00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.436
A wedding. Mrs. Hyun. I don't...

808
00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:44.982
I will have Lawyer Sun
invite our employees here.

809
00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:48.360
We will take photos
and publish them in the newspapers.

810
00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:51.655
Your grandfather will believe it
if it's in the newspapers.

811
00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:54.700
Your grandfather
doesn't have long to live.

812
00:49:56.452 --> 00:49:58.037
Neither do I.

813
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.124
It will buy us all time.

814
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:05.503
Do this for me.

815
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:11.509
and I won't force you
to join the family business.

816
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:19.934
Is that a promise?

817
00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:24.271
I promise.

818
00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:29.068
How long is this gonna take?

819
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:30.569
Three weeks.

820
00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.404
What do you think?

821
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:40.829
- Okay. Fine.
- Thank you!

822
00:50:40.913 --> 00:50:43.207
Thank you! Thank you.

823
00:50:49.672 --> 00:50:54.009
Why do they live in the house
and you stay in a barn?

824
00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:57.638
This is Lee's house.

825
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.949
I didn't mean for you
to find out like this.

826
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:21.579
I wish I could have told you
some other way.

827
00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:26.208
This is not the future

828
00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:28.002
I wanted for you.

829
00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:33.340
But I can't make you the grandson
I wanted you to be.

830
00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:43.767
Do you need anything?

831
00:51:44.393 --> 00:51:45.936
Can I get you some water?

832
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.440
I'm fine.

833
00:51:53.152 --> 00:51:55.029
Hey. can we talk about last night?

834
00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:00.993
No.

835
00:52:01.744 --> 00:52:03.537
No. we actually need to talk about it.

836
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:05.456
You can't cute your way out of it.

837
00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:15.841
Look. I was an asshole.

838
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:18.636
I'm sorry.

839
00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:22.389
What was all that shit you were saying?

840
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:27.102
Look. it wasn't shit. It was all true.

841
00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:32.274
I do wanna travel the world with you.

842
00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:36.862
And I do wanna spend more time with you.
just the two of us.

843
00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:43.744
And when the brat goes off to college

844
00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.746
or summer camp or whatever.

845
00:52:46.622 --> 00:52:51.877
we are gonna fucking live it up.

846
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:04.014
I'm sorry.

847
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.724
No.

848
00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:09.853
I'm the sorry one.

849
00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:12.064
For what?

850
00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:16.610
I wasn't listening to you.

851
00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:20.739
You told me you were not ready.

852
00:53:20.823 --> 00:53:23.742
- No. Min. It's not...
- I have no expectation.

853
00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:29.998
After this is all done.

854
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:32.543
we can talk.

855
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:37.464
But if you don't see a future with me...

856
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.051
I can't make you.

857
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.391
Good night.

858
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:33.729
This room could work
for the pyebaek ceremony.

859
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:35.814
I agree.

860
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:52.372
I know you've already been through this.

861
00:54:53.332 --> 00:54:54.666
Third time's a charm.

862
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.127
Anything worrying you. any discomfort.
you let us know.

863
00:54:57.211 --> 00:54:58.378
OKaY-

864
00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:02.966
We'll implant the embryos one at a time.

865
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.552
This might be a little cold.

866
00:55:09.014 --> 00:55:10.557
You got this. baby.

867
00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:12.810
You got this. Okay?

868
00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:15.813
Lee. Lee. Lee. Lee!

869
00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:23.403
Hey.

870
00:55:24.488 --> 00:55:28.200
I love you. I love you. I love you.

871
00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:31.537
I love you too.

872
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:38.252
Sorry.

873
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:39.461
- Sorry.

874
00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:40.504
- Hi.
- Hi.

875
00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.632
- Jump on in.
- Thanks.

876
00:55:48.053 --> 00:55:50.055
Do you not like the outfit?

877
00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:52.099
Did you tell her?

878
00:56:01.149 --> 00:56:02.150
Yeah?

879
00:56:02.234 --> 00:56:03.819
Hi. Angela.

880
00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:07.531
Grandmother and I were just talking about
our wedding plans and...

881
00:56:09.074 --> 00:56:09.992
And?

882
00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:20.794
Okay.

883
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:23.797
Kimchi!

884
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.301
Nice. Okay. kimchi!

885
00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:32.973
Beautiful. Ms. Chen.

886
00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.183
Can we have more light in the front?

887
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.148
Okay. Wonderful.

888
00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:44.610
Look at the lens. Perfect. Cheese!

889
00:56:44.693 --> 00:56:46.028
Cheese.

890
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:48.614
Excellent. Let's try looking more in love.

891
00:56:54.119 --> 00:56:55.871
OKaY-

892
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.623
Right down the lens.

893
00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:01.043
What are they talking about?

894
00:57:03.503 --> 00:57:04.671
Us being gay-

895
00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:09.551
No. Mom. Like an Olympic athlete.

896
00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:11.386
- I don't ski.
- Like in the Olympics.

897
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.930
Like this?

898
00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:14.932
Right over here.
- Okay. all right.

899
00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:16.558
- Let's not smile.
- Ls that okay?

900
00:57:16.642 --> 00:57:21.146
Angela's mother
kept talking about some meeting.

901
00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:22.272
Twist and turn.

902
00:57:22.356 --> 00:57:24.232
Some club for parents?

903
00:57:24.316 --> 00:57:27.069
Americans have a lot of clubs.

904
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.989
She wants me to come with her.

905
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:35.452
She says there's lots of talking
and laughing and crying.

906
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:40.999
Americans like to sit in circles
and laugh and cry.

907
00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:43.293
That makes your face look big.

908
00:57:43.377 --> 00:57:44.252
Mom!

909
00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:47.506
So. she's not insane.

910
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:49.424
Just American.

911
00:57:50.592 --> 00:57:53.053
Yes. Just American.

912
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.180
You're going down the slope.

913
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:56.682
There you go. Let's get closer together.

914
00:57:56.765 --> 00:58:02.354
Angela's mother is very pleased
that her daughter is a lesbian.

915
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:05.732
Yes.

916
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.658
Your friend...

917
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.454
Chris... Are his parents pleased. also?

918
00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:26.378
Yes. I think so.

919
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:29.464
Not as much as Angela's mother.

920
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:32.634
A normal amount of pleased.

921
00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.932
Have you met them?

922
00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:42.144
Yes.

923
00:59:33.612 --> 00:59:34.946
How you feeling about tomorrow?

924
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:37.491
Oh. I just need to get it over with.

925
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:41.620
Come on. You can have
a little bit of fun with it.

926
00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:44.039
- Fun?
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:46.249
You hate weddings. Are you serious?

928
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:48.210
What are you talking about?
I love weddings.

929
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:51.046
Okay. but you're just anti-marriage.

930
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:53.590
No. I'm anti-institution.

931
00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:55.842
I am pro-celebration.

932
00:59:57.469 --> 00:59:59.596
Seriously. weddings are...

933
00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.181
Weddings are great.

934
01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.266
They're culture.

935
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.812
They're... They're heritage. They're...

936
01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.313
Straight people.

937
01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:10.899
They're cake.

938
01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.277
You know? A little "Cha Cha Slide."

939
01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.239
They're exhausting.

940
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.950
Seriously. my mom's exhausting.

941
01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.284
Everything is exhausting.

942
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.953
It's like... Ugh.

943
01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.166
Except you.

944
01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.961
You're not exhausting.

945
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.725
I got some of your beans.

946
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.269
Eww.

947
01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:50.230
- Come here.
- No. No!

948
01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.233
- Yo. he's to your left.
- Oh.

949
01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.568
[guhshofl

950
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.236
- Headshot.
- Nice.

951
01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.823
Apparently. as best man.

952
01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:06.663
I would traditionally carry
a live goose to the ceremony.

953
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.958
Which is weirdly relevant to my interests.

954
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.752
But now everyone just uses wood carvings.

955
01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.882
What about an American buff goose?

956
01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.384
They're super chill. really docile.

957
01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.678
I think it's more of a health-code issue.

958
01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:23.805
You know. livestock near food.

959
01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:26.933
It's just gonna be a duck decoy.

960
01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:35.317
You ever. even for a moment.

961
01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.737
wish it was you getting married to Min?

962
01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:43.450
Not just the dick with the duck.

963
01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.535
Very funny.

964
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:14.648
Hi.

965
01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.569
This is yours. Was on the chair.

966
01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.196
I hope it's okay.

967
01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.156
Oh. Of course.

968
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.408
Please sit.

969
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.416
I did not know you are also an artist.

970
01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:37.003
Oh. it's just sketches.

971
01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:38.797
It's a hobby.

972
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:46.096
Min tells me you attended
many prestigious schools.

973
01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.558
Yeah. I guess I have.

974
01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:54.562
Uh. but I'm taking a bit of
a break from grad school.

975
01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:02.821
May I ask about your family?

976
01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.865
It's just me and my parents.

977
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:07.659
Only child.

978
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.205
I wish Min had a sister or brother.

979
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.166
It can be very hard alone.

980
01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:21.548
There was a lot of expectation.

981
01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.052
And it wasn't always the easiest.

982
01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.847
But my parents have come around.

983
01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.897
Where are your parents?

984
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:41.276
They live in Kansas. Wichita.

985
01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.569
Kansas.

986
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.238
The Wizard of Oz.

987
01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:48.658
Many white people.

988
01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.286
So many white people.

989
01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.415
Please get some sleep.

990
01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.210
Long day tomorrow.

991
01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.338
Weird day.

992
01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.385
Hey. best man.
Right over here.

993
01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:35.390
Good. Hold up the duck.

994
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.441
You look like Amidala.

995
01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:10.985
- Who?
- Padmé Amidala.

996
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.945
Queen of Naboo.

997
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.406
Star Wars! Natalie Portman.

998
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.449
You call yourself American?

999
01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.079
What happens next?

1000
01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:23.122
Just follow my lead.

1001
01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:41.474
Many. many blessings
to you in your marriage.

1002
01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:45.436
Whatever the future has in store for you.

1003
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.565
I hope you find happiness together.

1004
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.616
Ready?

1005
01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:10.044
What's with the cheers?

1006
01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.588
It's supposed to represent

1007
01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.715
the numbers of sons
and daughters we'll have.

1008
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.802
Jesus. Big family.

1009
01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.053
Yeah.

1010
01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:20.847
- Which ones are which?
- What?

1011
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.640
The jujubes and the chestnuts.

1012
01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:24.767
Are the chestnuts the sons
or the daughters?

1013
01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:31.024
Grandmother. which ones are
the sons and which ones are the daughters?

1014
01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.943
I forgot.

1015
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:35.445
Lawyer Sun.

1016
01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.864
which ones are the sons
and which ones are the daughters?

1017
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:42.744
I... don't remember either.

1018
01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:45.788
Does anybody else know?

1019
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.127
They'll have 15 non-binary children.

1020
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.503
Rock on.

1021
01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.715
Almost over.

1022
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.966
OKaY-

1023
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.176
Now the walk.

1024
01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:02.805
We do the lap now.

1025
01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:03.931
Ready?

1026
01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.226
Oh. my God!

1027
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.478
Shut up. Come on.

1028
01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:19.906
- Do not drop me.
- Mm-mm.

1029
01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:29.248
I don't feel good.

1030
01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.167
Look at Min sweat.

1031
01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:33.586
All the way around.

1032
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.588
Hurry up. I don't feel good.

1033
01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:00.113
I'm fine now.

1034
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.448
Look. I hope I didn't ruin things.

1035
01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.575
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

1036
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.245
Let me feel your forehead.

1037
01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.375
You're not hot.

1038
01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.751
Is it something you ate?

1039
01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.504
I don't think so.

1040
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.257
Are any of the guests still here?

1041
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.386
Most of them cleared out pretty
quick after the puking ceremony.

1042
01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.598
I'm sorry.

1043
01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:44.532
We're all done here today

1044
01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:47.452
and arrangements are set for city hall.

1045
01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:16.814
Here.

1046
01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:38.503
Angela?

1047
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.038
Honey...

1048
01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.249
It's okay.

1049
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.335
Everything's okay.

1050
01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:21.754
It's okay.

1051
01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:24.841
Tell Mama.

1052
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.468
What happened?

1053
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.221
What happened?

1054
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:34.600
Hey.

1055
01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.019
Angela.

1056
01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:43.693
Mom.

1057
01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:48.197
I know I'm not a perfect mother.

1058
01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.908
but I've learned so much from you.

1059
01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:57.957
You're probably not going to
be a perfect mother yourself.

1060
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:02.169
Maybe you'll be worse than me.

1061
01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:05.381
But you will learn too.

1062
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.759
Just like how I learned from you.

1063
01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.306
If this is what you want.

1064
01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:15.641
Mom.

1065
01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:17.643
I'm a mess.

1066
01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:22.398
You are a miracle mess.

1067
01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:25.067
Don't forget that.

1068
01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:30.448
I love you. Angela.

1069
01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:36.078
I love you. Mom. I love you.

1070
01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:51.761
How are you feeling?

1071
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.641
Are you okay?

1072
01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.979
Hey. um...

1073
01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:05.483
Can we talk in the guest house?

1074
01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:13.824
So...

1075
01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.285
This was...

1076
01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:21.499
Penis sperms. not test-tube sperms.

1077
01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.962
That's one way to put it.

1078
01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:31.717
- Are you two...
- No.

1079
01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.387
God. no. It was just this once.

1080
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.763
Unless you count

1081
01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.139
freshman orientation.

1082
01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.518
Wait. You were the top'?

1083
01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.730
Not really sure who was where.

1084
01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:45.731
Um...

1085
01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.442
Are you sure it was even me?

1086
01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:50.861
Because to be honest.
I don't even remember being...

1087
01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:52.196
Don't be even more of an asshole.

1088
01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:54.907
Even more of an asshole than what?

1089
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.867
Than me. Than us.

1090
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.744
We're both assholes. asshole.

1091
01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:00.621
How do I tell my grandmother?

1092
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.791
How do I tell Lee?

1093
01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:05.167
Tell me what?

1094
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.636
Oh. no. no. no. no.

1095
01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.013
Lee. wait.

1096
01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.140
- No. Ang.
- That's it.

1097
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.808
- I can't handle this anymore.
- Lee!

1098
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:22.184
Leave me alone for a second.

1099
01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:24.437
Please. I'm sorry.

1100
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.897
This is a pretty big bomb
to drop on somebody.

1101
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.691
Just give me a little bit of space!

1102
01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:40.453
Lee. I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about Chris.

1103
01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.080
Wait!

1104
01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.375
Please. listen to me.

1105
01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.794
Ang. I don't need
to hear any more details.

1106
01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.339
Come on. Can we just talk about this?

1107
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.343
Please. Where are you going?

1108
01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:57.636
Lee!

1109
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.903
He broke up with you?

1110
01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:15.029
No.

1111
01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:17.990
- I broke up with him.
- What?

1112
01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.283
He said he wants to figure this out.

1113
01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.118
- I just don't know how.
- Chris.

1114
01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.496
You're an idiot.

1115
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.498
You're telling me
that he loves you so much.

1116
01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.750
he's going through with this
even after you knocked me up?

1117
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.169
Just so that he can stay and be with you?

1118
01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.712
Do you know how absurd that is?

1119
01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:35.132
Exactly. He's wasting his time.

1120
01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:36.759
What? No. that's not what I meant.

1121
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.469
I'll be back for the rest of my things.

1122
01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.055
Chris. What...

1123
01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.403
I'm sorry.

1124
01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:00.116
I'm so. so sorry.

1125
01:17:27.685 --> 01:17:28.853
Angela?

1126
01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.522
I'm back.

1127
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.570
Angela was not hungry.

1128
01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:39.864
She's sleeping now.

1129
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.956
- May I?
- Sure.

1130
01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.666
Have a seat. please.

1131
01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:10.644
Delicious.

1132
01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.439
Min's favorite dish.

1133
01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.650
You're such a good cook.

1134
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.695
Wedding leftover.

1135
01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:26.493
Alcohol?

1136
01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:27.912
Ve FY-

1137
01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.336
What shall we toast?

1138
01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:40.674
To the bride and groom?

1139
01:18:58.108 --> 01:18:59.610
What happens now?

1140
01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:04.573
No idea.

1141
01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.928
Lee's fertility clinic follow-up is today.

1142
01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:29.890
Are you going to go with her?

1143
01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.810
She's not answering her texts.

1144
01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:37.648
Mom.

1145
01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.443
What if her IVF doesn't work?

1146
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.080
Angela.

1147
01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.881
What if she doesn't come back. Mom?

1148
01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:10.222
HYUN'S GRANDSON
MARRIES PRIVATELY IN SEATTLE

1149
01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:13.017
Why did they take photos of that?

1150
01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:19.440
I remember everyone looked so happy

1151
01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:21.233
in cousin Woobin's wedding photos.

1152
01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:24.695
They looked happy because it was real.

1153
01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:32.286
Grandmother. how was your wedding?

1154
01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.705
Did you enjoy it?

1155
01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:37.708
How could I have enjoyed it?

1156
01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:41.295
I married someone I didn't love...

1157
01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.715
like you.

1158
01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.347
This is almost over.

1159
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:53.682
Get your marriage license.

1160
01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:55.851
Lawyer Sun will take it from there.

1161
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.938
My stupid idea.

1162
01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:03.984
This is all my fault.

1163
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.615
I'm sorry.

1164
01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:33.972
I have spent much time here
looking at your art.

1165
01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.015
You...

1166
01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:40.104
bring these small
individual pieces together

1167
01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:43.190
to create something so meaningful

1168
01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:45.859
and beautiful.

1169
01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:51.490
I see that you have done this
with your own life.

1170
01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.285
I don't understand.

1171
01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:02.334
You were different from a very early age.

1172
01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.462
I sensed it.

1173
01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:09.341
After your parents died.

1174
01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:12.970
I tried my best to protect you
from your grandfather.

1175
01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.684
I sent you away.

1176
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:28.861
I was only trying to protect you
with money.

1177
01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:33.615
I never realized what you truly needed
was a family.

1178
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.953
But here.

1179
01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:39.621
by yourself.

1180
01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.166
you created your own family.

1181
01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:44.710
Just like your art.

1182
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.673
A family that you care for deeply

1183
01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.925
and that cares for you.

1184
01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:09.318
I hope someday you can do what you want.
because I couldn't.

1185
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:15.616
I hope you can love who you want.
because I couldn't.

1186
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.328
This is my wedding gift to you.

1187
01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:30.756
No matter what anyone says.
you are my grandson.

1188
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.098
Thank you.

1189
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.775
We've already done the embarrassing part.

1190
01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.735
Min just needs the license.

1191
01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:53.570
Anyway. that's...

1192
01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.406
not why I asked to see you.

1193
01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:03.747
When I was throwing up... again

1194
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:08.335
this morning. you know. I was
staring into the toilet bowl.

1195
01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:11.755
just kind of meditating. and...

1196
01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:16.051
I just realized that...

1197
01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:18.971
Yeah.

1198
01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.306
Maybe...

1199
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.935
You mean. I'm gonna be...

1200
01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:27.229
a dad?

1201
01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:30.232
Maybe?

1202
01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:32.859
Oh. Jesus.

1203
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.736
I don't know.

1204
01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:38.198
- What don't you know?
- Everything.

1205
01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.200
It's your decision to make.
but aren't you worried

1206
01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:42.327
that the kid is gonna end up like me?

1207
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:44.663
I'm worried the kid's
gonna end up like me!

1208
01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.708
Look. we fucked up.

1209
01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:50.002
We're lost. Fine.

1210
01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.963
But whatever decision
I make about this baby.

1211
01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:54.715
I'm gonna make it.

1212
01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:57.134
I will make the decision.

1213
01:24:57.718 --> 01:25:01.346
Maybe it's time you made
some decisions of your own.

1214
01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:15.110
You all right?

1215
01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:18.488
I make decisions.
I make decisions all the time.

1216
01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:20.324
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1217
01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:21.783
When I'm done cleaning your apartment.

1218
01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:25.287
I'm gonna play all the Kingdom Hearts
in-between games.

1219
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.624
including the one made exclusively
for Verizon subscribers.

1220
01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:30.167
Then. when I'm done with that.

1221
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.919
maybe I'll dive back in
and finish my dissertation.

1222
01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.714
How's that for getting my shit together?

1223
01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.135
I think Angela was talking about Min.

1224
01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.388
I love Min.

1225
01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:46.767
I love Min too much to let him down.

1226
01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.269
Or fuck things up.

1227
01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:52.147
Or hurt him more than I already have.

1228
01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:56.652
He is so good...

1229
01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:00.697
and I am not good enough.

1230
01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:23.178
When I moved here because of
all that shit with our family.

1231
01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.889
I felt kinda bad 'cause. like.

1232
01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:28.392
it seemed like you put your life on hold.

1233
01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:30.018
That's not true.

1234
01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.938
Just know that you can take
all this time and energy

1235
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.357
and focus on you. 'cause I'm good now.

1236
01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:38.485
Because of you.

1237
01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:41.279
And Angela and Lee and Min.

1238
01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:51.206
None of us are good enough alone.

1239
01:26:57.963 --> 01:27:00.632
I don't think you should be
scared about being a dad.

1240
01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:03.468
Because you've been
a really good one to me.

1241
01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:12.936
Love you. cuz.

1242
01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:16.898
Love you too.

1243
01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:02.652
- For richer. for poorer.
- For richer. for poorer.

1244
01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.780
In sickness and in health.
till death do us part.

1245
01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:07.407
In sickness and in health.
till death do us part.

1246
01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:08.450
Rings?

1247
01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.412
Under the authority vested in me
by the state of Washington.

1248
01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.664
I now pronounce you married. You may kiss.

1249
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.757
Up next. Hyun-Chen.

1250
01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:40.273
Sir. do I have to stand
on this side or that side?

1251
01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:41.733
It doesn't matter.

1252
01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:44.319
If there's anyone here
who can show just cause

1253
01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:46.238
why these two should
not be legally married.

1254
01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:48.990
speak now or hereafter hold their peace.

1255
01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.916
Great. Repeat after me. I. Min Hyun.

1256
01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:03.171
I. Min Hyun...

1257
01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.801
Oh. my God. no.

1258
01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:23.733
- Uh...
- Hey.

1259
01:29:26.152 --> 01:29:27.153
Hey.

1260
01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:34.202
Chris.

1261
01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.374
What's going on here?

1262
01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:46.548
Min...

1263
01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:48.592
Yes. I'll marry you!

1264
01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:50.677
- I have a whole...
- I don't care!

1265
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.846
Yes. yes. I'll marry you!

1266
01:29:52.929 --> 01:29:54.514
Yeah! Whoo!

1267
01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:06.318
