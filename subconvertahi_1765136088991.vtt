It's... It's almost like a dream.

When the antenna is close to the waves.
the signal comes through clear as day.

through the Demogorgon's eyes then too.

were you at the hospital yesterday?

703
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.633

704
00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:16.677
No. No. no. no.

705
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.307

I saw you there. but...

-Oh yeah.
-She's my friend.

708
00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:27.438
We're friends. Good friends. But. uh...

709
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.650
The thing is. some people
might not understand our friendship.

710
00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:36.113
Basically. what I'm trying to say is
if you were there and did see something.

711
00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:39.533
it might just be better if.
uh. nobody knew.

712
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.368
if it stayed between us.

713
00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:42.703
I didn't see anything.

714
00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:46.290
Sorry. It's just
I tend to be off-topic when I'm nervous.

715
00:43:46.373 --> 00:43:48.960
and you said that thing
about monster lair. and I thought.

and you get kidnapped by Vecna. and..."

What... Where are you going?

719
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.678
It's a mandala. Did you do this.
Mrs. Harris's class. fifth grade?

720
00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:03.307
So cool. Though. come to think of it.
it's not even really a mandala.

721
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.352
I mean. it's just a spiral.
Mandalas are usually concentric circles

722
00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:08.437
but it's the thought that counts.

723
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.022
Speaking of the thought that counts.

724
00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:14.777
is it a mandala.
or a mandah-la. or a man-dala?

But you said yourself
Vecna controls the hive mind.

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:07.338
which means he's a part of it too.
So. when he searches for his victims...

-He invades their minds.
-He sees what they see.

Mr. Whatsit to you?

through the eyes of Vecna's next victim.
