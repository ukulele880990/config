﻿1
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.263
Okay. Randall.

2
00:00:07.346 --> 00:00:10.848
today is gonna be a
big day of training.

3
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:14.253
-Years of notes in here.
-What's that?

4
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:19.454
It's nothing. But if a man
comes in with a white gardenia.

5
00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:22.770
you don't talk to
him. Only me. okay?

6
00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:26.085
You don't wanna get
involved. Got it?

7
00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:29.401
Guys. the police
report just came in.

8
00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:31.010
Accidental death?

9
00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:34.505
-You're the cuckoo chick!
-Cuckoo what?

10
00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:38.090
Lester likened all
the tenants to birds.

11
00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:41.136
Why does the shrimp
you're holding

12
00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.836
have a fingernail?

13
00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:48.216
It looks like there's some sort
of green fungus on the nail.

14
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.328
You've heard about my family's
ties to criminal activity.

15
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:57.272
Can you explain what
you meant when you said

16
00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:03.102
that your missing husband has
everything to do with our building?

17
00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:07.495
We own Clean-Ups. the dry
cleaner in the Arconia.

18
00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:10.451
How many guests
are we expecting?

19
00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:14.844
Just Althea. Tim. and a
few friends from Bayport.

20
00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:20.045
Nicky used to carry these decks
around everywhere he went.

21
00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:24.528
There's a map on the back
of one of Nicky's cards.

22
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:25.150
Hello?

23
00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.837
George Bernard Shaw once said.

24
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.793
"In gambling. the many must lose

25
00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:33.659
in order that the few may win."

26
00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.885
He also said some
pro-Stalin things.

27
00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:41.817
and he was kind of anti-cow.
which isn't relevant here.

28
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.414
-Mabel. can we cut that?
-No.

29
00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:45.575
Okay. great.

30
00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:50.327
At the onset of the 1910s.
the rise of the automobile

31
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.169
rendered the horse stables
under the Arconia obsolete.

32
00:01:55.252 --> 00:02:00.819
It wasn't long before some of
New York's most infamous mobsters

33
00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:04.942
found a new. more lucrative
use for the space.

34
00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:08.976
By the 1920s. the mob
had secret gaming rooms

35
00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.676
all over the city.

36
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.440
and none played host
to more power players

37
00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:16.409
than the Velvet Room.

38
00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:18.198
For over a century.

39
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:24.297
some of the most consequential
decisions in the city were made here.

40
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.547
Rumor has it.

41
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.018
this is where the Empire State
Building contract was awarded.

42
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:36.668
where it was decided that bars
could stay open until 4:00 a.m..

43
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:39.444
and where. at the last second.

44
00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:43.388
it was changed from
"Zachary Taylor Island."

45
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:45.447
to "Roosevelt Island."

46
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.277
Even as the fashion. decor. and
clientele changed over the years.

47
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.078
The mob.

48
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:57.010
Everyone from Lucky Luciano
to John Gotti wielded power

49
00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.774
over the five boroughs
from this location.

50
00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:02.833
known to an elite few.

51
00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.699
And that continues to this day.

52
00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:09.643
I always assumed the
Velvet Room was a myth.

53
00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:12.599
but it was right here all along.

54
00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:14.299
How did I miss it?

55
00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:18.602
Well. to be fair. it was
down a secret staircase

56
00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:22.546
that only opened with
a magic deck of cards.

57
00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.862
I wouldn't beat
yourself up too much.

58
00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:31.691
You know. this does make for a
good opening twist of our podcast.

59
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.186
Should I be videoing?
A lot of podcasts

60
00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.065
are doing video now.

61
00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:38.675
Do you hear that?

62
00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:41.990
-Is that...?
-Oh. my God. oh. my God!

63
00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:44.587
-Oliver. is that you?
-Mabel?

64
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.364
Are you okay? What's going on?

65
00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:51.847
I'm in the dry cleaners.
I found Nicky Caccimelio.

66
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.893
Oh. great! Can you
keep him there?

67
00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:56.951
Shouldn't be too hard.

68
00:03:57.034 --> 00:03:57.932
He's dead!

69
00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:00.619
Does he have all his fingers?

70
00:04:00.702 --> 00:04:01.780
His fingers?

71
00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:05.365
-Ugh! Geez.
-Okay. okay. just stay calm.

72
00:04:05.448 --> 00:04:08.501
and meet us at
Charles's apartment!

73
00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:12.983
And Oliver. whatever you
do. don't touch the body!

74
00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:18.993
The last thing you want is your
DNA all over a dead mobster's body.

75
00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:19.345
Ah!

76
00:04:19.428 --> 00:04:19.787
Ooh!

77
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.731
-Hey. watch where you're going. pal!
-Sorry.

78
00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:24.982
-Oh no!
-Whoa!

79
00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:27.848
Oh! Wha... What are you doing?!

80
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:28.200
Ah!

81
00:04:28.283 --> 00:04:32.144
I paid extra for starch.
I'll have you know!

82
00:04:32.227 --> 00:04:34.293
Uma. so fun to see you.

83
00:04:34.376 --> 00:04:37.339
Smells like somebody
died in here.

84
00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:41.013
You... you truly are
the building cut-up.

85
00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:44.329
Have... have you
ever tried open mic?

86
00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:46.298
Why are you sweating?

87
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:47.279
Excuse me?

88
00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:49.247
Why are you sweating?

89
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.640
Oh. I wasn't... I wasn't
aware that I'm sweating.

90
00:04:53.723 --> 00:04:57.225
Menopause is tricky.
even for us fellas.

91
00:04:57.308 --> 00:05:00.271
I gotta move out
of this building.

92
00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:03.766
-Oliver?
-What's with the dry cleaning?

93
00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.555
Oh. my God. Oliver!

94
00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.883
What the hell did you do?!

95
00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:09.672
Oh. my God. Oliver!

96
00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:15.232
What part of "don't touch a dead
body" did you not understand?

97
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.381
Well. I sneezed on him.

98
00:05:17.464 --> 00:05:21.145
I'm allergic to gardenias
and Martinizing.

99
00:05:21.228 --> 00:05:24.191
Look. I-I-I get
that this looks...

100
00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:29.662
-Like you've lost your mind.
-Like you've committed a felony.

101
00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:34.594
I was gonna go "A bit kooky."
but yes. those also work.

102
00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:36.832
Oliver. what did you do?

103
00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:40.506
It's really quite
simple. After sneezing.

104
00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:43.552
I had to clean my
essence off him.

105
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:48.035
and then I blacked out.
and the next thing I know.

106
00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:51.530
I am pushing a corpse
down 86th Street.

107
00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:57.809
And no one noticed you with a dead
body. pushing it in a laundry cart?

108
00:05:57.892 --> 00:06:02.382
Oh. please. this is Manhattan.
it didn't even crack

109
00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:07.134
the top three weirdest things
happening on the block.

110
00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:10.719
But why'd you bring
him to my apartment?

111
00:06:10.802 --> 00:06:16.458
Well. I... Obviously. I didn't
want a dead body in my apartment.

112
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:21.031
You only think of yourself.
This is so typical you.

113
00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:25.155
I have never brought a
dead body to your home.

114
00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:26.495
What is this?!

115
00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:31.696
Well. you've implied I've done
it before. which I haven't!

116
00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.305
Go fuck yourself!

117
00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:37.249
Believe me. I've tried
that. it didn't work.

118
00:06:37.332 --> 00:06:38.500
You tried it?

119
00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:41.097
-Guys!
-You've tried... What?

120
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.016
Can we focus on what to do with
this expired human in front of us?

121
00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.499
-Ah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
-He is so dead.

122
00:06:51.582 --> 00:06:56.790
I mean. this is it. This is
what we're all gonna look like.

123
00:06:56.873 --> 00:07:00.914
No. no. No. no. not me.
I have a signed napkin

124
00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:05.397
from the guy who did makeup
on Planet of the Apes.

125
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.430
and Rick told me no
matter how mangled it is.

126
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:13.554
he's gonna make my corpse
look like. tops. 35.

127
00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:15.702
I feel faint. I'm woozy.

128
00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:18.479
Do I look woozy? I feel woozy.

129
00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:20.627
Okay. calm down. woozy.

130
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.302
The dry cleaners
doesn't open until 7:00.

131
00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:28.695
Whoever put Nicky there
is expecting for the body

132
00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:34.614
-to be found tomorrow when they open.
-Right. right. right. right.

133
00:07:34.697 --> 00:07:39.726
So. we need to get Oliver's
DNA off and put the body back

134
00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.041
before they realize
we took it. Okay?

135
00:07:43.124 --> 00:07:45.728
-Good plan. Yes.
-I hate this.

136
00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:50.929
Now... does anybody know how
to clean DNA off a dead body?

137
00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.347
Okay. I think I'm off him.

138
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.919
I'm glad I got these wet-naps
from the wings place.

139
00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:01.055
-You eat wings?
-No. of course not.

140
00:08:01.138 --> 00:08:05.089
But you can't get the
wet-naps anywhere else.

141
00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:09.841
Well. at least now we know
he has all of his fingers.

142
00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:10.373
Wait.

143
00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:13.958
There's something
green under his nails.

144
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.555
just like our shrimp finger.

145
00:08:16.638 --> 00:08:19.242
That's F1 Grade Lachlan felt.

146
00:08:19.325 --> 00:08:24.713
made from the wool of the
now-extinct Scottish Dunface sheep.

147
00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:30.183
That's the same felt they have
in the Velvet Room downstairs.

148
00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:34.846
-What are you talking...
-Well. I used to deal cards

149
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.251
on poker night. and
you'd be surprised

150
00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:42.375
how different felts can
affect the card slide.

151
00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:46.498
You wanna get a good
toss and have the card...

152
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:50.353
My God. he managed to
make gambling boring.

153
00:08:50.436 --> 00:08:52.680
Can we get back to Nicky?

154
00:08:52.763 --> 00:08:56.265
Do we have to call
the body by its name?

155
00:08:56.348 --> 00:09:00.748
I mean. you're not even
supposed to name lobsters.

156
00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:05.321
Well. his name is the only
thing we know about him.

157
00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:07.110
It's kind of weird.

158
00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:10.246
First time we didn't
know a victim.

159
00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:14.998
It's easy to guess the kind
of guy he was. I suppose.

160
00:09:15.081 --> 00:09:19.840
-Oh. I can't stand to look at him.
-What's the matter?

161
00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:26.029
Thinkin' about what your corpse is
gonna look like in this apartment?

162
00:09:26.112 --> 00:09:29.254
I'm guessin' you're
gonna die alone.

163
00:09:29.337 --> 00:09:30.684
in the bedroom.

164
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:32.294
Or on the toilet.

165
00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:34.173
Also a popular pick.

166
00:09:34.256 --> 00:09:37.219
Why does this
always happen to me?

167
00:09:37.302 --> 00:09:41.342
Or maybe you'll make
things really interesting

168
00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:45.556
and die alone in a laundry
cart. huh? Twinsies!

169
00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:47.973
Except I didn't die alone.

170
00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:49.583
I got a hot wife.

171
00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:53.437
But I don't gotta tell
you about her. do I?

172
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.957
You little perv.

173
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.978
Okay. and this ends this
episode of "CSI: My Apartment."

174
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.935
-Let's take the body back.
-Um...

175
00:10:03.018 --> 00:10:03.646
Really?

176
00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:04.807
Hear me out.

177
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.865
We found the envelope.

178
00:10:06.948 --> 00:10:10.989
so we know that Lester
was in the gaming room.

179
00:10:11.072 --> 00:10:16.010
If you're right about the
felt. Nicky was in there. too.

180
00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:20.493
And if there's any chance
these deaths are linked.

181
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:24.796
don't you think we owe
it to Lester to find out?

182
00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:27.663
Linked? They died a week apart.

183
00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:32.864
He is wearing the same clothes
from the day of my wedding.

184
00:10:32.947 --> 00:10:36.000
He could have been
dead since then.

185
00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:39.405
Look at his gardenia.
It's not wilted.

186
00:10:39.488 --> 00:10:41.015
He died recently.

187
00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:44.151
I agree. something's
not adding up.

188
00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:47.915
Look. we handed Lester's
body to the cops.

189
00:10:47.998 --> 00:10:50.871
and they called
it "an accident."

190
00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:55.264
Are we really gonna do
the same thing with Nicky?

191
00:10:55.347 --> 00:11:00.017
I know it's kind of gross.
but this is an opportunity

192
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.499
for us to look for clues
we'd otherwise never get.

193
00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:07.635
Plus. it'd be good
for the podcast.

194
00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:11.490
I mean. I don't think
anybody's doing this.

195
00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:13.817
I do love a good "first."

196
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.570
Well. I guess it wouldn't
hurt to take a little peek.

197
00:11:18.653 --> 00:11:20.718
We're doing an autopsy?

198
00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:23.405
I said a peek. a little peek!

199
00:11:23.488 --> 00:11:24.835
Okay. yes. yes.

200
00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.791
Autopsy step one.
cause of death.

201
00:11:27.874 --> 00:11:34.249
Well. I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say meat cleaver to the chest.

202
00:11:34.332 --> 00:11:35.679
"Meat cleaver."

203
00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:36.211
Nice.

204
00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:41.681
You know. I always wanted to
get gunned down in a toll booth.

205
00:11:41.764 --> 00:11:43.650
Sonny Corleone style.

206
00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:47.953
But that dream went out
the window with E-ZPass.

207
00:11:48.036 --> 00:11:52.795
Still. this isn't bad. Better
than whatever boring way

208
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.931
you're gonna go
out. right. Savage?

209
00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:57.271
Time of death.

210
00:11:57.354 --> 00:11:57.713
Hmm.

211
00:11:57.796 --> 00:11:59.503
"Corpse is Cristy."

212
00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:02.459
That podcast about Cristy Tejas.

213
00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:06.403
the co-ed who died in
Corpus Christi. Texas.

214
00:12:06.486 --> 00:12:08.461
Oh. they got so lucky.

215
00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:13.213
The whole case revolved
around the time of her death.

216
00:12:13.296 --> 00:12:18.594
Someone's gonna have to check
to see if he has rigor mortis.

217
00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:19.306
Mm-hmm.

218
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:20.915
Fine. I'll do it.

219
00:12:20.998 --> 00:12:23.063
Ah-ha! No rigor mortis.

220
00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:26.110
So. he died in the
last few hours.

221
00:12:26.193 --> 00:12:32.029
Or the rigor mortis has already
passed and he's limbered up again.

222
00:12:32.112 --> 00:12:36.602
Yeah. it looks like blood
has pooled by his ankles.

223
00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:41.174
I don't think that's supposed
to happen right away.

224
00:12:41.257 --> 00:12:45.747
Probably a little sauce
from that meatball sandwich

225
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.973
I was eating earlier.
Oh! Bada-bing!

226
00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:52.827
Seriously. this is how
you imagine I speak?

227
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.591
I mean. I know I'm a
member of the family.

228
00:12:56.674 --> 00:12:59.188
but I'm personally offended.

229
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:01.786
I went to Cornell. you know.

230
00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:07.256
Okay. fine. I didn't go to
Cornell. but you didn't know that.

231
00:13:07.339 --> 00:13:07.788
Wait.

232
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:12.001
And there's this white
substance on his sleeve.

233
00:13:12.084 --> 00:13:15.137
-Maybe cocaine?
-Ooh. let me sniff.

234
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.249
I directed theater in the
'80s. I could probably tell you

235
00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:24.013
the exact street in
Colombia it came from.

236
00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:24.366
Ah!

237
00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.963
I think it looks like paint.

238
00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:27.495
Yeah.

239
00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:29.374
Gee. I miss cocaine.

240
00:13:29.457 --> 00:13:32.330
I'm sure it misses you too. pal.

241
00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:35.466
No sign of maggots
or blowfly eggs.

242
00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:38.602
And I was just
getting hungry. Ugh.

243
00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:40.032
Don't "ugh" me.

244
00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:43.796
What. your corpse is
too good for maggots.

245
00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:48.279
or whatever those other
things this girl said are?

246
00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:52.223
Rope marks. Ooh. this
could be a sexy crime.

247
00:13:52.306 --> 00:13:55.538
We probably should
check his nipples.

248
00:13:55.621 --> 00:13:59.662
-What's this?
-No. not the Sur la Table tongs!

249
00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:04.594
Oh. please don't say maggots.
Please don't say maggots.

250
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.460
No. it kinda looks like a burn.

251
00:14:07.543 --> 00:14:11.853
While rigor indicates
Nicky's been dead for days.

252
00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:15.708
the decomp level suggests
he died recently.

253
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:17.766
Wow. that was so cool.

254
00:14:17.849 --> 00:14:21.890
I know. I'm giving. like.
Meredith Grey vibes.

255
00:14:21.973 --> 00:14:24.038
You seem awfully cheery

256
00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.827
about this autopsy.

257
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.861
I know this is weird to
say over a dead body.

258
00:14:29.944 --> 00:14:35.331
but I feel like I'm in a really
good place in life right now.

259
00:14:35.414 --> 00:14:36.133
You are.

260
00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:39.089
You're doing your first autopsy.

261
00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:43.572
-Your new apartment is really shaping up.
-I know.

262
00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:48.055
It feels like I've earned
my spot in the building.

263
00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:53.884
And I feel... Oh! Wait. sorry. we
still don't have time of death.

264
00:14:53.967 --> 00:14:56.841
Ah-ha! What we
need is leftovers.

265
00:14:56.924 --> 00:15:00.515
Charles. what do you
have in your fridge?

266
00:15:00.598 --> 00:15:04.370
I think I have some
Chinese in the freezer.

267
00:15:04.453 --> 00:15:08.044
-but it's a couple of months...
-Perfect!

268
00:15:08.127 --> 00:15:12.707
All my greatest creative
breakthroughs have happened

269
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.214
over reheated Chinese food.

270
00:15:15.297 --> 00:15:20.325
What if this is the last thing
Lester saw before he died?

271
00:15:20.408 --> 00:15:24.090
-Me. yelling at him about shrimp.
-Oliver.

272
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.944
After all he did for
me. Am I a narcissist?

273
00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:30.541
No! I mean. just clinically.

274
00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:31.073
What?

275
00:15:31.156 --> 00:15:35.287
Mabel. what's the first
word that comes to mind

276
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.782
-when you think of me?
-Oh. narcissist.

277
00:15:38.865 --> 00:15:40.122
What the hell?

278
00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:43.168
How am I just
learning this at 55?

279
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:48.369
Look. you can't change the
last things you said to Lester.

280
00:15:48.452 --> 00:15:51.325
and you can't
change who you are.

281
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:55.629
We are complex characters.
We are flawed heroes.

282
00:15:55.712 --> 00:15:57.777
Flawed dudes. Flawed...

283
00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.386
...lucky fuckers.

284
00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:03.151
Sorry. I didn't mean
to get philosophical.

285
00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:06.107
Yeah. where is this coming from?

286
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.039
It happens every time I have
a dead body in my kitchen.

287
00:16:11.122 --> 00:16:12.110
Hey. buddy.

288
00:16:12.193 --> 00:16:12.462
Ow!

289
00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:16.586
Enjoying Oliver's famous
microwaved dumplings?

290
00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:20.979
He managed to make it
boiling hot on the outside.

291
00:16:21.062 --> 00:16:25.192
-yet freezer burned on the inside.
-Oh. please.

292
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:27.430
Oliver. you're a genius.

293
00:16:27.513 --> 00:16:31.105
Wow. where was that
word two minutes ago?

294
00:16:31.188 --> 00:16:34.241
What if the burn
behind Nicky's ear

295
00:16:34.324 --> 00:16:37.826
isn't a regular burn.
it's freezer burn?

296
00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:42.129
It would explain why the
body hasn't decomposed.

297
00:16:42.212 --> 00:16:47.869
He could have been killed days
ago. frozen. and just now thawed.

298
00:16:47.952 --> 00:16:52.441
I'm gonna check his lips
to see if they're chapped.

299
00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:57.283
The creative power of Chinese
food remains undefeated.

300
00:16:57.366 --> 00:17:00.599
Boy. if I had a
nickel for every time

301
00:17:00.682 --> 00:17:04.543
I've had a breakthrough
over some moo shu...

302
00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:07.679
Mabel. what the
hell are you doing?

303
00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:09.737
It's a piece of paper.

304
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.693
I mean. it's really
soggy. but...

305
00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:15.650
Is that the logo of the Arconia?

306
00:17:15.733 --> 00:17:19.863
Nicky had Arconia stationery
in his mouth? Why?

307
00:17:19.946 --> 00:17:23.987
Well. we'll add that to
our list of questions.

308
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.829
We should start thinking
about getting this body back.

309
00:17:28.912 --> 00:17:29.181
Oh!

310
00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:30.521
It's 6:45 a.m.

311
00:17:30.604 --> 00:17:33.298
We spent all night autopsying?

312
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:37.152
Damn you. murder. for
being so interesting!

313
00:17:37.235 --> 00:17:40.647
Okay. we got this.
We'll just make sure

314
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.040
we bring his body back to
the dry cleaner's place

315
00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:47.189
-in less than 15.
-Okay.

316
00:17:47.272 --> 00:17:49.606
Well. now it's 14 minutes.

317
00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:51.575
Not helping. Charles.

318
00:17:51.658 --> 00:17:52.107
Okay.

319
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.459
Hi.

320
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:53.709
-Hi.
-Alright.

321
00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:54.870
How are you?

322
00:17:54.953 --> 00:17:58.096
-It's Oliver.
-Oh. that makes sense.

323
00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:03.566
Just headed to the dry cleaners.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

324
00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:07.780
Oh. perfect! Um. I'm in
a bit of a time crunch.

325
00:18:07.863 --> 00:18:11.813
Do you mind dropping
off these shirts for me?

326
00:18:11.896 --> 00:18:16.206
I can offer you a free
therapy session in return.

327
00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:19.163
Oh. that actually would be nice.

328
00:18:19.246 --> 00:18:22.927
My DGA insurance lapsed
in the early '80s.

329
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.537
It's me! I stink!

330
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.301
So. let's all just
please drop it! Thanks.

331
00:18:28.384 --> 00:18:29.911
-Randall.
-Mm-hmm?

332
00:18:29.994 --> 00:18:34.663
The elevator's making that
weird humming noise again.

333
00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:38.337
Oh. okay... oh. no!
That's... that's bad.

334
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.808
Uh. the sound. is it more like
a "eee." or more like a "mmm"?

335
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:44.340
Okay.

336
00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:49.721
You know what. let me see what
Lester had to say about that.

337
00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:53.306
Hey. c-could you do
this somewhere else?

338
00:18:53.389 --> 00:18:54.735
-Oh!
-Thank you.

339
00:18:54.818 --> 00:18:55.716
Excuse us.

340
00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.505
What are you doing?

341
00:18:57.588 --> 00:19:00.372
The ledger that
Lester gave him.

342
00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:05.753
it looks like the same paper
that we found in Nicky's mouth.

343
00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:08.799
We've gotta get
our hands on that.

344
00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:12.563
You two go. I'll...
I'll charm it off him.

345
00:19:12.646 --> 00:19:14.622
-Oh. great plan.
-Yeah.

346
00:19:14.705 --> 00:19:15.154
Um...

347
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:19.008
Wait. did he just stick
us with a dead body

348
00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:20.977
that he brought here?

349
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.394
He's good. He's very good.

350
00:19:23.477 --> 00:19:26.530
Wait. why is there
paparazzi here?

351
00:19:26.613 --> 00:19:29.666
Ugh. they finally
found my address.

352
00:19:29.749 --> 00:19:32.084
It's not for you. Charles.

353
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.154
Oh. my God.

354
00:19:33.237 --> 00:19:35.033
-Mabel Mora?
-Althea?

355
00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:36.463
What are you...

356
00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:40.587
Actually. it's THĒ now.
I shortened it. T-H-Ē.

357
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.645
Isn't that just "The"?

358
00:19:42.728 --> 00:19:49.103
No. it's not. 'cause the "Ē" has.
like. the little line thingy above it.

359
00:19:49.186 --> 00:19:53.317
My team thought it would
be easier for my fans.

360
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.196
and they were right.

361
00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:57.793
Ever since the name change...

362
00:19:57.876 --> 00:20:02.365
I'm the number one most
searched artist on Wondify.

363
00:20:02.448 --> 00:20:03.526
Ah. So brat.

364
00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:07.200
Mabel. I'm gonna...
deliver this laundry.

365
00:20:07.283 --> 00:20:09.169
How is that possible?

366
00:20:09.252 --> 00:20:11.497
Oh. 'cause it sounds cool

367
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.927
and mysterious.

368
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.871
And also. anytime anyone
searches for a band

369
00:20:16.954 --> 00:20:21.084
that begins with "The."
my name comes up first.

370
00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:22.873
It's genius. right?

371
00:20:22.956 --> 00:20:26.458
I mean. you wanna
listen to The Beatles?

372
00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:27.888
"THE" comes up.

373
00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:30.934
The Spice Girls?
It's "THE" again.

374
00:20:31.017 --> 00:20:33.262
-Yeah.
-The Chicks? "THE"!

375
00:20:33.345 --> 00:20:37.565
Thank God I was unaffected
by their name change.

376
00:20:37.648 --> 00:20:42.497
But enough about me and my
success. How are you. Mabel?

377
00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.568
I am great.

378
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:46.434
-Ah!
-And it's so crazy and wild

379
00:20:46.517 --> 00:20:50.648
that I ran into you. but
I gotta... better run.

380
00:20:50.731 --> 00:20:54.053
Oh. my God. you
haven't changed a bit.

381
00:20:54.136 --> 00:20:59.523
I'll be seeing you all the time.
I just bought the penthouse.

382
00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:03.737
I'm sorry. you got a
place here in my building?

383
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.873
-Yeah.
-Bought. like an investment.

384
00:21:06.956 --> 00:21:10.009
or bought. like
you're living here?

385
00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:12.875
Living. And do they allow pets?

386
00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.640
'Cause I have an otter.
and my last co-op.

387
00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:19.416
they were such dicks about it.

388
00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:22.283
It's Bloody Mabel!
Bloody Mabel!

389
00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:26.227
THĒ! Can we get a picture
of the two of you?

390
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.028
Come on.

391
00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:30.793
Come on. You'll get
used to it. It's fine.

392
00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:33.390
Bloody Mabel! You're amazing!

393
00:21:33.473 --> 00:21:37.873
Really? You're gonna get
DNA on me all over again?

394
00:21:37.956 --> 00:21:43.164
Jesus. I thought you guys were
supposed to be good at this.

395
00:21:43.247 --> 00:21:43.696
Yeah.

396
00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:45.575
What's he doing now?

397
00:21:45.658 --> 00:21:46.107
Yeah?

398
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.087
Ah. Jesus!

399
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.313
I'm just fucking
with you. I'm dead.

400
00:21:50.396 --> 00:21:51.204
The fuck?

401
00:21:51.287 --> 00:21:52.275
Okay. okay.

402
00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:57.297
Just gimme a minute. I-I'll...
I can look through the...

403
00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.432
Get back. you
animals! Back. I say!

404
00:22:00.515 --> 00:22:06.442
You'll all get your waxed jackets
and New Yorker totes in due time!

405
00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:07.243
Scatter!

406
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:07.595
Mm!

407
00:22:07.678 --> 00:22:08.038
Wow.

408
00:22:08.121 --> 00:22:10.096
Thank you. Mr. Putnam.

409
00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:12.154
Oh. no problem. champ.

410
00:22:12.237 --> 00:22:12.956
Randall.

411
00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.745
Randall. the Champ.

412
00:22:14.828 --> 00:22:20.036
I just want to. uh. say that
you're doing such a great job.

413
00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:20.388
Oh?

414
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:22.357
Doesn't feel like it.

415
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.325
Oh. you're a natural.

416
00:22:24.408 --> 00:22:27.372
You probably don't
even need that.

417
00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:29.071
What even is that?

418
00:22:29.154 --> 00:22:31.219
A ledger. Here. just...

419
00:22:31.302 --> 00:22:34.983
You flatter me.
Mr. Putnam. You really do.

420
00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:36.773
You know something?

421
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:40.806
I wish all the residents
were as kind as you.

422
00:22:40.889 --> 00:22:42.865
Oh. I'm not that kind.

423
00:22:42.948 --> 00:22:45.911
Well. you are a
friend of doormen.

424
00:22:45.994 --> 00:22:48.598
No. I'm really not. actually.

425
00:22:48.681 --> 00:22:52.093
What are you talking
about? You just...

426
00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:54.960
This is the real Oliver Putnam!

427
00:22:55.043 --> 00:22:55.581
Sorry.

428
00:22:55.664 --> 00:23:01.231
And even though. you know. I have
my brownstone in the Village.

429
00:23:01.314 --> 00:23:04.726
and my cave upstate.
my team advised me

430
00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:07.413
to buy somewhere more boring.

431
00:23:07.496 --> 00:23:11.627
And I was like. "Oh. my
God. duh. The Arconia."

432
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.506
It's all old people.

433
00:23:13.589 --> 00:23:14.487
And Mabel.

434
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.443
You still living with your aunt?

435
00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:21.836
Yea... no! Uh. actually.
I have my own apartment.

436
00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:26.319
Yeah. it's a studio. but
it has everything I need.

437
00:23:26.402 --> 00:23:30.442
A bed. a spot to record
my podcast. obviously.

438
00:23:30.525 --> 00:23:33.399
You've never heard
of my podcast.

439
00:23:33.482 --> 00:23:38.690
Uh. well. they're making a
movie about it. so I don't know.

440
00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:43.262
It might be a big deal.
Eva Longoria is playing me.

441
00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:47.745
Oh. wow. I only listen to
podcasts to fall asleep.

442
00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:51.779
-What's yours?
-Only Murders in the Building.

443
00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:55.094
Are you sure that's
what it's called?

444
00:23:55.177 --> 00:23:59.038
'Cause I'm just not
seeing it in the top 10.

445
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:02.174
You might have to
click "See More."

446
00:24:02.257 --> 00:24:05.310
Oh. I didn't know
that was a thing.

447
00:24:05.393 --> 00:24:09.883
Okay. I'm clicking. I'm
scrolling. I'm scrolling...

448
00:24:09.966 --> 00:24:12.121
Number 17. that's great.

449
00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:12.653
Idea.

450
00:24:12.736 --> 00:24:15.340
What if I came on as a guest?

451
00:24:15.423 --> 00:24:18.027
You'd shoot right to the top.

452
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.277
Wow. uh. y...

453
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.144
You know. I don't think we need

454
00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:25.100
any. you know.
shooting anywhere.

455
00:24:25.183 --> 00:24:28.056
We're... we're
pretty successful.

456
00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:28.858
Totally.

457
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:29.210
Oh!

458
00:24:29.293 --> 00:24:32.974
This is my therapist.
and she is so needy.

459
00:24:33.057 --> 00:24:38.894
We've been playing phone tag for
days. but the offer still stands.

460
00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.222
Sandra? Honey. it's okay.

461
00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:42.921
How have you been?

462
00:24:43.004 --> 00:24:45.877
Psst. Mabel. I'm
rooting for you.

463
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.283
Trauma's hard. Sandra.
We all have it.

464
00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:50.623
"Death Alone"?

465
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:53.310
Isn't that. uh. Pablo Neruda?

466
00:24:53.393 --> 00:24:53.842
What?

467
00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:57.067
Big scary mob guy
can't like poetry?

468
00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:02.448
-Sorry. I just thought that maybe...
-You know what's funny?

469
00:25:02.531 --> 00:25:08.098
I spent the last few years thinking
about how fuckin' old I am.

470
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:12.491
And now that I'm dead.
everybody's gonna be like.

471
00:25:12.574 --> 00:25:15.358
"Oh. my God. he died so young."

472
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:18.853
Not sure that would
be the case for me.

473
00:25:18.936 --> 00:25:25.311
Well. you better get a move on. pal.
because death is definitely coming.

474
00:25:25.394 --> 00:25:27.639
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

475
00:25:27.722 --> 00:25:31.583
By the way. why the
fuck did I quit smoking?

476
00:25:31.666 --> 00:25:34.270
"There are lone cemeteries...

477
00:25:34.353 --> 00:25:37.136
"tombs full of soundless bones.

478
00:25:37.219 --> 00:25:40.003
"the heart threading a tunnel."

479
00:25:40.086 --> 00:25:42.061
"a dark. dark tunnel."

480
00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:44.479
"Death is drawn to sound."

481
00:25:44.562 --> 00:25:47.345
"Like a slipper without a foot.

482
00:25:47.428 --> 00:25:52.277
"a suit without its wearer.
comes to knock with a ring.

483
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.695
stoneless and fingerless."

484
00:25:54.778 --> 00:25:55.137
Shh!

485
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.530
I thought the body was
supposed to be hanging up.

486
00:25:59.613 --> 00:26:03.115
Who cares? Just write
up what they said.

487
00:26:03.198 --> 00:26:05.712
Time of death. this morning.

488
00:26:05.795 --> 00:26:08.668
Top suspect. Caputo
crime family.

489
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:10.996
Less we know. the better.

490
00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:15.838
-What the hell was that?
-Come out with your hands up!

491
00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:18.615
Hey. we must be
hearing things.

492
00:26:18.698 --> 00:26:23.367
Let's get out of here before
anyone sees us. alright?

493
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.977
I put Nicky back.

494
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.370
These cops that found him
are definitely crooked.

495
00:26:29.453 --> 00:26:34.661
-I think there's a cover-up.
-What... Charles. that's huge.

496
00:26:34.744 --> 00:26:37.617
And I'm sorry I left you behind.

497
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.381
No. I enjoyed risking
ten years' jail time

498
00:26:41.464 --> 00:26:44.338
in my neighborhood dry cleaners.

499
00:26:44.421 --> 00:26:48.820
But I'm glad you got to
catch up with your friend.

500
00:26:48.903 --> 00:26:50.699
She's not my friend.

501
00:26:50.782 --> 00:26:56.349
She... I mean. she used to be my
friend. but that ended poorly.

502
00:26:56.432 --> 00:26:59.126
She brings out
the worst in me.

503
00:26:59.209 --> 00:27:02.711
Just when I'm feeling
good about myself.

504
00:27:02.794 --> 00:27:05.398
she moves into the penthouse.

505
00:27:05.481 --> 00:27:09.881
She's literally looking
down on me in my own home.

506
00:27:09.964 --> 00:27:12.658
Screw her! You don't need her.

507
00:27:12.741 --> 00:27:16.242
You got your whole
life in front of you.

508
00:27:16.325 --> 00:27:20.905
I. on the other hand. much
like Pablo Neruda's poem.

509
00:27:20.988 --> 00:27:24.220
will likely experience
"Death Alone."

510
00:27:24.303 --> 00:27:26.638
That's dark. Are you okay?

511
00:27:26.721 --> 00:27:27.080
Yes.

512
00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:27.971
I got it!

513
00:27:28.054 --> 00:27:31.825
Oh. did you use the
old Oliver Putnam charm

514
00:27:31.908 --> 00:27:34.063
to get it away from him?

515
00:27:34.146 --> 00:27:37.648
S-Something like that.
It's a rich text.

516
00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:42.580
There are notes on all the
tenants. birdwatching notes.

517
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:45.806
There's even a poem
about a doorman.

518
00:27:45.889 --> 00:27:47.595
titled "After You."

519
00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:53.335
A journeyman's effort. He tries
to rhyme "cough" with "through."

520
00:27:53.418 --> 00:27:55.573
-The missing page.
-Wait.

521
00:27:55.656 --> 00:27:57.362
Ooh. money amounts.

522
00:27:57.445 --> 00:28:00.318
"Gun. blind." Oh. this is juicy.

523
00:28:00.401 --> 00:28:03.544
"Brown-headed
cowbird. Eurasian jay.

524
00:28:03.627 --> 00:28:05.333
kākāpō. bowerbird."

525
00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:08.559
Are you kidding me.
more bird notes?

526
00:28:08.642 --> 00:28:12.413
So. Nicky had a list
of birds in his mouth.

527
00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:18.153
But why are they all in a circle
with dollar amounts under them?

528
00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:22.546
Well. "gun. blind. river."
those are poker terms.

529
00:28:22.629 --> 00:28:26.580
So what. Lester was
working on a bird version

530
00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:28.638
of dogs playing poker?

531
00:28:28.721 --> 00:28:32.672
God. this is more
embarrassing than the poem.

532
00:28:32.755 --> 00:28:37.514
Lester's wife said he liked
comparing people to birds.

533
00:28:37.597 --> 00:28:40.291
So. maybe these are code names

534
00:28:40.374 --> 00:28:43.337
for people he was
keeping tabs on?

535
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.089
And those dollar amounts
were what they were betting?

536
00:28:48.172 --> 00:28:49.788
Wow. that's a lot.

537
00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:53.373
Ooh. and things are
back to being juicy.

538
00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:57.676
Looks like each page is
a different week's game.

539
00:28:57.759 --> 00:29:00.543
They play Saturday at midnight.

540
00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:04.307
which means there might
be a game tonight.

541
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.802
-We have to go.
-It starts at midnight?

542
00:29:07.885 --> 00:29:12.644
I've already gotten up three
times to pee by midnight.

543
00:29:12.727 --> 00:29:17.576
Well. figure it out. because
the players who were there

544
00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:21.700
the night Nicky and
Lester died might be back.

545
00:29:21.783 --> 00:29:25.644
So. I say we go early.
find a place to hide.

546
00:29:25.727 --> 00:29:27.612
and see who they are.

547
00:29:27.695 --> 00:29:32.185
Okay. but if we're gonna
infiltrate a midnight game

548
00:29:32.268 --> 00:29:36.668
of New York's scariest and
most powerful mobsters.

549
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:38.457
first. we must nap.

550
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.887
-Oh yeah.
-Yeah.

551
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.561
Man. you can do this.
You can do it. man.

552
00:29:43.644 --> 00:29:46.518
Come on. Randall. You can do it.

553
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:47.768
You got this.

554
00:29:47.851 --> 00:29:50.635
-Randall?
-Um. how may I help...

555
00:29:50.718 --> 00:29:52.064
Oh. Mr. Putnam.

556
00:29:52.147 --> 00:29:55.290
I'm just. uh.
returning your ledger.

557
00:29:55.373 --> 00:30:00.312
And I'm... I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding earlier.

558
00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:03.358
Well. you ripped
it from my hands.

559
00:30:03.441 --> 00:30:09.008
Yes. the misunderstanding was
you didn't think I would do that.

560
00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:11.426
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

561
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.778
No.

562
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:15.722
The building's falling
apart without Lester.

563
00:30:15.805 --> 00:30:20.654
And to be honest. I didn't
finish my training with him.

564
00:30:20.737 --> 00:30:24.149
so there's no way I
can fill his shoes.

565
00:30:24.232 --> 00:30:30.248
Have I ever told you the story about
when Sheena Easton played Moses

566
00:30:30.331 --> 00:30:35.539
in my gender-bending musical
twist on The Ten Commandments?

567
00:30:35.622 --> 00:30:39.752
Oh. no. the ledger
mentioned this might happen.

568
00:30:39.835 --> 00:30:45.223
So. okay. it was our opening
night. and a then-unknown Sheena

569
00:30:45.306 --> 00:30:50.873
was trying to fill the unfillable
shoes of Mr. Charlton Heston.

570
00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:51.225
Hm.

571
00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:56.516
And it... it... it just went
horribly wrong. People rioted.

572
00:30:56.599 --> 00:31:01.987
And it definitely didn't have
anything to do with the script.

573
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.314
-Hmm.
-So. I sat her down.

574
00:31:04.397 --> 00:31:09.426
and I told her. "Sheena-baneena.
stop trying to be Chuck"

575
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:12.831
and start trying to
be fillet mignon."

576
00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:16.236
And from then on.
the rest is history.

577
00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:19.013
So. the musical was a success?

578
00:31:19.096 --> 00:31:21.072
I said it was history.

579
00:31:21.155 --> 00:31:24.567
Point is. it's hard
to follow a legend.

580
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.164
so stop trying to be Lester.

581
00:31:27.247 --> 00:31:30.120
You can't be
somebody you're not.

582
00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:35.591
I still have a lot of follow-up
questions about this musical.

583
00:31:35.674 --> 00:31:39.535
but I think I get what
you're trying to say.

584
00:31:39.618 --> 00:31:41.593
Thank you. Mr. Putnam.

585
00:31:41.676 --> 00:31:45.986
And I don't care what you
say. you're a good guy.

586
00:31:46.069 --> 00:31:47.865
Ah. well. thank you.

587
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:51.989
And. um. I know this
might be hard to believe.

588
00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:55.214
given my boyish
good looks. but. uh.

589
00:31:55.297 --> 00:31:59.787
I've actually lived in this
building quite a while.

590
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.641
So. if you wanted. I
could try and help you

591
00:32:03.724 --> 00:32:06.328
finish some of that training.

592
00:32:06.411 --> 00:32:07.578
-Really?
-Yes.

593
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:11.433
A-Any question you
have. please come to me.

594
00:32:11.516 --> 00:32:17.262
Uh. I actually have a bunch of
questions. Can we start right now?

595
00:32:17.345 --> 00:32:21.835
No. Right now. I have to
take a very important nap.

596
00:32:21.918 --> 00:32:24.791
But. I would say any other time.

597
00:32:24.874 --> 00:32:27.389
I promise. I'm there for ya.

598
00:32:27.472 --> 00:32:30.614
-Thank you. Mr. Putnam.
-You got it.

599
00:32:30.697 --> 00:32:32.852
"Death lies in our beds:"

600
00:32:32.935 --> 00:32:36.796
"In the lazy mattresses.
the black blankets.

601
00:32:36.879 --> 00:32:41.099
"lives a full stretch and
then suddenly blows...

602
00:32:41.182 --> 00:32:45.133
"blows sound unknown.
filling out the sheets.

603
00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:48.808
"And there are beds
sailing into a harbor

604
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:51.046
"where death is waiting.

605
00:32:51.129 --> 00:32:53.194
dressed as an admiral."

606
00:32:53.277 --> 00:32:53.547
Hi.

607
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.580
Uh. this is anonymous
patient General Custer.

608
00:32:57.663 --> 00:33:04.488
and I'm in Dr. Tidyman's trial group.
and I'd like to get the next four doses

609
00:33:04.571 --> 00:33:06.815
of 4-8-3-7-6-3-2-8-X-Y-T.

610
00:33:06.898 --> 00:33:09.233
And I run out on Thursday.

611
00:33:09.316 --> 00:33:13.087
so I'd like to get it
delivered right away.

612
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.517
General Custer.

613
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.653
It's good we're
getting here early.

614
00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:22.585
People get whole new identities
to hide from the mafia.

615
00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:25.811
and we're breaking
laws to see them.

616
00:33:25.894 --> 00:33:26.971
It's locked.

617
00:33:27.054 --> 00:33:30.376
I discovered it opens
with a key card.

618
00:33:30.459 --> 00:33:31.627
Give me that.

619
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:32.428
Finesse.

620
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:32.870
Wow!

621
00:33:32.953 --> 00:33:37.353
This was really under the
Arconia all these years?

622
00:33:37.436 --> 00:33:41.477
Yes. and Lester and Nicky
have both been here.

623
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.510
This room has gotta hold
some answers for us.

624
00:33:45.593 --> 00:33:49.275
Wait. wait. They don't
look like mobsters.

625
00:33:49.358 --> 00:33:52.501
Those aren't mobsters.
They're CEOs.

626
00:33:52.584 --> 00:33:55.098
Oh. right. I recognize them.

627
00:33:55.181 --> 00:33:58.683
He's the one who
invented the one thing.

628
00:33:58.766 --> 00:34:02.986
And didn't she go to space
with Gayle and Oprah?

629
00:34:03.069 --> 00:34:04.865
Here. I'll Safari it.

630
00:34:04.948 --> 00:34:06.744
H-T-T-P-slash-slash.

631
00:34:06.827 --> 00:34:10.867
You... you don't have
to type the "http" part.

632
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.285
Uh. give it here. old man.

633
00:34:13.368 --> 00:34:17.408
-W-W-W...
-You don't have to type that either.

634
00:34:17.491 --> 00:34:18.838
Here. I got it.

635
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:23.321
Okay. so this is tech
billionaire Sebastian Steed.

636
00:34:23.404 --> 00:34:26.457
-goes by "Bash."
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.

637
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.389
That's what I told you. The
guy who invented the thing.

638
00:34:31.472 --> 00:34:34.614
Okay. so the other
guy is Jay Pflug.

639
00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:37.571
Heir of the Pflug pharma family.

640
00:34:37.654 --> 00:34:40.797
Oh. they make highly
addictive drugs

641
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.022
that ruined a lot
of people's lives.

642
00:34:44.105 --> 00:34:49.672
They also make my blood pressure
medication. so I'm conflicted.

643
00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:51.641
This is Camila White.

644
00:34:51.724 --> 00:34:54.777
She owns half of
New York's hotels.

645
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.452
And God. can she rock
a neutral cashmere.

646
00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:03.742
She's like the human incarnation
of a Nancy Meyers kitchen.

647
00:35:03.825 --> 00:35:07.058
Guys. guys. they're
all billionaires.

648
00:35:07.141 --> 00:35:11.720
This isn't the mob. this
is the new mob of New York.

649
00:35:11.803 --> 00:35:15.215
Please tell me you
recorded that. Okay.

650
00:35:15.298 --> 00:35:18.621
-I need a drink.
-Let's check the bar.

651
00:35:18.704 --> 00:35:20.769
As the city has changed.

652
00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:23.276
so too have those in power.

653
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:27.759
The "mafia." as we once
knew them. may be no more.

654
00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:30.267
but the idea of many losing

655
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:35.468
in order for an elite few to
win has never been more true.

656
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:39.681
Gone are the velour
tracksuits and gold chains.

657
00:35:39.764 --> 00:35:43.266
replaced now by boat
shoes and Dogecoin.
