[low. indistinct chatter]

[men laughing]

4
00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:34.144
Murphy. join t' party. huh?

5
00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.025
What's wrong?

6
00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:42.235
All you guys having a good time?

7
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.904
You gotta let it go. man.
There's good that came out of this.

8
00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:47.866
Yeah. we used him.
then we got him killed.

9
00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.702
No. we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

10
00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:53.163
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

11
00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.457
- Look on the bright side. huh?
- [slaps Steve's back]

12
00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:01.380
[Steve] Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

13
00:01:02.588 --> 00:01:05.884
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

14
00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:08.303
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

15
00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:14.684
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

16
00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:18.355
Finally. the Colombian government
had to react.

17
00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:22.483
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

18
00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.403
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100.000 REWARD

19
00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:29.657
Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

20
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.412
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

21
00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.914
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US.

22
00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:38.499
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

23
00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.836
This made all the difference in the world.

24
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.839
- [Latin music plays nearby]
- If you were a narco in Colombia.

25
00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:47.759
jail time meant banging girls.
watching movies.

26
00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:49.552
hanging with the fellas...

27
00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:53.639
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

28
00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:55.558
It was a fucking joke.

29
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:58.144
Back home.
it was a whole different deal.

30
00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:02.023
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

31
00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:06.403
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day.
just like every other loser.

32
00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:08.029
a fucking nightmare.

33
00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:11.950
Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.

34
00:02:13.368 --> 00:02:16.329
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

35
00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.669
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

36
00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:49.297
- With our help. you will.
- Oh. that's right.

37
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.882
Gringos to the rescue.

38
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.719
[dry chuckle] It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

39
00:03:54.927 --> 00:03:59.265
One man with helicopters. airplanes.
vehicles. planned escape routes.

40
00:03:59.474 --> 00:04:02.101
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money.

41
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.604
- men. weapons--
- You make it sound so easy.

42
00:04:05.397 --> 00:04:08.733
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

43
00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.236
Help us catch him.

44
00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:15.323
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

45
00:04:15.407 --> 00:04:16.991
Let me take care of that.

46
00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:21.954
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

47
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.547
Escobar will not go lightly.

48
00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:36.010
He will make Colombia bleed.

49
00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:42.642
[in Spanish] Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

50
00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.313
You make the mistakes.
and then you preach solidarity?

51
00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:49.732
- Shut up. fag.
- What the fuck. Carlos?

52
00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:52.902
Why are you always defending him?

53
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:54.946
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

54
00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:58.824
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

55
00:05:03.413 --> 00:05:04.789
Gentlemen...

56
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.919
I suggest we form another organization

57
00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:13.423
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

58
00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:15.716
Like John Lennon said.

59
00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:19.262
- "Come together. brothers and sisters--"
- Stop that fag shit right now.

60
00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:22.474
So Jorge...

61
00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:24.601
what will we call it?

62
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.938
[Steve] First. "Death to Kidnappers."
then "the Extraditables."

63
00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:34.360
Once again. the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.

64
00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:38.072
But it was not quite like
"one for all. and all for one."

65
00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:42.827
It was more like each man for himself.

66
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.329
[in Spanish] Next!

67
00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:48.541
Gacha. being Gacha. decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

68
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.671
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- [man] Fire!

69
00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:56.007
[Steve] So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

70
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.924
Next!

71
00:05:57.133 --> 00:06:00.886
Lehder. being Lehder. got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

72
00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:04.349
[in Spanish] The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

73
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.811
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

74
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.022
[Steve]
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

75
00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:13.941
[Carlos] I mean. all of our problems...

76
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.321
are because of those imperialist gringos!

77
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.948
[sniffs] No. stay there... stay there.

78
00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:24.994
[Steve] As for the Ochoa brothers.
they went with a fancy PR firm

79
00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:28.623
and got ripped off because. well...
that's what PR agencies do.

80
00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:30.833
[in Spanish]
"Better a grave in Colombia

81
00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:32.377
than a grave in the United States."

82
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.422
No. I've got it. Fabio. I've got it.
Let's see...

83
00:06:36.631 --> 00:06:41.052
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

84
00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.595
- What do you think?
- I love it.

85
00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:45.014
- [Jorge chuckling]
- Very good.

86
00:06:45.097 --> 00:06:48.518
And for $50.000 more.
we'll make your logo.

87
00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:50.603
Done.

88
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.693
[Steve] By the way.
here's the logo $50.000 got you.

89
00:06:56.776 --> 00:07:00.446
In the upcoming presidential election.
extradition became the defining issue

90
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.864
amongst the candidates.

91
00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.534
Those the narcos could buy.
they bought.

92
00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.827
The ones they could scare.
they scared.

93
00:07:07.036 --> 00:07:09.789
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

94
00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:13.876
And so. unable to buy him
and unable to scare him.

95
00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:17.171
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery.

96
00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:19.173
and he wrote Galán a letter.

97
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.970
[in English] "And to conclude. I want
to express my most energetic protest

98
00:07:25.054 --> 00:07:27.766
over the improper interference
of North America

99
00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:30.727
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

100
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.853
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

101
00:07:33.772 --> 00:07:35.565
He's got some balls.

102
00:07:35.774 --> 00:07:37.358
Escobar is shameless.

103
00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:42.029
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency. Mr. Galán.

104
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:45.157
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States.

105
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:48.119
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

106
00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:51.080
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

107
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:54.041
My campaign manager.
Dr. Gaviria.

108
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.586
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

109
00:07:57.462 --> 00:08:00.673
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle.

110
00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:03.468
when clearly.
they're losing a war.

111
00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.512
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

112
00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:11.892
[in Spanish] If you speak in favor
of extradition. you will be their puppet.

113
00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:14.312
and that will be your death sentence.

114
00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:18.650
I don't care about the Americans. but I am
still going to support extradition.

115
00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:21.986
Besides. if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country.

116
00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.404
then let them take them.

117
00:08:23.488 --> 00:08:24.989
[Steve]
Since he couldn't get to Galán.

118
00:08:25.197 --> 00:08:27.826
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

119
00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:30.745
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

120
00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:32.955
if no judge was willing to apply it.

121
00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:37.627
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

122
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.963
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States.

123
00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:44.425
know we. the Extraditables.
will pass judgment on you

124
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.094
and bring a sentence far harsher."

125
00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:49.472
The judges were so scared and intimidated

126
00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:52.308
that special court procedures
had to be created.

127
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:54.853
For the first time
in the history of Colombia.

128
00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:57.814
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

129
00:08:58.022 --> 00:08:59.649
[in Spanish] Defendants. please rise.

130
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.196
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

131
00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:12.203
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

132
00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.623
[Steve] Despite his threats.
many brave men defied him.

133
00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:21.253
And true to form.
when the pen failed...

134
00:09:21.337 --> 00:09:23.339
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

135
00:09:23.422 --> 00:09:24.465
[engine starts]

136
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:32.348
In light of this terrorism.
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

137
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:36.268
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority. right?

138
00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:37.770
Well. guess again.

139
00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:41.733
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

140
00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:45.444
All due respect. but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

141
00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:49.240
We got FARC. we got M-19.
we got EPL. we got ELN.

142
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:51.868
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

143
00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:55.705
Sorry. Agent Peña. but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems.

144
00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:58.082
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

145
00:09:59.124 --> 00:10:02.086
[Steve]
Communists. Remember them?

146
00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:06.591
With Reagan in the White House.
it was hard to forget.

147
00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:07.717
In his words:

148
00:10:07.926 --> 00:10:10.929
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

149
00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:15.307
[Steve] The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing. always had been.

150
00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:18.937
In Hollywood. he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

151
00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:22.022
In Washington.
he created the Reagan Doctrine.

152
00:10:22.106 --> 00:10:24.776
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

153
00:10:25.902 --> 00:10:28.320
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

154
00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:31.991
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world.

155
00:10:32.074 --> 00:10:33.242
you'd better be chasing reds.

156
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:36.829
Ambassador. if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets.

157
00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:38.873
the Colombians will get Escobar.

158
00:10:38.957 --> 00:10:42.001
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

159
00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:44.712
- and saving thousands of lives--
- Ambassador.

160
00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:49.884
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

161
00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:53.220
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker. and as such.

162
00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:58.267
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

163
00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:03.522
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

164
00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:05.232
Let the Colombians get him.

165
00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:09.403
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100.000

166
00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:12.657
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah. it's a fucking joke.

167
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.492
That's about what he spends on shoes.
isn't it?

168
00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:17.662
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

169
00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:19.163
So what do we do now?

170
00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.749
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

171
00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:26.420
[Steve] It's true.
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

172
00:11:26.504 --> 00:11:29.256
But delivered into the right hands.
it could make a difference.

173
00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:34.094
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia.
honorable men.

174
00:11:34.178 --> 00:11:39.058
But the head of counternarcotics.
General Jaramillo. wasn't one of 'em.

175
00:11:41.226 --> 00:11:44.271
And as such.
he was exactly what we needed.

176
00:11:45.064 --> 00:11:47.025
[in Spanish]
Thank you for seeing me. General.

177
00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:48.734
You're welcome.

178
00:11:48.818 --> 00:11:52.404
Listen. I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

179
00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:56.868
With all due respect. General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

180
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:00.120
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

181
00:12:00.204 --> 00:12:02.040
Well. I don't want him to follow.

182
00:12:02.874 --> 00:12:04.542
I want him to lead.

183
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:11.632
Go ahead.

184
00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:14.844
Yes. General.

185
00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:17.055
As you wish.

186
00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:18.305
Understood.

187
00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.519
What happened. honey?

188
00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:25.396
Things with work.

189
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.690
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

190
00:12:27.773 --> 00:12:31.652
I'm making the chicken he likes.
but he's out with the girlfriend.

191
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.741
Tell me what's wrong.

192
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:39.660
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

193
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.084
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

194
00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:50.088
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man.

195
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.840
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

196
00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:54.967
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

197
00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:57.053
[Pablo] Hm.

198
00:12:58.054 --> 00:13:01.557
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back. well. then...

199
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.559
I didn't hear them complaining. did I?

200
00:13:03.642 --> 00:13:06.311
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

201
00:13:06.395 --> 00:13:09.231
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

202
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.152
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police. you know?

203
00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:14.528
And most of all. to the top brass.

204
00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:17.489
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

205
00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:18.657
[Gustavo] Mm.

206
00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:24.622
Oh. shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

207
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.416
- [birds squawking]
- [Pablo] Egrets from the Himalayas.

208
00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:28.459
[Gustavo chuckles]

209
00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:31.003
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

210
00:13:31.837 --> 00:13:34.173
They cost me a million dollars.

211
00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:41.097
[sighs]

212
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.431
Bastards.

213
00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:46.144
Stay in the fucking tree!

214
00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:50.940
[Gustavo laughs]

215
00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:58.739
Seems like you lost that dough.
eh. cousin?

216
00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:02.910
That's your problem. Pablo.

217
00:14:02.994 --> 00:14:05.496
You think that everything
can be controlled.

218
00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:08.082
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

219
00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:14.005
OK. OK. OK. Gustavo... OK. [sighs]

220
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.383
[in English] Your English is really good.

221
00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:21.595
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

222
00:14:21.804 --> 00:14:23.305
How long you been at the comuna?

223
00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:25.474
Just a few weeks.

224
00:14:25.557 --> 00:14:28.102
Is your husband
gonna help us here. too?

225
00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:31.522
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

226
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.360
Oh. he's. uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

227
00:14:38.154 --> 00:14:40.990
[up-tempo Latin music plays]

228
00:14:42.158 --> 00:14:44.576
- I fucked up.
- How?

229
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.204
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

230
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:48.413
No. Jaramillo's sending a message.

231
00:14:50.875 --> 00:14:53.169
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

232
00:14:53.252 --> 00:14:55.796
He's setting Carrillo up for failure.
and when he does fail.

233
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.215
he'll fire him for incompetence.

234
00:14:57.256 --> 00:15:00.092
and me and you.
we lose the only cop we can trust.

235
00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.553
[women chuckling]

236
00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:03.971
- Hey!
- Hey!

237
00:15:04.055 --> 00:15:05.764
- Sorry I'm late. honey.
- Mm...

238
00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:09.309
Javier. this is my friend. Elisa.

239
00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:11.187
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

240
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.312
Nice to meet you.

241
00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:16.817
Are you another... janitor at the embassy.
like Steve?

242
00:15:16.901 --> 00:15:18.986
No. actually. I'm CIA.

243
00:15:19.195 --> 00:15:22.489
But that's classified.
so don't tell anybody.

244
00:15:22.573 --> 00:15:26.118
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

245
00:15:26.202 --> 00:15:28.913
- The janitor thing. what. that was you?
- Mm.

246
00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:31.165
No. it's just a cover.

247
00:15:31.249 --> 00:15:33.667
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

248
00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:36.712
Just so you know.
I'm a communist guerrillera.

249
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:38.839
[all chuckling]

250
00:15:38.923 --> 00:15:40.007
Perfect.

251
00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:42.676
[Steve] If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

252
00:15:43.468 --> 00:15:45.304
we probably wouldn't have cared.

253
00:15:45.387 --> 00:15:47.681
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

254
00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:50.851
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

255
00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:53.979
He had better resources
and better information.

256
00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:56.523
And at the time.
he owned over 800 homes and fincas.

257
00:15:56.732 --> 00:15:59.610
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

258
00:15:59.818 --> 00:16:03.281
And cops...
he owned a lot of them. too.

259
00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:04.531
But not all of them.

260
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.078
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

261
00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:11.705
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

262
00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:14.041
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

263
00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:17.753
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

264
00:16:20.672 --> 00:16:22.382
Trapped a little bird.

265
00:16:23.508 --> 00:16:25.094
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

266
00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:27.221
Jesus.

267
00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:35.146
Just remember that you wanted all in.

268
00:16:35.354 --> 00:16:37.231
[Carrillo in Spanish]
Hand me that coffee.

269
00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:39.608
[man speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

270
00:16:41.485 --> 00:16:42.611
[soft gasp]

271
00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:44.989
[cup clatters]

272
00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.116
[man gasps sharply. coughs]

273
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:51.495
[in English] He already gave up
the name of three fincas.

274
00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.831
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

275
00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:57.960
[in Spanish] But you do know
where he is hiding. don't you?

276
00:17:18.897 --> 00:17:21.066
[in Spanish] Look. little brother.

277
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.403
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

278
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.324
But I will also kill you.

279
00:17:29.158 --> 00:17:30.492
And very slowly.

280
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:34.705
[stammers weakly]
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

281
00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:39.418
Well. then. you should pray we find him.
and quickly.

282
00:17:42.004 --> 00:17:45.299
[Steve] We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out.

283
00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:48.927
but there was a small part of me
that thought. in his arrogance.

284
00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.138
he would stand and fight.

285
00:17:51.222 --> 00:17:53.682
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

286
00:17:53.765 --> 00:17:55.642
[in Spanish] Boss!

287
00:17:55.726 --> 00:17:56.727
Poison...

288
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.103
Boss!

289
00:17:59.355 --> 00:18:02.358
They were headed for El Bizcocho.
but they got off the main highway.

290
00:18:02.441 --> 00:18:05.194
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

291
00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:06.528
Two hours. boss.

292
00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:10.074
Round up the guys.
and tell them to get ready.

293
00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:12.076
- We're leaving.
- All right.

294
00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:17.164
We have to go.

295
00:18:18.082 --> 00:18:19.458
Go where?

296
00:18:19.541 --> 00:18:21.252
The police are coming.

297
00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:23.587
- But Pablo. I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry. my love.

298
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.549
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

299
00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:29.509
We'll buy new ones later.
won't we?

300
00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:31.970
[Pablo sighs]

301
00:18:33.513 --> 00:18:34.639
[softly] I'm sorry.

302
00:18:35.807 --> 00:18:37.476
Do you hear me complaining?

303
00:18:40.187 --> 00:18:45.525
As long as you're with us. Pablo.
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

304
00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.537
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- [man] Yes. sir.

305
00:18:57.621 --> 00:18:58.956
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

306
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.209
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

307
00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:03.585
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

308
00:19:03.668 --> 00:19:06.130
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

309
00:19:09.674 --> 00:19:12.761
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

310
00:19:12.844 --> 00:19:14.513
[man] Yes. sir!

311
00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:16.598
[men chatter in Spanish]

312
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:33.407
What's wrong. Gustavo?

313
00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:36.868
You fucked us. Pablo.

314
00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:40.498
Not only you and me.

315
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.207
You fucked the whole family.

316
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.923
But of course. since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

317
00:19:51.967 --> 00:19:54.678
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country.

318
00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:57.097
the rest of us get screwed.
isn't that right?

319
00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:04.771
But what the fuck...

320
00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:08.608
a man only dies once. right?

321
00:20:11.653 --> 00:20:12.988
[softly] Come here.

322
00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:21.163
[whispers] My brother.

323
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.791
[Pablo] I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on. come on.

324
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:28.962
- [engine powering]
- There we go.

325
00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:42.100
[Steve] I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

326
00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.644
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time.

327
00:20:44.728 --> 00:20:49.107
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

328
00:20:49.191 --> 00:20:53.278
You may have 800 houses. my friend.
but none of them is home.

329
00:20:53.362 --> 00:20:56.448
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life.

330
00:20:56.532 --> 00:20:59.493
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

331
00:20:59.577 --> 00:21:02.079
From now on.
nowhere is safe.

332
00:21:02.287 --> 00:21:04.789
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

333
00:21:21.098 --> 00:21:23.517
[Steve] The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

334
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:25.936
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

335
00:21:27.563 --> 00:21:31.233
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

336
00:21:31.442 --> 00:21:36.029
Hey. if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out. too.

337
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:40.033
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

338
00:21:40.117 --> 00:21:42.911
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

339
00:21:42.994 --> 00:21:45.497
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

340
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.670
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit.
I got very lucky.

341
00:21:52.337 --> 00:21:56.467
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

342
00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.303
We raided it.
and guess who we found?

343
00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.555
Blackbeard.

344
00:22:01.639 --> 00:22:05.016
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

345
00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:08.604
In custody.
he would describe a cocaine empire

346
00:22:08.687 --> 00:22:12.524
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

347
00:22:12.608 --> 00:22:15.402
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

348
00:22:15.486 --> 00:22:19.823
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice.

349
00:22:19.906 --> 00:22:22.117
home of Colombia's supreme court.

350
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.744
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

351
00:22:26.288 --> 00:22:30.542
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

352
00:22:30.626 --> 00:22:32.002
[whispers in Spanish] Fuck.

353
00:22:34.546 --> 00:22:35.797
[whispers in English] Fuck.

354
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.924
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

355
00:22:38.008 --> 00:22:40.177
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

356
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.596
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

357
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.806
Javi. there's some good stuff in here.
stuff we can use.

358
00:22:44.889 --> 00:22:47.058
[Javier]
None of it can leave the room.

359
00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:49.936
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

360
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.856
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

361
00:22:53.106 --> 00:22:55.609
[Steve]
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

362
00:23:01.657 --> 00:23:02.824
Take 'em.

363
00:23:04.284 --> 00:23:06.995
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

364
00:23:07.078 --> 00:23:09.039
What are you talking about?

365
00:23:09.122 --> 00:23:11.583
[whispers] Do you want to catch Pablo
or not? [clears throat]

366
00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:17.422
- [softly] Why me?
- [whispers] Because they'll suspect me.

367
00:23:17.506 --> 00:23:19.966
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

368
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.760
They're not gonna
search a white boy. OK?

369
00:23:21.843 --> 00:23:24.095
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

370
00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:25.263
Just do it.

371
00:23:27.224 --> 00:23:29.893
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

372
00:23:31.186 --> 00:23:33.021
- [Steve] And sometimes. bad people...
- Señor.

373
00:23:33.104 --> 00:23:34.356
...help you do good things.

374
00:23:35.357 --> 00:23:37.984
[Javier in Spanish] These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

375
00:23:38.068 --> 00:23:42.113
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

376
00:23:43.699 --> 00:23:44.658
Yes.

377
00:23:45.701 --> 00:23:49.788
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

378
00:23:49.871 --> 00:23:51.373
Obviously. it's an alias.

379
00:23:51.456 --> 00:23:55.377
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle." [soft chuckle]

380
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.713
Because he's not Colombian.

381
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:03.301
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

382
00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:05.136
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

383
00:24:06.012 --> 00:24:09.307
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

384
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:13.937
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

385
00:24:16.523 --> 00:24:19.067
Suarez. do you ever worry
what will happen to you

386
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.446
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

387
00:24:23.447 --> 00:24:26.157
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

388
00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:29.869
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

389
00:24:29.953 --> 00:24:31.663
[sighs]

390
00:24:31.747 --> 00:24:35.751
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

391
00:24:35.834 --> 00:24:39.713
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

392
00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:45.051
[chats indistinctly in Spanish. chuckles]

393
00:24:46.094 --> 00:24:48.179
Wha-- What the fuck is this?

394
00:24:48.263 --> 00:24:49.889
This is me giving you homework.

395
00:24:50.098 --> 00:24:52.350
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

396
00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:54.185
And I need you to find out who it is.

397
00:24:54.394 --> 00:24:57.147
First off. I don't fucking work for you.
Murphy. you hear me?

398
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.108
- So don't come in here thinking that--
- Is that Barry Seal?

399
00:25:02.694 --> 00:25:04.655
What's he up to these days?

400
00:25:04.738 --> 00:25:06.030
Barry Seal.

401
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.416
[Steve] Barry Seal. a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football.

402
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.169
mind-altering chemicals.
and pussy...

403
00:25:19.377 --> 00:25:21.797
which made him perfect CIA material.

404
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.092
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

405
00:25:26.968 --> 00:25:28.887
Finding Barry was easy.

406
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.056
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

407
00:25:32.265 --> 00:25:34.601
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite. too.

408
00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:37.270
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

409
00:25:37.354 --> 00:25:38.772
[laughing]

410
00:25:39.564 --> 00:25:40.691
No. I'm serious.

411
00:25:41.692 --> 00:25:43.067
[Steve]
Look.

412
00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:46.363
[Javier] Oh. my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

413
00:25:46.571 --> 00:25:47.906
[in Spanish] Until next time.

414
00:25:51.284 --> 00:25:54.412
- [in English] Goddamn. is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

415
00:25:55.664 --> 00:25:57.916
Come on. we got you a ride
waiting over here.

416
00:25:57.999 --> 00:25:59.668
[in Spanish] Hi. Vanessa.

417
00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:03.380
[in English] It's fun to say. though.
ain't it? "McPickle"?

418
00:26:05.006 --> 00:26:07.091
[Javier clears throat]

419
00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:09.803
Have a seat. Barry.

420
00:26:14.432 --> 00:26:18.520
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

421
00:26:18.603 --> 00:26:21.314
- Well. you guys ain't got shit.
- [Javier chuckles]

422
00:26:21.398 --> 00:26:26.152
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

423
00:26:26.236 --> 00:26:28.238
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

424
00:26:28.321 --> 00:26:33.034
Yeah? Well. let's see
if that holds up in court. huh?

425
00:26:33.243 --> 00:26:36.830
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

426
00:26:36.914 --> 00:26:38.623
without making a refueling stop.

427
00:26:38.832 --> 00:26:42.043
Yeah. according to the records.
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

428
00:26:43.378 --> 00:26:44.671
The manifests don't lie.

429
00:26:44.755 --> 00:26:48.884
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine.

430
00:26:48.967 --> 00:26:52.637
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department. wouldn't it?

431
00:26:52.721 --> 00:26:56.600
Well. damn... [chuckles]
you guys are good.

432
00:26:56.683 --> 00:26:58.017
Communist sympathizer.

433
00:26:58.101 --> 00:27:00.103
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big. red bow

434
00:27:00.311 --> 00:27:01.980
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

435
00:27:02.063 --> 00:27:04.566
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments.

436
00:27:04.649 --> 00:27:07.193
that's treason and trafficking.

437
00:27:07.402 --> 00:27:09.654
What's that.
two life sentences for the price of one?

438
00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:11.865
[Javier] That's right.

439
00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:18.997
Well... see.
I figured this day might come.

440
00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:22.125
Why don't you uncuff me. boys.
I got something to show you.

441
00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:23.334
Yeah? What's that?

442
00:27:23.418 --> 00:27:26.129
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

443
00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:29.591
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on. uncuff me.

444
00:27:29.674 --> 00:27:32.176
[Steve]
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

445
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.222
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

446
00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:40.351
'Cause at the time. Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas.

447
00:27:40.435 --> 00:27:43.229
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

448
00:27:43.313 --> 00:27:46.024
for cocaine shipments to the US.

449
00:27:46.107 --> 00:27:50.153
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

450
00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:51.571
I couldn't have made that up.

451
00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:53.531
- [Javier] Holy shit.
- [Steve] It was too good.

452
00:27:53.615 --> 00:27:56.409
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait. wait. wait. No.

453
00:27:56.493 --> 00:27:59.245
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

454
00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:02.791
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

455
00:28:02.874 --> 00:28:05.043
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

456
00:28:05.126 --> 00:28:08.588
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

457
00:28:08.672 --> 00:28:10.924
- You know. I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

458
00:28:11.008 --> 00:28:14.511
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

459
00:28:23.895 --> 00:28:27.148
[Steve] I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants.

460
00:28:27.231 --> 00:28:30.318
but frankly.
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

461
00:28:30.401 --> 00:28:32.278
He was just another busted trafficker

462
00:28:32.362 --> 00:28:35.949
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

463
00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:39.661
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

464
00:28:39.744 --> 00:28:42.914
to get the resources we needed.
then fuck him.

465
00:28:43.122 --> 00:28:45.333
Strange bedfellows. indeed.

466
00:28:45.416 --> 00:28:49.170
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

467
00:28:49.379 --> 00:28:51.339
Washington is gonna go crazy.

468
00:28:52.173 --> 00:28:53.842
Thank you. Ambassador.

469
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:58.262
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

470
00:28:58.346 --> 00:28:59.472
Of course.

471
00:29:01.808 --> 00:29:02.767
Thank you.

472
00:29:05.186 --> 00:29:09.774
[Steve] In Washington. "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

473
00:29:09.983 --> 00:29:13.862
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

474
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:16.865
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

475
00:29:16.948 --> 00:29:21.369
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

476
00:29:21.452 --> 00:29:24.622
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

477
00:29:24.706 --> 00:29:27.959
This picture shows Federico Vaughan.

478
00:29:28.043 --> 00:29:31.880
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua.

479
00:29:31.963 --> 00:29:36.927
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

480
00:29:38.011 --> 00:29:42.223
No. there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

481
00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:45.560
[Steve]
Being a rat is a dangerous business.

482
00:29:45.643 --> 00:29:47.771
and Escobar's reach was long.

483
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:50.481
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

484
00:29:50.565 --> 00:29:52.567
- [automatic gunfire]
- [grunts]

485
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.695
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

486
00:29:55.904 --> 00:29:57.196
Whoops.

487
00:30:04.162 --> 00:30:06.706
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

488
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.918
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña. if he wanted a long life.

489
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:12.754
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

490
00:30:12.963 --> 00:30:15.590
I didn't kill him. Escobar did.

491
00:30:16.507 --> 00:30:18.885
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

492
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:21.138
Look on the bright side. man.

493
00:30:23.014 --> 00:30:25.100
[Steve]
From then on. according to Reagan.

494
00:30:25.183 --> 00:30:28.645
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

495
00:30:28.728 --> 00:30:32.356
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

496
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.401
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

497
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.906
planes. helicopters.
you fucking name it. Everything.

498
00:30:44.786 --> 00:30:49.124
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

499
00:30:49.207 --> 00:30:53.753
and burn 'em straight to the ground.
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

500
00:30:53.962 --> 00:30:56.881
We were kicking ass.
and the narcos were feeling it.

501
00:30:57.632 --> 00:31:00.426
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

502
00:31:00.635 --> 00:31:04.806
Despite all this. we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

503
00:31:04.889 --> 00:31:08.601
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether.

504
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.436
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

505
00:31:10.645 --> 00:31:11.562
Got it!

506
00:31:13.064 --> 00:31:15.817
[Steve] The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia.

507
00:31:16.026 --> 00:31:19.362
Medellín's biggest processing lab.
and we hit it hard.

508
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.782
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

509
00:31:22.866 --> 00:31:25.618
but in the end.
it got us our biggest victory to date.

510
00:31:25.702 --> 00:31:29.998
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

511
00:31:30.207 --> 00:31:33.168
[in English]
In my tent is a bag with $50.000...

512
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:35.253
ten times this if you give me one hour.

513
00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:39.757
[in Spanish] There's no way out.
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

514
00:31:43.136 --> 00:31:45.889
[Steve] Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States.

515
00:31:45.972 --> 00:31:51.435
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

516
00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:56.649
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

517
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:01.779
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

518
00:32:01.863 --> 00:32:05.200
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán.

519
00:32:05.283 --> 00:32:09.537
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

520
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.956
Extradition would become his battle cry.

521
00:32:12.165 --> 00:32:13.958
[man in Spanish] Gentlemen?

522
00:32:15.668 --> 00:32:17.003
Thank you.

523
00:32:18.255 --> 00:32:22.092
[Steve] And for the narcos.
this was a declaration of war.

524
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.304
[Duque in Spanish]
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

525
00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:30.600
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

526
00:32:30.683 --> 00:32:34.353
against the legality of extradition.

527
00:32:34.437 --> 00:32:39.358
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

528
00:32:39.442 --> 00:32:42.028
Can we buy someone in that court?

529
00:32:43.113 --> 00:32:45.198
Unfortunately. no.

530
00:32:45.282 --> 00:32:48.743
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

531
00:32:49.827 --> 00:32:52.830
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

532
00:32:52.914 --> 00:32:55.708
Brother... even after he's dead.

533
00:32:55.917 --> 00:32:59.170
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

534
00:32:59.254 --> 00:33:01.172
He's totally fucked.

535
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.882
This is gringo bullshit.

536
00:33:02.966 --> 00:33:06.761
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

537
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.097
We're next. aren't we?

538
00:33:09.306 --> 00:33:11.182
You're right.

539
00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:13.184
Pablito?

540
00:33:13.268 --> 00:33:14.769
Do you have an answer or what?

541
00:33:18.856 --> 00:33:24.403
Well... in my opinion. a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

542
00:33:25.155 --> 00:33:28.658
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

543
00:33:28.741 --> 00:33:31.328
Carlos was one of us.

544
00:33:33.037 --> 00:33:38.209
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

545
00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:40.544
But remember.
there's something they want more than us.

546
00:33:40.628 --> 00:33:43.756
So. brothers...

547
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:46.843
it's time to give them what they want.
isn't it?

548
00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:47.969
[murmurs of approval]

549
00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:51.722
[Ivan in Spanish] I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

550
00:33:51.806 --> 00:33:55.101
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

551
00:33:55.185 --> 00:33:59.563
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

552
00:33:59.647 --> 00:34:04.944
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

553
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.739
Two million US dollars.

554
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.450
It's very dangerous.

555
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.414
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

556
00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:21.336
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous. right?

557
00:34:28.926 --> 00:34:30.511
[knocking at door]

558
00:34:32.222 --> 00:34:34.098
[Pablo] But for us. brother...

559
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:38.686
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

560
00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:43.400
We have an historical obligation.

561
00:34:44.901 --> 00:34:47.362
- We can't forget that.
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

562
00:34:47.445 --> 00:34:49.072
[Elisa] I'm his girlfriend.

563
00:34:56.662 --> 00:34:58.248
Meet Pablo Escobar.

564
00:35:01.042 --> 00:35:02.335
Miss.

565
00:35:03.378 --> 00:35:05.088
- OK.
- We have a deal.

566
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:06.589
All right. then.

567
00:35:07.424 --> 00:35:09.842
We were just leaving.

568
00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:11.261
Good night.

569
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:20.895
What the hell is this?

570
00:35:20.978 --> 00:35:23.106
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

571
00:35:23.189 --> 00:35:26.901
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

572
00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:29.695
In exchange for what?

573
00:35:29.904 --> 00:35:34.325
Unless you are willing to be part of it.
I cannot say.

574
00:35:36.911 --> 00:35:41.416
It's a partnership.
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

575
00:35:41.499 --> 00:35:45.878
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

576
00:36:01.436 --> 00:36:02.812
[in English] Connie?

577
00:36:02.895 --> 00:36:04.730
Elisa? What's going on?

578
00:36:05.648 --> 00:36:07.066
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

579
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.152
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

580
00:36:09.235 --> 00:36:10.445
Yeah.

581
00:36:10.653 --> 00:36:12.280
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

582
00:36:12.363 --> 00:36:13.572
About what?

583
00:36:13.781 --> 00:36:17.743
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

584
00:36:17.952 --> 00:36:19.870
I don't know what it is.
but I know it's gonna be bad.

585
00:36:19.954 --> 00:36:22.957
Wait. Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

586
00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:26.585
I-- I just know.
You need to warn him...

587
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:28.129
and you need to hide me.

588
00:36:29.464 --> 00:36:31.048
OK. Come on.

589
00:36:34.593 --> 00:36:37.555
Steve's already at work.
but Javi lives downstairs.

590
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.898
I just hope he's here.

591
00:36:47.982 --> 00:36:49.400
[Javier] I am.

592
00:36:50.693 --> 00:36:52.945
- Well. what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

593
00:36:53.029 --> 00:36:54.531
I'll be right back. Go.

594
00:36:59.369 --> 00:37:01.204
- [Connie] She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

595
00:37:01.287 --> 00:37:04.248
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

596
00:37:04.332 --> 00:37:06.667
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

597
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.170
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

598
00:37:09.253 --> 00:37:10.421
Escobar and M-19?

599
00:37:10.505 --> 00:37:12.798
She didn't tell me any details.
just that it would be bad.

600
00:37:12.882 --> 00:37:14.800
No... that doesn't make any sense.

601
00:37:14.884 --> 00:37:17.678
She asked me to hide her.
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

602
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:18.804
OK. All right.

603
00:37:19.763 --> 00:37:21.224
[sighs. clears throat]

604
00:37:32.193 --> 00:37:33.194
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

605
00:37:33.403 --> 00:37:36.531
Ambassador. I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're--

606
00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:39.242
- [reporter] ...supreme court building.
- Oh. my God.

607
00:37:40.493 --> 00:37:42.245
[Steve] "Oh. my God" is right.

608
00:37:42.328 --> 00:37:46.790
Financed by Escobar. the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

609
00:37:46.999 --> 00:37:49.377
and occupied the supreme court.

610
00:37:49.586 --> 00:37:52.671
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

611
00:37:52.755 --> 00:37:56.426
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

612
00:37:56.634 --> 00:37:58.177
but it was all bullshit.

613
00:37:59.178 --> 00:38:00.513
The military attacked.

614
00:38:00.721 --> 00:38:02.473
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage.

615
00:38:02.681 --> 00:38:06.018
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

616
00:38:07.186 --> 00:38:08.646
Most of the M-19 were killed.

617
00:38:08.854 --> 00:38:12.900
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

618
00:38:14.818 --> 00:38:20.283
setting fire to the room that contained
600.000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

619
00:38:21.492 --> 00:38:24.036
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

620
00:38:28.165 --> 00:38:31.628
In the United States.
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

621
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.712
so they can't testify in court.

622
00:38:35.131 --> 00:38:39.176
In Colombia. Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

623
00:38:41.762 --> 00:38:45.516
[reporter] The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

624
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.144
as cannon shells exploded inside.

625
00:38:48.936 --> 00:38:50.354
[loud knock at door]

626
00:38:52.148 --> 00:38:53.732
[pounding at door]

627
00:38:55.067 --> 00:38:57.487
- Where is she?
- Well. come on in.

628
00:38:57.695 --> 00:39:00.906
You. up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

629
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.283
Put the gun away.

630
00:39:03.242 --> 00:39:04.452
Put it away.

631
00:39:05.662 --> 00:39:07.664
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

632
00:39:07.746 --> 00:39:09.915
- Can I say something?
- No. you may not.

633
00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:13.544
Murphy... calm down.

634
00:39:14.795 --> 00:39:17.256
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

635
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.509
Your wife brought her to me.

636
00:39:21.218 --> 00:39:23.929
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife. I truly do.

637
00:39:24.013 --> 00:39:26.056
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

638
00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.059
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

639
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:35.316
If she can tie Escobar to the siege.
I say we bring her in.

640
00:39:35.399 --> 00:39:36.984
Well. she's M-19.

641
00:39:37.067 --> 00:39:39.445
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

642
00:39:39.529 --> 00:39:40.779
and then she gets disappeared.

643
00:39:40.863 --> 00:39:43.115
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

644
00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:45.326
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

645
00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:47.745
Look. all she did was warn us.

646
00:39:47.828 --> 00:39:50.289
She's not on anybody's radar.

647
00:39:50.373 --> 00:39:52.458
She's not involved in anything.

648
00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:00.466
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

649
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.968
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

650
00:40:03.177 --> 00:40:07.097
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

651
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:09.808
Folks. this is more complicated
than what it seems.

652
00:40:09.892 --> 00:40:13.396
This was Escobar. classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

653
00:40:14.689 --> 00:40:17.233
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

654
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:20.444
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

655
00:40:20.653 --> 00:40:22.863
He doesn't hold grudges.
not if it suits his purposes.

656
00:40:22.946 --> 00:40:26.867
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

657
00:40:27.076 --> 00:40:29.495
You willing to identify this informant.
Agent Peña?

658
00:40:29.579 --> 00:40:33.290
- No. I am not.
- Needless to say...

659
00:40:33.374 --> 00:40:36.960
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

660
00:40:37.044 --> 00:40:39.171
in light of this communist aggression.

661
00:40:39.255 --> 00:40:41.131
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

662
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.176
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

663
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.732
[low murmurs in Spanish]

664
00:41:04.113 --> 00:41:07.491
[in Spanish]
They're looking for us everywhere.

665
00:41:07.575 --> 00:41:09.535
What did you expect?

666
00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:11.579
That it would be any different?

667
00:41:15.082 --> 00:41:18.127
You did a very good job.

668
00:41:31.808 --> 00:41:35.394
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

669
00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:38.648
No. brother.
The truth is. you helped mine.

670
00:41:41.818 --> 00:41:43.360
You. Ivan...

671
00:41:44.445 --> 00:41:47.698
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

672
00:41:49.492 --> 00:41:52.244
The same one that freed this country.

673
00:41:58.083 --> 00:41:59.836
Now it belongs to you.

674
00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:09.762
With it. you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

675
00:42:12.973 --> 00:42:15.934
I promise you.
I will continue the fight.

676
00:42:16.143 --> 00:42:18.103
You earned it. brother.

677
00:42:19.605 --> 00:42:21.398
As for me...

678
00:42:22.733 --> 00:42:24.735
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

679
00:42:25.778 --> 00:42:27.279
We are also--

680
00:42:31.659 --> 00:42:33.786
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

681
00:42:35.538 --> 00:42:37.164
And the fucking sword.
