2
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.098
Stop! Stop it!

3
00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.086
Help me!

4
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.058
Please. help me! Stop it!

5
00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:10.094
Kahina! I'm closing!

6
00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.077
How much longer?
- Where to?

7
00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:29.070
Belleville.
- I won't take you there. it's too far!

8
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.073
Isn't that in Paris?
- Yes it is...

9
00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:37.022
...but it's way across town and
I've been driving since Marseille.

10
00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:48.078
What time tomorrow?
- I'm on a two weeks vacation.

11
00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.050
Two weeks?
- That's right.

12
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.022
Where are you going?
- To bed.

13
00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:56.058
Sleep tight then.

14
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.070
Lucky bitch!

15
00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:08.054
Is this it?
- Yes. can't go further.

16
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:12.078
Get out. come on... out!

17
00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:20.047
Easy with the door!
Goodbye.

18
00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:06.046
Have you called your boss?
- I called you first.

19
00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:10.557
Who found him?

20
00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.078
A reindeer farmer.

21
00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:16.098
I got his details.

22
00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.074
Have you classified it confidential?

23
00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:24.054
The moment I got the call.

24
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.026
The pilot?

25
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:32.066
We got a second set of prints.

26
00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:34.066
It's probably the pilot.

27
00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:39.094
I see you were looking for the rest of it.

28
00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:44.022
Over there it's a piece of the head.

29
00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:48.050
We need a tent. to save it for forensics.

30
00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:51.020
We don't have tents this large.

31
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.042
Are you ok?

32
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.009
Just something I ate.

33
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.507
Hi. it's Burlin.
Yes. all good.

34
00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:11.006
A couple of miles north of Kiruna.

35
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.073
It's hard to say.

36
00:05:13.074 --> 00:05:18.030
If I'm leading this I'm gonna need
some good assistant.

37
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:22.002
I was thinking of Ulrika.

38
00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:25.058
Finland? Ah. right... shit!

39
00:05:27.052 --> 00:05:29.090
Anders Harnesk?

40
00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.014
Ok. send him here as soon as possible.

41
00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:37.014
Ok. thanks.

42
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.022
What the hell are you doing?

43
00:05:53.038 --> 00:05:56.017
Well... it was open...

44
00:05:56.018 --> 00:06:01.098
Get out of here or I'll call the police.
- Ok... the thing is...

45
00:06:02.082 --> 00:06:05.027
Tomorrow it's Midsummer's...

46
00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:09.009
I promised my daughter she could throw a party.

47
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.086
When she don't get what she wants
she gets a bit difficult to handle...

48
00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:18.038
To her this party is very important.

49
00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:24.018
My kitchen broke and all shops are closed...

50
00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.010
Wait... this is not a general store.

51
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.041
How much...
- 1000.

52
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:36.094
I don't have 1000 crowns on me!
- No problem. I'll accept cards.

53
00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:50.050
"Anders Harnesk".

54
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.054
Hi. Yes. I'm almost finished with
the report on that poaching case.

55
00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:57.063
Burlin said that?

56
00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:03.090
Ok. I'll send the report and be right there.

57
00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.034
Done.
- Good.

58
00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:17.030
What about forensics?
- Who knows when they gonna come... go up.

59
00:07:21.098 --> 00:07:28.006
What do you see?
- Suit. black shoes. white shirt.

60
00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:35.038
No rings. no wrist watch.

61
00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:37.082
Peed himself.

62
00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:40.045
Check the pockets.

63
00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:45.066
No longer a "visual inspection" then?
- Whatever.

64
00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:51.056
A paper.
- What kind?

65
00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:53.056
Gum.

66
00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:57.022
Here's something.

67
00:07:58.082 --> 00:08:01.029
Air France.

68
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:07.046
A boarding pass?
- Seat 2. Bertil. CDG.

69
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.019
CDG? What city is that?

70
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.010
"Charles de Gaulle"...

71
00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:16.010
...Paris.

72
00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:57.042
Hey. Kahina!
We're going out. are you coming?

73
00:08:57.072 --> 00:09:04.002
"You reached Kahina Zadi. I can't answer right now. please leave a message".

74
00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:27.094
Yes?

75
00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:36.078
May I speak to you?
- And you are...?

76
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.034
Can I come in?
- Excuse me?

77
00:09:41.074 --> 00:09:44.022
What is it that you want?

78
00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:47.098
Can I come in?
- No. you can't.

79
00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:49.098
Wait!

80
00:09:54.004 --> 00:09:57.022
I'm not your brother.

81
00:10:27.018 --> 00:10:34.018
Burlin here. Call forensics and Lulea homicide.
Tell them we have a name.

82
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.014
Bye.

83
00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:41.014
Hi.

84
00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:48.046
Is the head missing?
- Not all of it. We found teeth. we can get prints.

85
00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:52.038
Anders... I'll be honest with you.

86
00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:57.045
I asked for Ulrika first.
- Ulrika is good.

87
00:10:57.046 --> 00:11:04.014
Me and her worked together in the past
but now she's on a case in Finland.

88
00:11:04.015 --> 00:11:06.081
Anyway...

89
00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:11.030
...I'm happy to have you
as assistant on this case.

90
00:11:12.074 --> 00:11:17.028
We got a warrant out for the pilot?
- Soon as we know the name.

91
00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:20.033
I called but no one answered.

92
00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:27.034
What about the rest of my schedule?
I gotta be in court next week...

93
00:11:27.078 --> 00:11:34.078
Screw court! You're with me now.
we work on the field. ok?

94
00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:39.094
There's the teeth.

95
00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:47.078
What do we know about the victim?
- The guy's name seems to be Pierre Carnot.

96
00:11:47.088 --> 00:11:51.034
Air France just sent his details.

97
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:56.550
Call the French embassy.
Tell them we have one of theirs.

98
00:11:56.551 --> 00:12:02.058
Classified as homicide?
- I think there's little doubt.

99
00:12:02.068 --> 00:12:05.094
Unless you have a different theory.

100
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.026
How did you get here?

101
00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:25.058
Hitchhiked.

102
00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:29.058
How did you find me?
Who gave you the address?

103
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.046
Mom... I mean. grandma.

104
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.046
How is she?

105
00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:51.030
Fine.

106
00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:57.042
Why did she tell you...
- Who you are?

107
00:12:58.002 --> 00:13:01.018
I've been expelled from school.

108
00:13:01.078 --> 00:13:07.090
She said she can't look after me anymore.
she's too old.

109
00:13:20.076 --> 00:13:22.090
Isn't that you?

110
00:13:25.062 --> 00:13:29.094
What do you want?
- I don't know...

111
00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:35.094
A glass of water?

112
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.094
There.

113
00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:39.014
Where to?
- I don't know.

114
00:15:54.034 --> 00:15:57.009
Yes?
- Why do you answer? You're on vacation.

115
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.018
Why do you call then?
- Just checking how you're doing.

116
00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.042
Are you getting some rest?

117
00:16:03.043 --> 00:16:06.065
Cut it out. What do you want?

118
00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:09.041
The name 'Kiruna'... rings any bell?

119
00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:14.026
It's a mining town.
north of the Arctic Circle.

120
00:16:14.027 --> 00:16:17.006
Russia or Finland?
- Sweden.

121
00:16:17.062 --> 00:16:21.082
And...?
- They're looking into the murder of a French man.

122
00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:25.013
He's been killed in a peculiar way.

123
00:16:25.014 --> 00:16:30.081
I know we should leave you alone
now that you're finally on break...

124
00:16:30.082 --> 00:16:37.082
...but the place. the brutality of the murder...
I want YOU to look into this.

125
00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:51.022
Sure? You have no obligation.
- I'm sure... I'm sure.

126
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.052
Catch you later.

127
00:17:00.012 --> 00:17:02.082
Now I know where to go.

128
00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:50.054
"The perpetrator. still unknown. tied the victim to the rotor of an helicopter.
Death was caused by the rotation".

129
00:18:30.018 --> 00:18:35.046
I appreciate you all being here
on such a short notice.

130
00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:42.062
All three shifts.
Unfortunately there's no milk.

131
00:18:45.002 --> 00:18:52.002
Criminal Police is on its way.
While we wait. I'll brief you on the situation.

132
00:19:00.054 --> 00:19:07.054
We have 2-men shifts to cover about 1/5 of the Swedish territory.
We all know this alone is practically impossible.

133
00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:16.057
But after seeing what I saw...

134
00:19:16.058 --> 00:19:23.058
...I'm gonna have to ask you for more.
To demand for more. in fact.

135
00:19:25.068 --> 00:19:31.034
I think we are facing a murderer.
or murderers.

136
00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:36.058
like were never seen around here.
or in the rest of the Country.

137
00:19:40.086 --> 00:19:44.018
Thorndal. Anders.

138
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:55.014
The pilot is still at large.
but soon as we get to know his name...

139
00:19:55.015 --> 00:20:01.050
Big jump from parking tickets. uh?
- No bullshit. please.

140
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.094
Are we clear?

141
00:20:09.026 --> 00:20:12.002
Good... go on.

142
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.078
Inspector Zadi.
I have to check Pierre Carnot's apartment.

143
00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:22.074
Hope you took your shoes off.
- Have you found something?

144
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:27.046
Rented already furnished.
but he wasn't here all the time.

145
00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:31.054
A couple of days a week or in the weekends.

146
00:21:31.064 --> 00:21:35.060
He drank coffee. brushed his teeth. loved fishing.

147
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:39.058
When is forensics coming?
- Before lunchtime.

148
00:21:42.042 --> 00:21:47.006
He was doing pretty good.
- Yes he was.

149
00:21:47.016 --> 00:21:52.546
You flight leaves at noon.
I want daily reports and no embassy involvement.

150
00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:58.078
You have access to Salvac and Anacrim
and will cooperate with the Swedish.

151
00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:01.089
Police won't lead the investigation.
a procurator will.

152
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:08.090
Foreign police cannot bring weapons along.
but I'll see you get one over there.

153
00:22:12.002 --> 00:22:16.018
I like your new style.
- Thanks.

154
00:22:16.048 --> 00:22:18.085
How many you have?

155
00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:21.069
Three gas-fueled and a larger one.

156
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:27.034
Employees?
- None. but we have 3 pilots who fly for us.

157
00:22:28.058 --> 00:22:31.073
No one was flying yesterday?
- No.

158
00:22:31.074 --> 00:22:38.074
Maybe one of them does some little work on the side?
- I wouldn't know.

159
00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:44.014
Of course you wouldn't.
that would be illegal.

160
00:22:44.058 --> 00:22:50.081
But if I happened to ask the same question
to some pilot here in Kiruna...

161
00:22:50.082 --> 00:22:57.082
...who doesn't work for you and doesn't know
I'm a procurator... what would be the answer?

162
00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.034
I...

163
00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:08.086
I think I saw Henrik here last night.

164
00:23:08.087 --> 00:23:13.050
Henrik Kam-bo?
- Yes. Kambo.

165
00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:20.014
Thanks. Do you also manage
on-line booking?

166
00:23:20.015 --> 00:23:22.078
Where's your computer?
- Why?

167
00:23:22.088 --> 00:23:28.010
Thorndal will have to take it.
- Did Henrik do something?

168
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.011
I'll take this too.

169
00:24:25.034 --> 00:24:30.036
French police already sent an inspector over.
He'll get here today.

170
00:24:30.037 --> 00:24:35.073
He's from the OCRVP.

171
00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:38.025
No less.
- You know them?

172
00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:43.013
Yes. high profile cases.
- Do they have a foreign section too?

173
00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:48.086
Don't know... but if the French send a policeman.
it's always from that office.

174
00:24:49.022 --> 00:24:56.022
Last time I worked with a foreign cop
was that mountain incident.

175
00:24:56.036 --> 00:25:01.058
That was an English cop.
it was a damn circus.

176
00:25:01.078 --> 00:25:04.074
"Bordel".
- What?

177
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:11.034
That's what the French say when all goes tits up.
"Quel bordel".

178
00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:17.030
Anders...

179
00:25:17.086 --> 00:25:21.093
Don't listen to what policemen say.

180
00:25:21.094 --> 00:25:25.053
Nevermind. You don't become prosecutor
to be popular.

181
00:25:25.054 --> 00:25:31.050
Don't let them walk over you.
- If they don't weigh much. who cares?

182
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:38.070
Homicide squad is coming.
Before I meet them. I have a favor to ask you.

183
00:25:39.028 --> 00:25:43.010
What?
- See that burner back there?

184
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.006
No need to take your shoes off.

185
00:25:49.018 --> 00:25:53.074
Leave it here. I'll move it later.

186
00:25:54.058 --> 00:25:59.002
Hey. already up?
- It seems so.

187
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:05.054
What time will people start coming?
- 7pm obviously.

188
00:26:06.046 --> 00:26:13.014
She's usually here for 2 weeks.
but Josefin's on vacation this whole month.

189
00:26:13.034 --> 00:26:16.073
Something to drink?
I got yogurt.

190
00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:21.062
New flavor. pomegranate.
Good for the stomach. try it.

191
00:26:27.054 --> 00:26:30.565
Good. isn't it? It's also good for your prostate.

192
00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:34.077
You should rest a couple of hours.
- I don't need...

193
00:26:34.078 --> 00:26:39.062
Just sleep for two hours.
I'm going down to the Station...

194
00:26:39.063 --> 00:26:41.061
..for a little briefing and to see this French.

195
00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:45.074
See if you can think of
some French contacts we might have.

196
00:26:46.086 --> 00:26:51.072
I'm taking this to go.
- Thanks for your help. Rutger.

197
00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:05.034
Hi. P. O.

198
00:27:07.028 --> 00:27:11.070
Hi. Rutger. You have a guest in the sewing room.
- A guest?

199
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:14.022
Room 204.

200
00:27:18.042 --> 00:27:21.014
Rutger Burlin.

201
00:27:23.026 --> 00:27:27.002
So... what is this about?

202
00:27:30.038 --> 00:27:33.030
Is there something you wanna tell me?

203
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.082
Nothing... but something DID happen...

204
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:53.034
It hasn't happened yet.
but it's about to.

205
00:27:55.038 --> 00:27:56.086
Got it?

206
00:27:59.026 --> 00:28:05.018
You're gonna do exactly what I tell you.
Chief Prosecutor Burlin.

207
00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:38.042
Well... I just came to tell you...
the French cop will land in about 20 minutes.

208
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.082
Hi. Kajsa.
- Hi. - Thanks. Anders.

209
00:28:45.016 --> 00:28:48.066
So... I'm just gonna go now.

210
00:28:52.018 --> 00:28:57.018
"Something that it's about to happen".

211
00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:00.014
God... it just came out of me...

212
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.026
Oh. God...

213
00:29:05.066 --> 00:29:09.054
Come here. Kajsa. Sit.

214
00:29:12.058 --> 00:29:17.050
You know what? Hail to us!
- Hail to us!

215
00:30:30.084 --> 00:30:34.018
I gotta hang up. they're here.

216
00:30:45.002 --> 00:30:46.086
You speak French?

217
00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:19.094
So Renault is here only in winter.
No activity during summer?

218
00:32:19.095 --> 00:32:21.094
Where's the wine?

219
00:32:23.094 --> 00:32:30.050
The trains that haul the iron are French. right?
I know they cost a fortune.

220
00:32:30.051 --> 00:32:33.009
Is this all?

221
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.003
Three bottles.
More than a glass each!

222
00:32:37.004 --> 00:32:42.086
No one drinks only one glass!
- Yes. if I'm paying. I'm on the phone!

223
00:32:42.087 --> 00:32:46.073
Ah. they're Swiss.
I had no idea.

224
00:32:46.074 --> 00:32:50.066
Could you sum it up in an e-mail
for me and Burlin?

225
00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:53.030
Ok. thank you.

226
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.041
Jessika!

227
00:32:55.042 --> 00:33:00.002
I'm a prosecutor.
I can't serve alcohol to minors!

228
00:33:00.094 --> 00:33:03.030
Hi. They're coming!

229
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.050
Here. water!

230
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.050
I'm good!

231
00:34:10.094 --> 00:34:14.026
Shall I ask for a quad for when we go back?

232
00:34:14.027 --> 00:34:17.026
Shut up and close the door!

233
00:35:31.026 --> 00:35:38.002
"The valley is blooming.
fragrance in fields and hills."

234
00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:45.002
"Join me in this journey
through joyful spring."

235
00:35:45.003 --> 00:35:52.002
"Each day is like a golden cup
filled with wine."

236
00:35:52.042 --> 00:35:59.042
"Drink. my friend. from the sun and perfumes
because this day is yours."

237
00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:09.014
Jessika is nice.
Her father though...

238
00:36:09.024 --> 00:36:13.018
A creep!
- You know what my mom told me?

239
00:36:39.062 --> 00:36:41.050
Help!

240
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.014
His foot is missing!

241
00:38:09.018 --> 00:38:12.070
Kambo...?
It's Kambo!

242
00:38:18.042 --> 00:38:21.018
Hold tight!
- I know!

243
00:38:26.024 --> 00:38:28.042
Hurry up. dammit!

244
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.061
It's gonna be alright.

245
00:38:35.062 --> 00:38:38.086
We have to move!
- I got it!

246
00:38:48.028 --> 00:38:52.029
How long til Kiruna?
- 18 minutes.

247
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.098
We don't have 18 minutes!
- I could fly over the Kebne...

248
00:38:56.099 --> 00:38:59.032
...although I don't like those clouds.

249
00:38:59.033 --> 00:39:03.006
Take the quickest way!
- Ok.

250
00:39:11.001 --> 00:39:13.010
Faster!
- Go!

251
00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:31.090
What did you say?

252
00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:36.022
I can't hear you!
Tell me!

253
00:44:40.082 --> 00:44:47.046
Sorry for everything. Thanks for
everything. Hail to us. YOUR WIFE.

254
00:44:52.062 --> 00:44:57.030
The French has been settled in.
- Good.

255
00:45:01.062 --> 00:45:06.093
I was thinking... it's a long way
back to Gällivare.

256
00:45:06.094 --> 00:45:13.026
There's a bed in the consultant's office
but you can use our guest bed if you like.

257
00:45:13.046 --> 00:45:15.054
Guest bed?

258
00:45:15.064 --> 00:45:17.074
That'll be perfect.

259
00:45:19.066 --> 00:45:25.018
Me. I'm going home to check
if they managed to set fire to it.

260
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.042
Yes. you go home.

261
00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:33.097
What happened with Kajsa was...

262
00:45:33.098 --> 00:45:39.045
We've been having some problems lately.
so we went to see a therapist.

263
00:45:39.046 --> 00:45:46.046
Josefin wanted us to see one too.
- For very different reasons though. right?

264
00:45:47.074 --> 00:45:51.571
The therapist advice was...

265
00:45:51.572 --> 00:45:56.070
...to be a little more 'kinky'.

266
00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:01.038
You gotta forgive us...
- Of course. no problem at all.

267
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:08.034
Call Kajsa.
she can sleep here as well.

268
00:46:08.054 --> 00:46:11.033
Let's not push it now.
- No...

269
00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:15.090
Go home.
- I'll see you later. Thanks for earlier.

270
00:46:16.074 --> 00:46:20.038
Connection between the pilot and Carnot?
- Don't know yet.

271
00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:24.030
It's 1 in the morning now.
see the light?

272
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:26.059
How can they sleep...

273
00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.070
They sleep all winter. isn't that enough?
- Maybe.

274
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:33.042
Did you get the file?
- Wait.

275
00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:39.070
Yes. with the photograph.
I'll send it to the prosecutor.

276
00:46:39.071 --> 00:46:42.030
The passport picture is our only trace.

277
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:44.081
There's gotta be something else.

278
00:46:44.082 --> 00:46:49.074
I keep looking.
- Ok. I'm going to sleep now. goodnight.

279
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:15.010
Let's make a toast!

280
00:49:08.026 --> 00:49:10.030
Hi sweet.

281
00:49:11.002 --> 00:49:13.026
Party effects?

282
00:49:16.022 --> 00:49:19.074
Promise not to tell mom.

283
00:49:23.082 --> 00:49:25.065
I promise...

284
00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:30.022
...not to tell her
you're drunk from one glass of wine.

285
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:38.026
How did the party go anyway?
- Fine.

286
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:49.042
There's something I wanna tell you about.

287
00:49:49.074 --> 00:49:54.077
You might be disappointed.
or even angry.

288
00:49:54.078 --> 00:50:01.038
I don't know what you heard...
people talk a lot in small towns.

289
00:50:01.039 --> 00:50:05.002
You might wonder why I don't see other women
after mom...

290
00:50:10.018 --> 00:50:13.002
Get it out.
Get it all out.

291
00:50:55.081 --> 00:50:57.070
I can't see anything!

292
00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:18.001
There's traces on the ground.

293
00:51:18.002 --> 00:51:23.070
Seems like rocks and logs had been... moved.

294
00:51:24.054 --> 00:51:26.062
Yes... moved.

295
00:51:28.038 --> 00:51:29.086
Why?

296
00:51:37.002 --> 00:51:41.070
It's me. Still sleeping?
- Naturally... how are you?

297
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:46.077
All good. the usual circus.

298
00:51:46.078 --> 00:51:51.038
I miss you.
When are you coming home?

299
00:51:51.048 --> 00:51:56.018
Anders is lending me his guest room.

300
00:51:56.019 --> 00:51:59.046
I got your text.

301
00:52:00.002 --> 00:52:04.042
Hail to us. huh?
- Hail to us.

302
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:11.090
Rutger! Get back on the phone!
Where are you. Rutger?!

303
00:53:27.034 --> 00:53:32.026
Kajsa. call an ambulance!
I think Rutger is having a stroke!

304
00:53:32.027 --> 00:53:36.042
Reenstiernagatan 3A. Call now!

305
00:53:43.074 --> 00:53:47.082
Rutger. look at me!
Look at me!

306
00:53:50.028 --> 00:53:54.006
Help!
