00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:08.554
<i>Hello. I'm LESTR.</i>

2
00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:11.098
Meet our new doorman. We
named him after the dead one.

3
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:14.810
What's happening to our
sweet little murder building?

4
00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:16.520
Things are changing fast.

5
00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:18.564
You... You go. uh.
talk to Lester's wife.

6
00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:20.650
-Lillian loves me.
-It's Lorraine.

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.568
I'm in Dr. Tidyman's
trial group.

8
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.862
and I'd like to get the
next four doses of...

9
00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.657
Nicky used to carry these decks
around everywhere he went.

10
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.743
-Maybe it's something.
-I have a facility with cards.

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.286
Oh.

12
00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:34.080
Among other things.

13
00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:36.082
This table's been through it.

14
00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:37.875
What do you think happened here?

15
00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.461
I was playing with these
bozos the night Nicky died.

16
00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:42.672
So Nicky... "chh!"...
chopped off his finger.

17
00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:44.840
Jay lost
his right finger.

18
00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:47.468
The finger we have curves left.

19
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:48.886
This isn't his finger.

20
00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.513
Per the
contract you just signed.

21
00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:52.974
you're unable to podcast about
management of the company.

22
00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:55.518
And we have new
majority stakeholders.

23
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:56.685
Who?

24
00:00:57.644 --> 00:00:59.021
<i>They joined forces.</i>

25
00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:00.648
<i>They're all dirty.</i>

26
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:04.276
Wow. this was really under
the Arconia all these years?

27
00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.822
Yes. and Lester and Nicky
have both been here.

28
00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:10.783
This room has gotta hold
some answers for us.

29
00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:15.663
<i>You know what real money buys?</i>

30
00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:20.668
<i>I'm not talking yachts or jets</i>

31
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:22.920
<i>or even one of those
cute little pygmy hippos.</i>

32
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.422
<i>That's what I'd get.</i>

33
00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.133
<i>He'd live in my bathtub.
it'd be cute as hell.</i>

34
00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.593
<i>Anyways. I'm talking real money.</i>

35
00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:31.387
<i>the "fuck you" kind.</i>

36
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.558
<i>That money buys the most
valuable thing there is:</i>

37
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:36.642
<i>silence.</i>

38
00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:40.730
<i>Nobody's ratting out the rich.</i>

39
00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:42.064
<i>Why?</i>

40
00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:45.359
<i>Because they'll
squash you like a bug.</i>

41
00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:49.030
And so. over here.
uh. we found a tear

42
00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:51.032
in this ta... table?

43
00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.659
Well. it must have
been done by a cleaver.

44
00:01:53.742 --> 00:01:56.037
but it's been repaired...?

45
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.748
And under here is a...
a-a-a secret drawer

46
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.958
where we found an
envelope full of money.

47
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:03.127
It opens with a code
from the roulette wheel.

48
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.837
Okay. got it.

49
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380
Oh. now hold on
a goddamn minute.

50
00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:10.134
You mean to tell me that there's
been this giant-ass gaming palace

51
00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:11.844
down here the whole time.

52
00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:13.846
but you guys are just
finding out about it?

53
00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.724
Well. to be fair. I just found
out this building has a gym.

54
00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:18.517
Hmm. I don't know.

55
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.604
It looks pretty
fucking clean. guys.

56
00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:23.647
I could eat lamb chops
on this poker table.

57
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.691
But we saw blood.

58
00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:27.818
They... They... They cleaned.

59
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.613
Are you telling me that the
super-villains got in here with a Swiffer?

60
00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.573
Of course. they didn't.
And that's your in.

61
00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:34.658
Somebody's cleaning up
after these motherfuckers.

62
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:38.287
which probably means it's someone
that works in the building.

63
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.997
A little pro-police hack:

64
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.209
when investigating the
super-rich. talk to the help.

65
00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:45.669
Rich people are constantly doing
dumb shit in front of them.

66
00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:47.838
She's right. And they
probably paid off the police.

67
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:49.799
You know. two cops showed
up at the dry cleaners

68
00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:52.385
to "find" Nicky's body.

69
00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:53.635
Do you know these two cops?

70
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.930
Oh. yeah!

71
00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:57.932
Okay. so that one
over there is Bobby.

72
00:02:58.015 --> 00:02:59.809
And that's
my good friend Freddy.

73
00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:01.018
You know. he tells the best...

74
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:02.770
Are you fucking kidding me?

75
00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:05.022
Do you actually know how
many people are in the NYPD?

76
00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:07.525
And even if I could ID
these guys. I wouldn't.

77
00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:10.486
Because the last guy that
tried to expose dirty cops

78
00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.530
had to move to Florida.

79
00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:14.156
God. does that
mean he got killed?

80
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.284
No. it means he actually
has to <i>live</i> in Florida.

81
00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:19.578
Oh. my God.

82
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.248
What... What about taking
our finger to a lab?

83
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.332
Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:25.376
I mean. if it isn't Jay
Pflug's. whose is it?

85
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.837
I hear you. but I'm gonna have to
get back to you guys on that one.

86
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.381
I gotta head to the
preschool. I'm on snack duty.

87
00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:32.258
A Black gay parent can't also be

88
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:33.843
hauling some random-ass
finger around.

89
00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:36.929
Okay. fair. fair.
But what about Sofia?

90
00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:39.181
She's the one that gave us
the cards to get in here.

91
00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:41.475
-She must know something.
-I'll question her.

92
00:03:41.558 --> 00:03:44.478
She and I had a bit of a
connection in Staten Island.

93
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.106
If there's anything to
say. she'll say it to me.

94
00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:52.736
So. that's it?
There's nothing to find here?

95
00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.239
Well. whoever cleaned up
in here missed one thing.

96
00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:56.532
Oh. did you find a weapon?

97
00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:58.784
Worse. Shrimp tails.

98
00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:01.912
You know. they can commit murder.
they can take away our podcast.

99
00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:06.333
but nobody. <i>nobody</i>
eats my wedding shrimp.

100
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.337
I paid for six tubs of shrimp.

101
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.798
and only five made it
back to my apartment.

102
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:14.675
So. these people saw my shrimp

103
00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:16.719
unattended in the lobby
and just helped themselves.

104
00:04:16.802 --> 00:04:18.596
I mean. what kind
of world is this?

105
00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:20.264
Are we nothing but animals?

106
00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.766
Oliver. it's
possible that their shrimp

107
00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.560
had nothing to do
with your shrimp.

108
00:04:24.643 --> 00:04:26.187
Charles. don't you
share my outrage?

109
00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:29.940
What is he doing?

110
00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:32.526
Oh. my God. he's swiping.

111
00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:35.196
Uh. Charles. are
you on the apps?

112
00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.447
Oh. uh. yeah.

113
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.450
I. uh. joined a dating
service for sexy seniors.

114
00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.951
It's called. uh. Last Gasp.

115
00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:42.953
You're on Last Gasp?

116
00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:45.664
Okay. very soon I'm
gonna be a good friend.

117
00:04:45.747 --> 00:04:49.084
but it has been a rough few days
and I'm desperate for a laugh.

118
00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:51.295
May I see your profile?

119
00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:55.049
Okay.

120
00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:57.343
Your picture is a
signed headshot.

121
00:04:57.426 --> 00:04:59.470
I'm already feeling better.

122
00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:01.889
Uh. you appear to have
checked the box "bi-curious."

123
00:05:01.972 --> 00:05:02.973
Oh!

124
00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.266
I thought it said "bi-coastal."

125
00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.935
That explains some
of the responses.

126
00:05:06.018 --> 00:05:08.312
Okay. I need one more good
laugh...

127
00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:10.231
...and yes. there it is.

128
00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:12.942
Under. "Looking for."
you've said. "Clicker."

129
00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:14.652
Well. yeah. I can't... I
can't find it anywhere.

130
00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:16.695
Plus. I think it's kinda
cool that a TV star

131
00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:18.113
can't find his clicker.

132
00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:19.532
'cause it's so relatable.

133
00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:21.534
Yeah. I'm
your friend again.

134
00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:23.035
Honestly. Charles.

135
00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:24.995
I... I'm really glad that
you're getting out there.

136
00:05:25.078 --> 00:05:27.206
Well. thank you. And this
little. uh. side venture

137
00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.999
won't take my focus
away from the case.

138
00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:30.543
I'm going to see Sofia.

139
00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:32.503
And... Oh. boy.

140
00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:36.507
Mm. Betty Grable. yum. yum. yum.

141
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.634
I wouldn't mind having
a...

142
00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:42.805
So. I need to be away from
whatever is happening here.

143
00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:45.140
We are gonna go question
the building staff

144
00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:46.684
and you've got Sofia.

145
00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:49.186
Don't fuck it up. Charles.

146
00:05:51.313 --> 00:05:53.482
-Okay. okay. okay. okay. okay.
-Yeah! What...

147
00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:55.818
Phallic knickknack
down. eyes on me.

148
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:57.236
What is going on with you?

149
00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.529
What do you mean? Nothing.

150
00:05:58.612 --> 00:06:00.864
You're lifting weights.
you're acting weird.

151
00:06:00.947 --> 00:06:02.366
What are you talking
about? It's nothing.

152
00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.994
I'm just taking
a new multivitamin.

153
00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:09.665
I'm taking
testosterone.

154
00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:11.208
What? Why?

155
00:06:11.291 --> 00:06:14.753
My doctor asked me if I wanted to
join a trial group of guys my age.

156
00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:17.506
It's supposed to build bone
strength and give you energy.

157
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.216
-Is it working?
-I think so.

158
00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:21.594
I mean. uh. my mouth
tastes like pennies.

159
00:06:21.677 --> 00:06:25.347
Yesterday. I opened a pickle
jar like it was no thang.

160
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.308
And I think it's
affecting my pheromones.

161
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:29.602
I'm being followed by cats.

162
00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:37.150
And you know what? If
I'm being honest...

163
00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:41.113
I am really fighting the urge
to pick you up right now.

164
00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:43.115
-Oh. please don't.
-Coming at ya!

165
00:06:43.198 --> 00:06:44.992
No! Oh. no. no. Charles. please.

166
00:06:45.075 --> 00:06:46.493
Put me down. Charles. don't.

167
00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:48.579
Charles! Ahh!

Support us and become VIP member 
to remove all ads from www.OpenSubtitles.org

169
00:07:41.047 --> 00:07:44.551
{\an8}Ooh. the Arconia downstairs.

170
00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:46.011
{\an8}Very <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

171
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.182
{\an8}Will we turn a corner and
find a whole room of people

172
00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:52.309
{\an8}merrily polishing spoons?

173
00:07:57.731 --> 00:07:58.941
{\an8}Oh. hey. Randall.

174
00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:00.025
{\an8}Can we ask you a question?

175
00:08:00.108 --> 00:08:02.277
{\an8}Yes. it involves a secret gaming parlor

176
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.362
{\an8}in The Arconia.

177
00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:05.239
{\an8}Uh. is this another
building test?

178
00:08:05.322 --> 00:08:07.491
{\an8}-Was. uh. this in the ledger?
-Randall?

179
00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:09.076
-Hm? Hm?
-No need for you

180
00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:10.786
to drop off Miss
Morton's prescription.

181
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:12.371
LESTR here already got it.

182
00:08:12.454 --> 00:08:14.206
Uh. Miss Morton likes
when I drop it off. so...

183
00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:15.332
{\an8}Already done.

184
00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:17.418
{\an8}LESTR here is not a stupid
human who needs sleep.

185
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:19.169
{\an8}All of the deliveries
are done overnight.

186
00:08:19.252 --> 00:08:20.921
{\an8}Wonderful.

187
00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:24.633
Not used to seeing you
two around these parts.

188
00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:25.800
Investigating?

189
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:28.262
-Well...
-No. no. no. don't worry. don't worry.

190
00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:31.098
My days of trying to join
your little trio are over.

191
00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:32.683
I have traded up.

192
00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:34.476
Information is power.

193
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.479
and LESTR here is a
hotbed of building gossip.

194
00:08:37.562 --> 00:08:38.814
LESTR. hit 'em with a nugget.

195
00:08:38.897 --> 00:08:41.942
<i>Dr. Grover Stanley
in apartment 6C has Crohn's.</i>

196
00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:46.071
Ooh! I do get an endorphin
rush off facts about neighbors.

197
00:08:46.154 --> 00:08:47.489
Gimme another one. little guy.

198
00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:49.283
Not now.
Oliver. There's Ursula.

199
00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:50.367
Oh.

200
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.078
<i>Mrs. Beroni's
third cousin has gout.</i>

201
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:55.164
I said it can't be
all medical gossip.

202
00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:02.963
Hey girl... sula. what's up?

203
00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:04.298
Drop the act.

204
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:06.591
We both know there's
something urgent to discuss.

205
00:09:10.512 --> 00:09:12.639
Gut Milk now comes as a pellet.

206
00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:15.684
Same ingredients. just
hardened into a little ball.

207
00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:19.104
You can use it like a
lozenge or a suppository.

208
00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:21.064
depending on what floats
your boat.

209
00:09:21.147 --> 00:09:23.442
Oh. you solved a problem
I didn't know I had.

210
00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:25.194
How many cartons should
I put you down for?

211
00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:27.029
Depends.

212
00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:28.322
Ursula. I'm sure you know

213
00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:30.407
that there's a gaming
parlor in this building.

214
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.659
I don't know.

215
00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:35.120
-Is there a gaming parlor in the building?
-Okay. okay.

216
00:09:35.203 --> 00:09:36.789
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
yeah. I get it.

217
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.919
The casino? Sure.

218
00:09:42.002 --> 00:09:43.587
Worst kept secret
in the building.

219
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.256
Now. if there's an
open position as dealer

220
00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:50.135
or... I'll say what we're all
thinking... exotic dancer. let me know.

221
00:09:50.218 --> 00:09:51.970
I'm in the market
for a side hustle.

222
00:09:52.053 --> 00:09:54.097
Isn't Gut Milk your side hustle?

223
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.060
Honey. working here. you
can't depend on tips anymore.

224
00:09:58.143 --> 00:09:59.937
Not when all the
tenants are moving out.

225
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.146
Sad to see.

226
00:10:01.229 --> 00:10:04.691
And now. they're hiring
robots to replace us.

227
00:10:04.774 --> 00:10:06.860
Matter of time till
I'm on the street.

228
00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:10.030
Look. we believe that there was
a murder in that gaming parlor.

229
00:10:10.113 --> 00:10:13.909
but when we went to look for
evidence. it had all been cleaned up.

230
00:10:13.992 --> 00:10:15.285
Do you know anything about that?

231
00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:18.789
Lester was tight-lipped about
what went on in that room.

232
00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:22.376
But I know all service work
had to go through one person.

233
00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:24.962
He let a name slip once.

234
00:10:25.045 --> 00:10:26.380
Tommy the Tongue.

235
00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:29.341
The Tongue? What does that mean?

236
00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:31.969
Multiple tongues? No
tongue? Split tongue?

237
00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:33.762
Maybe he was there that night.

238
00:10:33.845 --> 00:10:35.931
Maybe it's Tommy's finger.

239
00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:39.476
Ursula. do you happen to know
if he was missing a finger?

240
00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.853
And if so. if he put it
in my wedding shrimp?

241
00:10:43.647 --> 00:10:45.607
You got a lot of
nerve. you know that?

242
00:10:46.608 --> 00:10:49.903
Coming around here.
asking questions.

243
00:10:49.986 --> 00:10:51.613
We're looking into
this for Lester.

244
00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:55.909
I'd take a bullet for
that little <i>Monopoly</i> man.

245
00:10:55.992 --> 00:10:59.496
But you two and the
white-haired guy.

246
00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:02.958
you were the beginning of
the end for this place.

247
00:11:25.063 --> 00:11:27.565
Tommy the Tongue? What the...?

248
00:11:29.526 --> 00:11:30.735
Hey.

249
00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:34.072
Hello. Savage.

250
00:11:37.659 --> 00:11:39.953
Shall we find a
nice quiet booth?

251
00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:42.289
<i>Marone!</i>

252
00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:50.088
Okay. clearly. Ursula
does not wanna talk to us.

253
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:53.300
But whoever cleaned had to have
thrown stuff out in the trash.

254
00:11:53.383 --> 00:11:54.968
-Right. right. right.
-Which means someone here

255
00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:56.595
still has access to evidence.

256
00:11:56.678 --> 00:11:58.388
Right. Well. at
least until tomorrow.

257
00:11:58.471 --> 00:12:01.224
Isn't that trash day? Oh.
my God. we're on a clock.

258
00:12:01.307 --> 00:12:03.560
-I love a clock.
-You know who we should talk to?

259
00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:04.895
Gary. the trash guy.

260
00:12:04.978 --> 00:12:06.939
Yes! Yes. Gary
and I go way back.

261
00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:09.399
In fact. he was the one
who rescued my Tony in '94

262
00:12:09.482 --> 00:12:11.109
when I accidentally
put it down the chute.

263
00:12:11.192 --> 00:12:12.235
Your Tony?

264
00:12:12.318 --> 00:12:14.321
My Tony Robbins bobblehead.

265
00:12:14.404 --> 00:12:16.990
I got it on the last night of the
seminar when I walked the hot coals.

266
00:12:17.073 --> 00:12:18.158
I told you that.

267
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:22.788
Uh. Gary?

268
00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:27.876
Gary's dead.

269
00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.002
Oh.

270
00:12:29.085 --> 00:12:31.880
To me. He retired.

271
00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:35.467
Said. "there's more to
life than building trash."

272
00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:41.139
-I'm Miller.
-Ah.

273
00:12:41.222 --> 00:12:44.142
Well. uh. welcome to
the building. Miller.

274
00:12:44.225 --> 00:12:45.935
I started three years ago.

275
00:12:46.936 --> 00:12:48.105
Sorry I missed that.

276
00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:49.189
I'm Oliver.

277
00:12:49.272 --> 00:12:51.233
Of course. And you're Mabel.

278
00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:52.901
I know you both.

279
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.988
So. you listen to our podcast?

280
00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:57.363
Nah.

281
00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:00.158
Doesn't come through on this.

282
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:03.286
Where's Charles. by the way?

283
00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:05.956
And how's he reacting
to the testosterone?

284
00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:08.500
Nice to see him
prioritizing his libido.

285
00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:12.337
Mm. okay. so really
wish I didn't know that.

286
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.047
But it does explain a lot.

287
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.298
Sorry.

288
00:13:15.381 --> 00:13:18.093
You get to know people
when you do their trash.

289
00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:22.014
Speaking of. Oliver. I can't
believe you threw away that offer.

290
00:13:22.097 --> 00:13:23.974
-Okay.
-Offer? What offer?

291
00:13:24.057 --> 00:13:26.518
-On his apartment.
-It was nothing. it was nothing.

292
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:29.396
Generous. too. Felt like
more than the going rate

293
00:13:29.479 --> 00:13:30.939
for a two bedroom
in this building.

294
00:13:31.022 --> 00:13:33.525
Why didn't you tell me about this?

295
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:38.739
Listen. uh. um. Miller. has any
unusual trash recently come in.

296
00:13:38.822 --> 00:13:40.991
uh. uh. perhaps from
the gaming parlor?

297
00:13:41.074 --> 00:13:42.367
Uh...

298
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.370
Maybe something concerning
"Tommy the Tongue"?

299
00:13:45.453 --> 00:13:47.038
Time for you all to leave.

300
00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:50.542
I don't believe in
sharing my garbage.

301
00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:52.127
Not with upstairs folk.

302
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.920
Trash!

303
00:13:54.003 --> 00:13:55.338
-Go. go!
-Come on. pick it up!

304
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:57.174
We're leaving.

305
00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:05.015
I was starting to
think you'd never call.

306
00:14:05.098 --> 00:14:06.725
And I was starting to
think that maybe...

307
00:14:06.808 --> 00:14:07.892
Ma!

308
00:14:09.143 --> 00:14:10.312
I tried salad!

309
00:14:10.395 --> 00:14:12.063
Is this... Is this
chicken the spicy kind?

310
00:14:12.146 --> 00:14:13.940
Do they have noodles and butter?

311
00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:16.401
I had... I had to bring 'em.

312
00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:19.529
It's Mikey's Birthday.
He's 36 today.

313
00:14:19.612 --> 00:14:22.449
But they're going to
sit at their own table.

314
00:14:22.532 --> 00:14:24.075
like real adults!

315
00:14:24.158 --> 00:14:25.494
Mom. I'm drowning.

316
00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:28.079
Waiter. another
martini. another round.

317
00:14:28.162 --> 00:14:29.873
-How are ya?
-That's Mayor Tillman!

318
00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:31.374
Don't be afraid to
make these ones dirty.

319
00:14:31.457 --> 00:14:32.459
Charles?

320
00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:33.543
It's Mayor Tillman!

321
00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:35.003
Mr. Mayor!

322
00:14:35.086 --> 00:14:36.338
-What a surprise!
-Hey. bring it in.

323
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:38.340
Oh. we're doing this?

324
00:14:38.423 --> 00:14:40.258
Uh. this is Sofia Caccimelio.

325
00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:41.468
Pleasure.

326
00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:45.096
I saw your picture in the
paper next to the sad news

327
00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:47.641
about your husband.
My condolences.

328
00:14:47.724 --> 00:14:49.392
-Tony. stop.
-Ma!

329
00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:51.269
-Shut the fuck up. shut up!
-You shut up.

330
00:14:51.352 --> 00:14:52.854
How is the pod?

331
00:14:52.937 --> 00:14:54.856
Right. I'm... Hey.
I'm still avail

332
00:14:54.939 --> 00:14:56.608
to guest. FYI.

333
00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:59.027
Or. you know. I could just...
I could just do sound effects.

334
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.238
You know. throw in a.
ya know. "honk-honk!"

335
00:15:01.321 --> 00:15:02.489
Or a. you know.

336
00:15:02.572 --> 00:15:03.698
"Where's the beef?" You know?

337
00:15:03.781 --> 00:15:05.659
-I don't know.
-So funny. but it's not really.

338
00:15:05.742 --> 00:15:07.994
uh. that type of podcast.
It's more murder-centric.

339
00:15:08.077 --> 00:15:09.871
Oh. "Awooga!"

340
00:15:09.954 --> 00:15:12.082
That's a fun one.
too. You know. it's...

341
00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:13.959
So. get in touch with Romy
and we'll set something up.

342
00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:16.002
-Okay. I'll be in touch.
-Great. Okay.

343
00:15:16.085 --> 00:15:17.546
-Ooh.
-Sorry. Oh!

344
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:19.673
My body is brimming with
male hormones right now.

345
00:15:19.756 --> 00:15:22.300
-My handshake could crush a walnut.
-Ah. Alright.

346
00:15:22.926 --> 00:15:25.178
Hmm...

347
00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:29.015
Mm.

348
00:15:31.726 --> 00:15:34.521
Are we even allowed to be
in the staff locker room?

349
00:15:34.604 --> 00:15:35.856
Feels wrong.

350
00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:38.900
Like... Like seeing the pilot
on the plane using the bathroom.

351
00:15:38.983 --> 00:15:40.652
I mean. who's driving?

352
00:15:40.735 --> 00:15:42.737
Well. if we can't get
the staff to talk.

353
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.074
we'll just have to find the trash
room key and get in there ourselves.

354
00:15:46.157 --> 00:15:47.534
Ah. look.

355
00:15:47.617 --> 00:15:49.953
Spare bulbs for the
lobby chandelier.

356
00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:52.747
lint brushes for the
doormen's uniforms.

357
00:15:54.332 --> 00:15:56.668
All little pieces of Arconiana.

358
00:15:57.794 --> 00:15:58.962
Oliver?

359
00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:02.340
Please don't move.

360
00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:05.677
I know you're an adult and
you can do whatever you want.

361
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.306
but I committed to this
building. I bought a couch.

362
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:11.308
I'm not moving.

363
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:13.059
The Arconia is my place.

364
00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:16.854
Speaking of.

365
00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:19.733
"Putnam sucks."

366
00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:21.901
That's charming.

367
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.029
Wait a minute.

368
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.493
-Oh. my God.
-Hey.

369
00:16:31.494 --> 00:16:33.330
You aren't supposed
to be in here.

370
00:16:40.336 --> 00:16:43.506
Uh. we... we were just
leaving our holiday tips.

371
00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:46.551
Five months late. or seven months
early. whatever is more believable.

372
00:16:47.677 --> 00:16:50.430
Oh. my God. Jose the Super!

373
00:16:50.513 --> 00:16:52.349
I... I thought you'd
left the building.

374
00:16:52.432 --> 00:16:55.352
Just last week. I denied
your request for a bidet.

375
00:16:55.435 --> 00:16:57.020
Randall. they saw the table.

376
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.066
So. this is your handiwork?

377
00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:03.944
Look. I did carve that.

378
00:17:04.027 --> 00:17:08.365
I'm not proud of it. but this
is not about Lester the human.

379
00:17:08.448 --> 00:17:10.158
-This is about the robot.
-Mm.

380
00:17:10.241 --> 00:17:12.744
And what are the chances? The
same week I start full-time.

381
00:17:12.827 --> 00:17:16.331
they... they bring in this...
this new gizmo that does my job

382
00:17:16.414 --> 00:17:18.083
-better and faster than me.
-Mm-hmm.

383
00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:19.209
You think you aren't next?

384
00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:20.794
-Uh-huh.
-Oh. my days are numbered.

385
00:17:20.877 --> 00:17:23.338
The point is. we're dinosaurs.

386
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:25.048
How long before cars
start to park themselves?

387
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:28.176
For years. we've
taken care of these tenants.

388
00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:29.928
And now that we're
getting drummed out.

389
00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:32.389
you think any of them
are standing up for us?

390
00:17:32.472 --> 00:17:34.390
I'll stand up for you.

391
00:17:35.224 --> 00:17:36.142
You will?

392
00:17:36.225 --> 00:17:38.144
This is how we get them
to talk. Win their trust.

393
00:17:38.227 --> 00:17:40.021
Alright. people.

394
00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:42.482
Who's ready to fight?

395
00:17:42.565 --> 00:17:45.068
-Yeah.
-Who's ready for a revolution?

396
00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:46.611
Yeah!

397
00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:49.364
Who's ready for a
building meeting?

398
00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:50.740
I...

399
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.621
So. let's. uh. cut right to it.

400
00:17:57.747 --> 00:17:59.624
There's a secret room in the
building where your husband

401
00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:02.377
ran an illegal poker
game. You gave me the key.

402
00:18:03.503 --> 00:18:05.130
Deck of cards.

403
00:18:05.213 --> 00:18:07.048
The king of hearts
opened the gaming parlor.

404
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:10.802
The deck of cards
is a key. Of course.

405
00:18:10.885 --> 00:18:14.305
Well. add that to the list of things
I didn't know about my husband.

406
00:18:15.723 --> 00:18:18.142
You're saying you had no idea
what your husband was up to?

407
00:18:20.812 --> 00:18:24.399
I'm more interested in
what <i>you're</i> up to. Charles.

408
00:18:30.613 --> 00:18:33.825
I see it's not someone's
first time at hibachi.

409
00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:36.661
I'm known
for my impressive mouth work.

410
00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:45.003
But what's more impressive is
your ability to change the topic.

411
00:18:54.095 --> 00:18:56.931
Mushroom! Heavy on
the yum yum sauce.

412
00:19:07.608 --> 00:19:11.363
Nicky wasn't the thug
they made him out to be.

413
00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:14.365
Everyone in my family was in...

414
00:19:16.284 --> 00:19:17.785
"construction."

415
00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:23.166
I was determined to find a husband
who wasn't "in construction."

416
00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:29.005
And then I met Nicky.
this sensitive kid.

417
00:19:29.088 --> 00:19:32.759
who worked at his family's dry
cleaners and wrote poetry on the side.

418
00:19:32.842 --> 00:19:36.596
When I'd come
to pick up my pants.

419
00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:38.890
there'd be poems
tucked in the pocket.

420
00:19:38.973 --> 00:19:41.684
-Aw.
-They were terrible.

421
00:19:41.767 --> 00:19:43.728
Compared everything
to a summer's day.

422
00:19:43.811 --> 00:19:45.522
Me. the cat.

423
00:19:45.605 --> 00:19:49.942
even... a summer's day
reminded him of a summer's day.

424
00:19:51.652 --> 00:19:54.280
When we were first married...

425
00:19:54.363 --> 00:19:57.158
we used to talk about
leaving it all behind.

426
00:19:57.241 --> 00:20:00.537
We'd get a place in
Positano and he'd write.

427
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.830
I'd wear a big hat.

428
00:20:02.997 --> 00:20:04.833
But the big hat never
happened. did it?

429
00:20:04.916 --> 00:20:06.083
No.

430
00:20:07.376 --> 00:20:09.254
Not so much as a visor.

431
00:20:12.507 --> 00:20:14.967
I blame my mother.

432
00:20:17.178 --> 00:20:20.973
She doesn't respect
men who aren't brutes.

433
00:20:22.058 --> 00:20:27.063
And she ground Nicky down until
finally. he stopped writing

434
00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:30.150
and became a liar and a cheat.

435
00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:32.735
just like every man
I ever grew up with.

436
00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:35.780
Sounds like our mothers
had a few things in common.

437
00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:37.782
Tell me more.

438
00:20:37.907 --> 00:20:39.951
Let's just say. she
did a number on me.

439
00:20:45.373 --> 00:20:46.707
Excuse me. I...

440
00:20:47.708 --> 00:20:49.043
Grief is funny.

441
00:20:49.126 --> 00:20:51.296
You never know when
it's gonna... hit.

442
00:20:51.379 --> 00:20:53.882
Look. there can't be
anything between us.

443
00:20:53.965 --> 00:20:54.966
I'm a professional.

444
00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:57.177
And I'm
wearing red lingerie.

445
00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.887
Semi-professional.

446
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.764
It's late.

447
00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:05.518
I'm gonna... Maybe you...
you see me out to my minivan?

448
00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:08.188
Well. what about the boys?

449
00:21:08.271 --> 00:21:09.481
They're alright.

450
00:21:09.564 --> 00:21:11.858
They can take the bus home alone
if they all stick together.

451
00:21:11.941 --> 00:21:14.110
Do you hear me? You
all stick together.

452
00:21:14.193 --> 00:21:16.571
-We want to go play <i>Fortnite.</i>
-Tony. we talked about this.

453
00:21:16.654 --> 00:21:18.948
-We're taking a break from screens.
-What?!

454
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:20.408
Yeah. it's his birthday!

455
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:22.827
So. Charles...

456
00:21:23.869 --> 00:21:25.788
what's it gonna be?

457
00:21:29.959 --> 00:21:32.378
-Oh yeah.
-Be safe. Mom!

458
00:21:45.266 --> 00:21:46.601
-Hello.
-Hi.

459
00:21:46.684 --> 00:21:48.144
Hi. How are ya?

460
00:21:48.227 --> 00:21:49.604
-Good.
-Good to see you.

461
00:21:49.687 --> 00:21:51.397
-Any word from Charles?
-Nothing.

462
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.608
But we shouldn't panic.
Charles is a grown man...

463
00:21:54.483 --> 00:21:57.111
who's on a downward spiral
and strung out on T.

464
00:21:57.194 --> 00:21:59.197
Yes. quite possibly
he's dead in a dumpster.

465
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.533
Well. in other bad news.
I went on the internet

466
00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:03.201
to search "Tommy the Tongue".

467
00:22:03.284 --> 00:22:05.119
Didn't find anything
that wasn't porn.

468
00:22:05.202 --> 00:22:07.789
I even begged Williams to
run his name at the station.

469
00:22:07.872 --> 00:22:11.376
Mabel. I'm telling you. this
building meeting is our ticket.

470
00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:13.127
We make the staff
fall in love with us

471
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.547
and tell us everything we need
to know about Tommy the Tongue.

472
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.549
all before the garbage truck gets here.

473
00:22:17.632 --> 00:22:20.343
Well. this little stunt isn't
gonna do much for your ranking.

474
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:21.553
My ranking?

475
00:22:21.636 --> 00:22:23.721
Last night I was using
LESTR's makeover app

476
00:22:23.804 --> 00:22:28.142
to try new beard styles. and
I stumbled upon a feature.

477
00:22:28.809 --> 00:22:32.355
A ranking system for each
tenant in the building.

478
00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:34.274
We all have a numerical value.

479
00:22:34.357 --> 00:22:36.401
Isn't that dystopian
and fabulous?

480
00:22:36.484 --> 00:22:38.987
And the robot decides
our value how?

481
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.364
Some combination of
dead Lester's paperwork.

482
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:42.699
which was all uploaded.

483
00:22:42.782 --> 00:22:45.326
gossip that I've whispered
into his listening device.

484
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:46.953
and a certain <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

485
00:22:47.036 --> 00:22:49.706
which he will never reveal.

486
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:51.207
And don't bother
asking your ranking.

487
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.958
because you will have
to die not knowing.

488
00:22:53.959 --> 00:22:55.378
Okay. Mabel. you're four.

489
00:22:55.461 --> 00:22:57.088
I'm four?

490
00:22:57.171 --> 00:22:58.298
That's not bad.

491
00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:00.758
-Wait. is THĒ above me?
-I do not need to know my number.

492
00:23:00.841 --> 00:23:02.927
I'm very confident with
my place in this building.

493
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.305
Whatever you say. Mr. 237.

494
00:23:05.388 --> 00:23:06.681
Two-thirty-seven?!

495
00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:08.683
Outta how ma...

496
00:23:08.766 --> 00:23:11.144
You know what? I
don't need to know.

497
00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:15.106
Welcome. welcome!

498
00:23:15.189 --> 00:23:18.109
Welcome to my building meeting.

499
00:23:19.276 --> 00:23:20.612
Welcome. all of you.

500
00:23:20.695 --> 00:23:22.572
Let's begin. shall we?

501
00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:26.075
So. I'm Oliver Putnam
and all that hoopla.

502
00:23:28.244 --> 00:23:31.831
And I am thrilled to be
your host at Arconia-Con.

503
00:23:31.914 --> 00:23:35.001
the first ever
tenant-staff mingle fest.

504
00:23:35.084 --> 00:23:36.377
There are no snacks.

505
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.879
Today...

506
00:23:37.962 --> 00:23:40.881
...we're gonna get real about
changes in the building. and...

507
00:23:42.174 --> 00:23:43.468
real about feelings.

508
00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:46.220
Get to it. <i>Temptation
Island</i> starts in ten.

509
00:23:46.303 --> 00:23:47.722
Now. I know it's hard to believe

510
00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:50.975
based on my impeccable
hairline and baby smooth legs.

511
00:23:51.058 --> 00:23:55.563
but I have lived in this
building a long time.

512
00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:57.982
And of course. it's
changed over the years.

513
00:23:58.065 --> 00:24:00.234
that's to be expected.

514
00:24:00.317 --> 00:24:03.738
But there are some changes
that we shouldn't stand for.

515
00:24:03.821 --> 00:24:07.367
And I think I speak for all
of us tenants when I say

516
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:11.204
that we are not gonna sit
back and let our beloved staff

517
00:24:11.287 --> 00:24:14.082
be replaced by
soulless machines.

518
00:24:14.165 --> 00:24:16.918
Yeah! That's right!

519
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:18.670
Now. listen. I love the staff.

520
00:24:18.753 --> 00:24:22.173
but as a man with perpetual.
contagious pink eye...

521
00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:24.509
and I mean it's
really contagious.

522
00:24:24.592 --> 00:24:26.469
A-And I just got it
like two days ago again.

523
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:28.638
and I could blink
too hard and ugh!

524
00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:30.264
I mean. that's it for you. kid.

525
00:24:30.347 --> 00:24:34.435
I like to have my packages
delivered by machines.

526
00:24:34.518 --> 00:24:36.354
I like that I don't have

527
00:24:36.437 --> 00:24:38.564
to make small talk
with the robot.

528
00:24:38.647 --> 00:24:40.066
-Or tip it.
-Yeah.

529
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:43.695
I believe a building is about the people.

530
00:24:43.778 --> 00:24:46.364
That's why I've gotten
to know each of you.

531
00:24:46.447 --> 00:24:48.574
Who...
Who owns a pet.

532
00:24:48.657 --> 00:24:51.369
And which one of you is more
likely to forget their umbrella.

533
00:24:51.452 --> 00:24:52.704
LESTR knows all that.

534
00:24:52.787 --> 00:24:55.331
<i>Umbrella
forgetters. in alphabetical order:</i>

535
00:24:55.414 --> 00:24:57.583
<i>-Sarah Russell. apartment 2B...</i>
-Shut up. Big Hero 6!

536
00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:58.710
I'll say it.

537
00:24:58.793 --> 00:25:01.796
Either this robot
goes. or we do!

538
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.847
Okay. well. how about a little
sing-along to break the tension?

539
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.932
We're not gonna sing for
you. You turned this place

540
00:25:13.015 --> 00:25:14.559
into the murder building!

541
00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.519
Lester the human

542
00:25:16.602 --> 00:25:19.147
would still be our doorman.
if it weren't for you!

543
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.773
Feels like a leap.

544
00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:23.443
But let's get back to the sing-along.
Who knows <i>Send in the Clowns?</i>

545
00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:25.945
The Judy Collins or
the Glynis Johns?

546
00:25:26.028 --> 00:25:27.112
Who do you think?

547
00:25:28.823 --> 00:25:31.617
<i>♪ Don't bother ♪</i>

548
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.163
<i>♪ They're here! ♪</i>

549
00:25:35.246 --> 00:25:37.123
Hey. Charles?

550
00:25:37.206 --> 00:25:39.041
What the hell's going on.
and where's your other shoe?

551
00:25:39.124 --> 00:25:40.668
I don't need my
other shoe to do...

552
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.631
-Move.
-Okay. yeah.

553
00:25:45.714 --> 00:25:47.633
First of all. no.
And whatever this is.

554
00:25:47.716 --> 00:25:50.261
nobody else needs to
see it. Come with me.

555
00:25:50.344 --> 00:25:53.181
Brazzos just became Booze-os.

556
00:25:53.264 --> 00:25:54.891
They're not
taking this seriously.

557
00:25:54.974 --> 00:25:57.393
Okay. uh... uh. let's
get back to the robot. can we?

558
00:25:57.476 --> 00:25:59.520
Yeah. let's get back
to the robot. shall we?

559
00:25:59.603 --> 00:26:01.981
Everybody.

560
00:26:02.064 --> 00:26:05.610
Everyone. P... Please. this
is more than just a building.

561
00:26:05.693 --> 00:26:07.069
this is our community.

562
00:26:07.152 --> 00:26:10.656
This robot is the best thing that
ever happened to this building.

563
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:14.035
In fact. come here. LESTR.

564
00:26:14.118 --> 00:26:16.078
Let's show 'em what
you can do. babe.

565
00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:18.289
Babe?

566
00:26:18.372 --> 00:26:19.999
Babe!

567
00:26:20.082 --> 00:26:21.709
Wait. where'd he go?

568
00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:23.043
Where's my short king?

569
00:26:25.129 --> 00:26:26.839
Oh. sweet Jesus.

570
00:26:26.922 --> 00:26:28.299
He's been taken.

571
00:26:30.634 --> 00:26:33.888
Alright. Mabel. I know I
don't normally share with you

572
00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:35.348
on matters of erotica.

573
00:26:35.431 --> 00:26:37.099
-Yeah. for good reason.
-Yeah.

574
00:26:37.182 --> 00:26:38.976
But last night...

575
00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:42.688
-kissing happened.
-What?

576
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:45.525
It happened in the back
of Sofia's minivan.

577
00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:47.819
you know. which is not easy
because of...

578
00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:50.071
...you know. all the
boys' hockey equipment

579
00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:52.573
and the. uh. old
Lunchable wrappers.

580
00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:54.075
you know. sticking to our skin.

581
00:26:54.158 --> 00:26:57.119
But it was kinda...
kind of a magical night.

582
00:26:57.202 --> 00:26:58.913
Charles!

583
00:26:58.996 --> 00:27:00.915
Has the testosterone
affected your brain?

584
00:27:01.707 --> 00:27:04.502
Yeah. I know about that.
And don't get mad at Oliver.

585
00:27:04.585 --> 00:27:06.420
It was the new trash
guy that outed you.

586
00:27:06.503 --> 00:27:08.256
What?

587
00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:10.174
What happened to Gary?

588
00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:14.011
You see that? I
remembered his name.

589
00:27:14.094 --> 00:27:17.223
Yes. the testosterone is
working. it's making me sharper.

590
00:27:17.306 --> 00:27:20.476
You hooked up with a suspect!
She could be using you.

591
00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.478
Oh. well. if she's using me.

592
00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:25.147
how come I'm the one who came
away with all the information.

593
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.275
and she went away with nothing?

594
00:27:27.358 --> 00:27:28.734
Fine. tell me. What'd you learn?

595
00:27:28.817 --> 00:27:32.446
Oh. I'll tell ya a few.
uh. little tidbits.

596
00:27:32.529 --> 00:27:35.783
Like. uh. well first of all.
that woman can mouth-catch

597
00:27:35.866 --> 00:27:38.536
like a bear going
for upstream salmon.

598
00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:41.038
I don't know what that proves.
but it's going on the board.

599
00:27:41.121 --> 00:27:44.208
What about Tommy the Tongue?
Did you get anything on that?

600
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:47.753
Well. didn't get anything on
Tommy. but I did get a little...

601
00:27:47.836 --> 00:27:49.547
-Charles!
-I was gonna say "tongue".

602
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:50.923
Oh. my God!

603
00:27:51.006 --> 00:27:53.009
-Stop slut-shaming me!
-Great.

604
00:27:53.092 --> 00:27:56.845
So. we are still
exactly nowhere on Tommy.

605
00:27:58.013 --> 00:27:59.515
Alright.

606
00:27:59.598 --> 00:28:02.727
Okay. This is my fault.

607
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.563
Uh. you know. I... I've been
feeling a little down lately.

608
00:28:05.646 --> 00:28:08.733
and I thought the answer might
be for me to find my person.

609
00:28:08.816 --> 00:28:10.526
You know. my Loretta.

610
00:28:10.609 --> 00:28:13.362
But I got carried away.

611
00:28:13.445 --> 00:28:17.033
and I'm sorry I didn't find
out anything about Tommy.

612
00:28:17.116 --> 00:28:18.909
I just wish we could ask Lester.

613
00:28:20.202 --> 00:28:21.662
Maybe we can?

614
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.916
Howard said that Lester's
Arconia paperwork

615
00:28:25.999 --> 00:28:28.711
got uploaded into the robot.

616
00:28:28.794 --> 00:28:30.755
-So. basically. we just have to...
-Oh. no!

617
00:28:30.838 --> 00:28:33.466
...get our hands on the...

618
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:35.009
That was the robot. wasn't it?

619
00:28:37.094 --> 00:28:38.637
What the fuck?!

620
00:28:47.312 --> 00:28:49.022
Two doormen in two weeks.

621
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.026
Babe!

622
00:28:57.573 --> 00:28:59.992
So. update from my corner.

623
00:29:00.075 --> 00:29:02.662
The garbage trucks came.
so any evidence is gone.

624
00:29:02.745 --> 00:29:04.664
Charles hooked up. got
no real information.

625
00:29:04.747 --> 00:29:06.123
and smells like lunch meat.

626
00:29:06.206 --> 00:29:08.959
Yeah. but I've never felt
more connected to my body.

627
00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:11.545
N-Not now. Charles. I've
just been through something.

628
00:29:11.628 --> 00:29:14.674
<i>You</i> have? That robot
was my best friend.

629
00:29:14.757 --> 00:29:17.509
-What about Sevelyn and Gravey?
-Oh. fuck those two.

630
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.596
Everyone says a cat and
dog can't be friends.

631
00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:23.182
but they've made me a
third wheel in my own home.

632
00:29:23.265 --> 00:29:25.267
I've been kicked out of my bed.

633
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.852
I'm on the couch. Charles.

634
00:29:26.935 --> 00:29:29.772
-Well. you're always welcome here.
-We both know that's not true.

635
00:29:30.355 --> 00:29:33.818
After years of being
rejected by you three.

636
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:36.570
that robot gave me a
place in this building.

637
00:29:36.653 --> 00:29:38.530
He made me important.

638
00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.367
I was the lovable despot
I always knew I could be.

639
00:29:43.452 --> 00:29:45.705
But now. LESTR is gone.

640
00:29:45.788 --> 00:29:48.499
He is gone. and ain't
nothin' gonna bring him back.

641
00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:53.796
Oh. look! A new
one's on its way.

642
00:29:53.879 --> 00:29:55.923
And this one
connects to my Gmail.

643
00:29:56.006 --> 00:29:58.551
I gotta go get my charging dock ready.

644
00:29:58.634 --> 00:30:00.761
Oliver! Mabel!

645
00:30:02.137 --> 00:30:04.473
I wanted to thank
you for that meeting.

646
00:30:04.556 --> 00:30:07.309
People downstairs are calling
it "an abject failure."

647
00:30:07.392 --> 00:30:08.686
but I thought it was nice.

648
00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:12.148
Not every day upstairs
people stand up for us.

649
00:30:12.231 --> 00:30:14.400
I wish it had amounted
to more. you know.

650
00:30:14.483 --> 00:30:17.153
Sadly. this building is changing
whether we want it to or not.

651
00:30:17.236 --> 00:30:19.238
True. But on the plus side.

652
00:30:19.321 --> 00:30:20.740
I got to kill a robot.

653
00:30:20.823 --> 00:30:22.366
And go above ground.

654
00:30:22.449 --> 00:30:24.535
So. as a thank you.
I brought you this.

655
00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:31.250
Ah.

656
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:34.086
As you can see. it's a portrait
of Lester. our old doorman.

657
00:30:34.169 --> 00:30:35.546
-Oh. of course.
-Right.

658
00:30:35.629 --> 00:30:37.631
The re... resemblance
is uncanny.

659
00:30:37.714 --> 00:30:39.300
Yeah. Outsider Art
is very pretty...

660
00:30:39.383 --> 00:30:43.721
Plus. his features are made
of the garbage you wanted.

661
00:30:43.804 --> 00:30:45.639
The garbage from the
night Lester died?

662
00:30:45.722 --> 00:30:47.558
Yep.

663
00:30:47.641 --> 00:30:49.018
Enjoy.

664
00:30:49.101 --> 00:30:50.561
But don't throw it out.

665
00:30:50.644 --> 00:30:51.812
I'll know.

666
00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:53.146
Uh...

667
00:30:54.398 --> 00:30:56.484
Sorry. Garbage Lester.

668
00:30:56.567 --> 00:30:59.403
but there might be a clue in here.

669
00:31:00.821 --> 00:31:02.490
Hey! Hey. Miller.

670
00:31:02.573 --> 00:31:04.325
Miller. Miller.

671
00:31:04.408 --> 00:31:06.410
I... I was wondering if
you. by any chance...

672
00:31:06.493 --> 00:31:08.120
Still had the offer?

673
00:31:12.124 --> 00:31:14.001
Maybe a fresh start
would be good.

674
00:31:15.335 --> 00:31:16.462
See ya. Miller. Thanks.

675
00:31:19.423 --> 00:31:22.259
Um. okay. Uh. I have
to tell you something.

676
00:31:22.342 --> 00:31:24.177
uh. but you have to
promise you won't be mad.

677
00:31:25.178 --> 00:31:27.264
I can't find my
phone. Are you mad?

678
00:31:27.347 --> 00:31:29.892
What?! Y-Yes. we are mad.

679
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:31.602
Well. I think I might have
left it in the minivan.

680
00:31:31.685 --> 00:31:33.062
Or Sofia stole it.

681
00:31:33.145 --> 00:31:35.606
Charles. please tell me
you don't have any pictures

682
00:31:35.689 --> 00:31:37.817
of Nicky's body on your
phone from the autopsy.

683
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.361
Oh. shoot. N... Oh.
Yeah... Uh. one.

684
00:31:40.444 --> 00:31:42.279
It was. uh. my screen saver.

685
00:31:42.362 --> 00:31:44.073
Pictures of our murder board?

686
00:31:44.156 --> 00:31:45.783
O-One... Just a few.

687
00:31:45.866 --> 00:31:47.451
One or two... dozen.

688
00:31:47.534 --> 00:31:50.371
Okay. this. um. sucks.

689
00:31:50.454 --> 00:31:52.174
But at least she doesn't
have your passcode.

690
00:31:52.831 --> 00:31:54.416
I did happen to reveal that.

691
00:31:54.499 --> 00:31:56.502
But you know how you're
organically talking

692
00:31:56.585 --> 00:31:58.504
about. like. the number three.

693
00:31:58.587 --> 00:32:01.173
and then you're very
proud of your passcode.

694
00:32:01.256 --> 00:32:03.217
so you just kind
of blurt it out?

695
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.511
Okay. okay. Don't panic.
don't panic. um...

696
00:32:07.346 --> 00:32:08.931
I'm gonna do Find My Phone.

697
00:32:09.014 --> 00:32:11.183
-Oh. we need to find <i>my</i> phone.
-Yeah. I set up my app

698
00:32:11.266 --> 00:32:13.727
so I can locate both
your phones at any time.

699
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.563
Wow. Mabel's obsessed with us.

700
00:32:15.646 --> 00:32:17.064
Okay. it
looks like the phone

701
00:32:17.147 --> 00:32:19.275
is at Sofia's house
on Staten Island.

702
00:32:19.358 --> 00:32:21.318
Okay. it's all very innocent.
I'll just call her up

703
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:23.237
and tell her I'll come
pick up the phone.

704
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.613
plus a little extra.

705
00:32:24.696 --> 00:32:26.156
-Can we not?
-Jesus.

706
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.951
Wait. the phone... The
phone is on the move.

707
00:32:29.034 --> 00:32:31.078
Where's it going?

708
00:32:31.161 --> 00:32:33.247
Oliver. get your car.
we're gonna intercept her.

709
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.957
-Charles. get the Lester garbage face.
-Okay.

710
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.680
-Come on! Put your drink down.
-Alright.

711
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.211
Hurry!

712
00:32:44.633 --> 00:32:46.802
I gotta say. looking through this
garbage feels like a dead-end.

713
00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:48.429
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

714
00:32:48.512 --> 00:32:51.098
Well. just keep looking.
It's the least you can do.

715
00:32:51.181 --> 00:32:54.351
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Sofia. AKA your phone.

716
00:32:54.434 --> 00:32:56.353
is close by now. just
a couple more blocks.

717
00:32:56.436 --> 00:32:57.771
What is she doing in Flatbush?

718
00:32:57.854 --> 00:33:01.108
I don't know. but maybe you could
shop for apartments while we're here.

719
00:33:02.442 --> 00:33:04.778
I saw you take the
offer back. He's moving.

720
00:33:04.861 --> 00:33:06.614
What? How have you not told us?

721
00:33:06.697 --> 00:33:09.158
Right? The only story
you keep to yourself

722
00:33:09.241 --> 00:33:11.035
is the only one we
actually care about.

723
00:33:11.118 --> 00:33:12.745
I always thought they were
gonna have to carry you

724
00:33:12.828 --> 00:33:15.122
-out of that building loafers first.
-Exactly.

725
00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:18.000
You know. I'm... I'm... I'm
just entertaining the idea.

726
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:20.294
Okay? And Mable.
even if I do move.

727
00:33:20.377 --> 00:33:22.379
you're young. you'll forget
about me in a couple of weeks.

728
00:33:22.462 --> 00:33:24.924
No. I wouldn't.
You're my friends.

729
00:33:25.007 --> 00:33:27.259
Well. the first real
friends I've had in a while.

730
00:33:27.342 --> 00:33:29.136
I thought we'd stay
in the building

731
00:33:29.219 --> 00:33:31.555
and continue to make this
podcast something real.

732
00:33:31.638 --> 00:33:34.391
A-Again. I'm just... I'm
just entertaining it.

733
00:33:34.474 --> 00:33:36.018
Hey. look at this.
this is interesting.

734
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:37.644
Is that Lester's handwriting?

735
00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:40.606
Huh. looks like invoices.

736
00:33:40.689 --> 00:33:43.609
Liquor. mixers. a lot
of maraschino cherries.

737
00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:45.361
They're all from the
night of the murders.

738
00:33:45.444 --> 00:33:49.114
Hey. look. all these invoices
are made out to "Tommy."

739
00:33:49.197 --> 00:33:50.282
Could it be?

740
00:33:50.365 --> 00:33:52.618
Yes. the Tongue is implied.

741
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:56.413
And there's an address
there. 4712 Empire Boulevard.

742
00:33:58.415 --> 00:34:01.168
It's leading us right
to where your phone is.

743
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:02.336
We have to go!

744
00:34:04.087 --> 00:34:06.507
-Wait. you just missed our turn!
-No. no. this is a shortcut.

745
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.342
-How do you know that?
-I grew up here.

746
00:34:08.425 --> 00:34:10.552
What?

747
00:34:10.635 --> 00:34:12.096
It's Detective Williams.

748
00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.264
<i>I
just want y'all to know right now.</i>

749
00:34:14.347 --> 00:34:16.433
<i>if I am found dead tomorrow.</i>

750
00:34:16.516 --> 00:34:18.519
<i>it's because I risked my
ass for the three of you.</i>

751
00:34:18.602 --> 00:34:20.521
Well. did you do it? Did
you find Tommy the Tongue?

752
00:34:20.604 --> 00:34:22.773
Sure. I did. But
this is the thing.

753
00:34:22.856 --> 00:34:26.193
Tommy the Tongue is not
a person. it's a company.

754
00:34:26.276 --> 00:34:28.362
And that company is worth
a shit-ton of money.

755
00:34:28.445 --> 00:34:30.572
<i>Except that money was
withdrawn. all of it.</i>

756
00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:32.324
<i>First thing this damn morning.</i>

757
00:34:32.407 --> 00:34:33.409
By who?

758
00:34:33.492 --> 00:34:35.786
No name was attached.
Just an address.

759
00:34:36.495 --> 00:34:40.374
Is the address by any chance
4712 Empire Boulevard?

760
00:34:40.457 --> 00:34:41.709
It sure fucking is.

761
00:34:41.792 --> 00:34:43.544
That's where we are.
that house right there.

762
00:34:43.627 --> 00:34:46.422
<i>Okay. let me be
very. very clear with you right now.</i>

763
00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:48.882
Hear me when I tell you
I would not go in there.

764
00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:50.425
Turn around now!

765
00:34:51.176 --> 00:34:54.179
Hey. Charles. is
that Sofia's minivan?

766
00:34:56.973 --> 00:34:58.517
Oh. God. hide!

767
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.227
<i>So.
you have to ask yourself.</i>

768
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.022
who would want the money
that bad to kill those dudes?

769
00:35:06.733 --> 00:35:08.860
I think
we have an answer.

770
00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:10.946
Their wives.
