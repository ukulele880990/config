That wasn't the deal.
German. was it?!

12
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.878
You can't play me like a fiddle. man!

13
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.638
How are we doing this?
Where's the stuff?!

14
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.758
What do you mean. no stuff?!
How’s that. no stuff? Hey!

15
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.238
Right... So where's the stuff at?

16
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.878

[IN GYPSY]
<i>Mother-fucking asshole!</i>

18
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.998
- <i>What is it. man? What'd he say?</i>
- <i>Just like we thought. he lied to us!</i>

19
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.998
<i>Said he'd hold on to it.
or else he’ll clue Jartea in!</i>

<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

Come on. call those two.
we need to go!

22
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.718
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- <i>I want to come too!</i>

23
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.278
<i>You’re not going anywhere!
Get back inside!</i>

24
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.478
- <i>But...</i>
- <i>Are you deaf or what?! Now!</i>

25
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.440
- <i>You heard him. bro! Go inside!</i>
- <i>But I can help...</i>

26
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.640
- Come on. man!
- What?

27
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.278
- Man. your dad used to be a cowboy!
- Yeah. colonel sheriff. shit you not!

28
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.798
- With money in his pockets!
- Living large!

29
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.278
- Catch!
- What the...! Auch!

30
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.558
- Man. I'll...!
- Catch. bro...!

31
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.560
- Stop. bro...!
- Man. you suck!... No. no. don't!

32
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.598
- Let me go...!
- Say it! Say. I suck!

33
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.478
- Shut up!
- Man! Klutz!

34
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.678
Quit it!
I'll shove that can up your..

35
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.838
It’s natural. bro. no E-numbers.

36
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.160
- Grass!
- Yeah. all G's all the way!

37
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.678
You smoked in Bucharest. did'ya?
Instead of Coke?

38
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.878
I did heavier stuff too. but...

39
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.920
...not since I moved to Brasov...

40
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.838
It's done. Dusted.

41
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.120
I wish our folks smoked up too!
It'd loosen them up some.

42
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.198
Sorry.

43
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.678
The shit my dad’s got pent up inside
could blow up a continent!

44
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.078
Let's sell your dad to the Americans!

45
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.878
We’d be living like kings in Miami
on the reward!

46
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.040
Would you wanna live somewhere else?

47
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.078
Sometimes I think I would.

48
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.158
Some place where...

49
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.398
Dunno... Where you can be yourself.
You know?

50
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.558
Where you don’t have to hide.

51
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.558
What do you have to hide.
aside from your pea brain?

52
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.040
Hey! Careful!

53
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.440
Go on. for real. what?

54
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.398
I need to borrow your phone.
for a minute tops.

55
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.440
I won’t steal it or anything.

56
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.840
Take this.

57
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.760
Hello? It's Cristi.
Write this down fast!

58
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.678
Silver BMW... plates P2421AH.

59
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.360
I'm at the gas station
in Lower Timis. Yeah. the big one.

60
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.360
We've got this guy in the trunk.
I think they wanna kill him.

61
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.040
Really now. what the fuck. Filip?!
It's messed up... what happened!

62
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.198
- Why?
- How the fuck can you ask why?!

63
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.040
This didn't happen! OK?

64
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.920
Is someone coming?

65
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.920
- Man. is it your dad?
- Shut the fuck up!

66
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.998
The air up here man. fuck yeah. man!

67
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.918
Go on. get him out!

68
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.200
- Should I untie his legs?
- Do you plan on carrying his ass?

69
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.998
They're gonna shoot you!
Go on...

70
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.040
I’ve got a gun on my belt. Got it?

71
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.960
Walk. you fucker!

72
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.318
We're ready.

73
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.600
Get out of the way.
Move your ass aside!

74
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.600
Let's go!

75
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.440
What the fuck is this?!
Are you mad?!

76
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.400
He's coming after us!
Turn that off! This way! Come on!

77
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.720
Horia?

78
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.640
Let's go!

79
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.718
All of this stays between us. OK?

80
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.960
- Swear it. bro!!
- I swear. OK.

81
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.400
Let's go!

82
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.278
- All done?
- Yeah.

83
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.920
- Filip?
- I let him sleep a while longer.

84
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.758
- Good morning.
- Morning.

85
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.078
Good morning.
Did you sleep OK?

86
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.680
Enjoy.

87
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.558
I’m not coming home after school.
so you know.

88
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.000
I’m going up to visit mom.

89
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.760
- Weren’t you just there last week?
- So?

90
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.838
You can’t go see her whenever
you want. she's in jail!

91
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.758
- Yeah. thanks to you!
- Filip...

92
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.720
And anyway. I’m allowed
two more visits this month.

93
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.878
Look. I was thinking... Why don't
we all get away for the weekend?

94
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.438
We had a deal. Filip.
You see her every other week.

95
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.880
Those people have rules.

96
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.080
I've already scheduled it.

97
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.640
Later!

98
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.238
I know it's hard for you.
You miss her. I get it.

99
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.880
But taking it out on us
doesn't do anyone any good.

100
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.718
Radu Diaconu's here.
Wants a word with you.

101
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.760
- Radu Diaconu?
- Yes. he's downstairs. just come.

102
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.800
- Morning. Radu.
- Morning.

103
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.318
What's up?

104
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.118
I've just come from the cabin.
our place in the woods. you know...

105
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.718
Yes. I know.

106
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.198
I found four dead people there.

107
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.038
- Didn't know where to go first...
- Back up. what?! Four dead people?!

108
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.678
Yeah. dead! Splayed out horizontally.
with a peephole in the head.

109
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.998
not alive. not for a while.

110
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.478
- Sorry.
- Did you call the police?

111
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.160
Of course.

112
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.798
What's your take?

113
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.878
It went down around 11 PM.

114
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.838
The shooter had excellent aim.
I think he's a marksman.

115
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.040
We're waiting on positive ID's
for the victims.

116
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.278
- And the weapon?
- Hasn't turned up yet.

117
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.040
One of the victims had a Glock.
Hasn't been fired.

118
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.438
And the car?

119
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.118
We don't have a match yet.
I radioed it in.

120
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.398
Did you find any
trace evidence inside?

121
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.478
We'd be lucky to find anything.
with the state it's in.

122
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.638
Maybe that's why it's been set
on fire.

123
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.078
- Let's check inside. all the same.
- Quite right. we'll look everywhere.

124
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.880
OK.

125
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.000
Fine. Bye.

126
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.598
- Hey.
- <i>What's up? Where are you?</i>

127
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.718
- At home.
- <i>So. are you coming or what?</i>

128
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.998
- I'm on my way. leaving now.
- <i>Look. your dad came by the house.</i>

129
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.200
Hang on. man! The cops are here...

130
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.598
- I've no idea what went down.
- Horia? Hello? Horia?

131
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.838
Hello?!

132
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.118
I don't know who they are
or why they were near the cabin.

133
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.638
We don't go up there
that often anyway.

134
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.118
Our son Horia is there a lot.
He's training.

135
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.678
For the motocross championships.

136
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.598
Yeah. So this morning I had stuff
to do at the cabin.

137
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.678
I looked for the key.
but it wasn't in its usual spot.

138
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.198
And I went anyway.
Would've changed the cylinder.

139
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.120
It's in my rain coat.

140
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.958
I forgot to take it out.

141
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.398
- Again?!
- Yeah.

142
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.158
So. when did you go there last?

143
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.240
Uh... The day before yesterday.
Right. dad?

144
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.958
Can you take me? I missed the bus.

145
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.560
You're not going anywhere today!
I'll write you a note.

146
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.998
Yeah! Are you slow or what?
Shot straight in the head.

147
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.678
- Give me a break!
- You think I'm making this up?

148
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.198
Wanna bet?

149
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.198
- Zamfir killed them. guys!
- I bet!

150
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.518
He let one rip and gassed them all!

151
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.518
Or Horia! With his bike!

152
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.798
Fess up. did your boyfriend’s
mofo-cycle sputter out?

153
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.078
- What did you say?
- He's mad now! This is gonna be good!

154
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.958
You heard me.
Want me to talk slower?

155
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.760
Were you dropped on your head?

156
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.638
Chill. bro! Leave it!

157
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.118
- Stop. man! Leave it!
- Chill. chill!

158
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.438
Briefing the press?
Was that necessary?

159
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.678
I know
it’s not something common. but...

160
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.798
<i>They would've been
all over us anyway.</i>

161
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.198
<i>We're getting off easy this way.
Keeping it orderly. official.</i>

162
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.878
OK. But do remember
what we talked about.

163
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.718
I'll only head this up till you find
someone else to take over.

164
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.918
<i>Let's see this thing through for now.</i>

165
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.720
Fine. we'll see. I have to go.
there's a development here.

166
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.198
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Laurentiu Codrea. DIICOT.

167
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.398
- Barbu. Homicide.
- Agent Camelia Badoi.

168
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.320
They won't even let us do our job.
look at them striding in like...

169
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.638
Laurentiu Codrea. DIICOT.
Who's the DA?

170
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.840
I am. Elena Zamfir.

171
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.558
Agent Camelia Badoi.

172
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.198
I'm curious
what brings you down here.

173
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.798
We got an anonymous tip last night.
We had to follow up on it.

174
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.758
- Gloves?
- Over there.

175
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.400
Thanks.

176
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.878
About the car...

177
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.278
It's registered
to a Stadian Ceprache.

178
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.360
Just like we thought.
The Jartea clan.

179
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.400
Now I get it.

180
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.920
One of the victims
is Stadian Ceprache. am I right?

181
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.518
- Yes.
- And the other three men?

182
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.680
From the clan too. are they?

183
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.598
Are you OK?

184
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.440
Sure? Camelia...

185
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.160
Hey. hey. hey!

186
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.040
You need to leave the perimeter.

187
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.278
Sorry.

188
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.998
You won't mind us
taking a DNA sample. right?

189
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.200
You know the drill.

190
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.198
Getting back
to ID-ing the victims...

191
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.440
Let's take them one by one.

192
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.918
The victims' names... I don't know
their addresses by heart.

193
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.080
but I can email them to you later.

194
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.640
- Was this "Cristian Iuga" police?
- No.

195
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.398
I said. no.

196
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.278
I'd like to know what this anonymous
caller said last night.

197
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.078
If you've got further questions.
you'd best talk to Mr. Manolescu.

198
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.438
I'll be addressing the press
this evening.

199
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.558
I think all our lives would be easier
if you guys answered by then.

200
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.160
Otherwise. I'll have no choice
but make conjectures. in public.

201
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.760
Really now. Filip...
Why would you do that?

202
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.038
- She was rude.
- You can't hit girls. No matter what!

203
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.678
We'll continue this at home. OK?

204
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.638
Now you get back to class
and apologize!

205
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.600
Deal? Do this. please. Go on.

206
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.280
Horia!

207
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.520
- What's up. man?
- Nothing.

208
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.400
Why didn't you call back?
I thought something happened.

209
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:42.118
To me? It looks like
you're the one with the story.

210
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.560
- Who beat you up?
- Just some guy. never mind.

211
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.158
- You didn't breathe a word. I hope.
- No. What was the deal with the cops?

212
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.920
- What did they want?
- To talk to my old man.

213
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.358
- Someone set the car on fire.
- What do you mean?

214
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.198
- Didn't you watch the news?
- No.

215
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.398
The car. Horia. It burnt up.
That means that guy's still alive.

216
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.478
- What if he comes after us?
- He doesn't know who we are.

217
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.440
- He didn't see our faces.
- Not your face. he didn't.

218
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.038
What if we just told them
what we saw?

219
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.278
No way!
Don't you even go there.

220
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.798
I could tell Elena we snuck out
for a bike ride in the woods...

221
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.758
Sure. and then we went to the cabin.
took our clothes off. and...

222
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.998
They'll find DNA. traces...
They'll find out everything.

223
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.438
Even if they don’t. it won't take
my dad long to figure it out.

224
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.198
- Why are you so worked up?
- Because I'm not queer!

225
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.998
- What's that have to do with...?
- It does! You are. I'm not. got it?

226
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.920
Are we clear?!

227
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.960
You won't tell anyone. right?

228
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.520
That's the guy.

229
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.398
Are you sure?

230
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.560
Positive. He asked
to borrow my phone.

231
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.880
OK. I want you to tell me
how it all went down.

232
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.638
He said he needed to make a call.

233
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.518
He went into the men's room.
made the call there...

234
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.158
I don't know who to or what was
said. I didn't go in after him.

235
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.278
Then. he came out.
gave me my phone back.

236
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.400
and that was it.

237
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.638
- We'll be keeping your phone.
- How come?

238
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.118
No way. It's brand new.
I only bought it a month ago.

239
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.678
I have a ton of photos on it!

240
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.720
You'll get a voucher.
so you can get a new one.

241
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.760
Sorry. Can you step out for a sec?

242
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.278
That number the victim dialed...
It traced back to the DIICOT.

243
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.638
- Of course it did.
- You already knew that?

244
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.320
No.

245
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.278
"The Lord is my shepherd."

246
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.198
"I shall not want."

247
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.998
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.""

248
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.520
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters."

249
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.358
"Thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me."

250
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.880
"Thou anointest my head with oil."

251
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.480
"And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord for ever."

252
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.240
It's them. My sons.

253
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.000
Stadian and Giani Ceprache.

254
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.520
[IN GYPSY]
<i>Let's go.</i>

255
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.480
Did something happen?

256
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.240
Simona. may I come in?

257
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.398
[IN GYPSY]
<i>Look where following Jartea got them!</i>

258
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.240
<i>At the morgue!</i>

259
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.040
<i>Listen here.</i>

260
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.838
<i>You've no business going there.</i>

261
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.718
<i>You're choosing a different life.
staying in school.</i>

262
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.240
<i>making something of yourself!
You have a parish and everything!</i>

263
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.238
<i>Know this. Aleodor! I'll kill you
myself if you don't mind me!</i>

264
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.880
<i>I will too. rather than stand by
while Jartea kills you first!</i>

265
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.398
Our main suspect: Nicu Jartea.

266
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.118
Sorry. I mean Nicu Jartea. Esquire.

267
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.158
He joined the Bar in '98. and retired
two years later to go into business.

268
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.278
Meaning drugs. prostitution.
human trafficking.

269
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.278
He'd call it providing jobs
for the Roma community.

270
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.478
- What does the DIICOT have on him?
- More than us. I guess.

271
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.318
But I'm not sure
how much they're willing to share.

272
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.238
He's a hard man to reach anyway.

273
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.798
Everyone clams up
when it comes to Nicu Jartea.

274
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.518
In a nutshell: he's a chancer
who knows which palms to grease.

275
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.638
We don't question him first.

276
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.878
We start with the victims' families.
see what we can dig up

277
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.480
- ...that we can use against him.
- Right.

278
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.558
- We have another problem.
- I'm listening.

279
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.958
That crazy broad called
a press conference.

280
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.518
She threatens to out our man
unless we give her intel.

281
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:49.478
- The crazy broad is DA Elena Zamfir?
- The one and only.

282
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.678
The Elena Zamfir I know is a pro.

283
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.198
She'd never make public statements
she couldn't prove.

284
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.238
That's not what I heard about her.

285
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.758
Maybe she'll manage to get herself
sacked. like in Bucharest.

286
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.358
But not before wrecking the three
years of work we put into this.

287
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.358
Since when do we just trust
what the media tells us?

288
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.238
Elena Zamfir wasn't fired.
She left on her own.

289
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.718
Things were a bit more nuanced
in Bucharest.

290
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.358
Say she does let something slip.
What about Cristi and his family?

291
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.198
Camelia. I know this is
personal for you.

292
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.918
And I am truly sorry
about what happened.

293
00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.680
But we all knew going in that this
op came with some pretty big risks.

294
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.198
Cristi did too.

295
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.238
Still. don't you think we should
come through for our own?

296
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.078
Cristi has a one-year-old baby!

297
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.638
If Jartea finds out he was a CI.
what happens to his family?

298
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.278
Or do we chalk them up to risks too?

299
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.920
Laur. give us a minute!

300
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.800
Laur!

301
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.878
You can bring someone along at the
5 PM press conference. if you want.

302
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.998
Your new boss arrives on Monday!

303
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.360
I'd like him to find this place
in top shape.

304
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.038
The work was clean.
He set the car on fire.

305
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.278
There was no trace DNA. and as far as
suspects or valid lead. we have none.

306
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.278
So what do we tell the press today?

307
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.678
That it's too early in the inquiry
to reach relevant insights.

308
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.278
Which is the truth.

309
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.838
It is. only no one cares about that.
not when dealing with four bodies.

310
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.998
- People want information.
- Yes. Barbu.

311
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.718
<i>We found tire tracks made yesterday
by a motorbike around the cabin.</i>

312
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.798
- <i>It rained non stop the night before.</i>
- Bring Horia in.

313
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.838
<i>All right.</i>

314
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.040
- Were the DIICOT there?
- You bet. A scene for the ages.

315
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.998
I'm going to be honest with you.
I want you to see this case through.

316
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.918
No way. We've talked about this.

317
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.918
Sure. only I can't remember
your reasons.

318
00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.438
My reason is I have other priorities.

319
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.798
We've made some decisions.
my family and I.

320
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.278
Come on. Elena.
this one fits you like a glove.

321
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.838
You know how these things work.
you know the DIICOT.

322
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.360
How many people can match
your experience?

323
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.440
He pulled me off the case.

324
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.880
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.120
Take a seat.

326
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.800
Hiya!

327
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.038
How are you? OK?

328
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.678
I froze when I saw the news.
Four people shot in the head.

329
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.318
And to think.
how close that was to your place!

330
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.718
And I'm in here.
powerless to do anything!

331
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.598
I'm fine. mom.

332
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.280
What happened to your eye?

333
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.838
Nothing. I'm OK.

334
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.838
- You be careful now. Filip.
- For a while at least. OK?

335
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.118
What's going on with you?
How's it... going?

336
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.038
I can't wait to get out.

337
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.638
- To get everything sorted and...
- It's only been a year though.

338
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.278
- You've got...
- 6 years in all. 3 for good behavior.

339
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.280
I want to know about you!

340
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.000
- And them. how are they?
- OK.

341
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.360
And school?
Have you made any new friends?

342
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.400
A few.

343
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.440
How about a girlfriend?

344
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.360
Go on. tell me!

345
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.640
There has to be someone you like!

346
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.120
Filip. you're seventeen!
There's no shame in liking someone.

347
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.240
I do like someone.

348
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.918
- A classmate of yours?
- No.

349
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.000
Is she older then?

350
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.718
What's her name?

351
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.600
Come on. please. tell me!
It'll be our secret. I promise!

352
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.400
Horia.

353
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.038
What about Horia?

354
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.960
His name's Horia.

355
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.720
- Are you saying...?
- I don't know. mom! I don't!

356
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.600
Maybe it's a phase.
I mean. I hope it is.

357
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.998
Filip. don't get me wrong.

358
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.838
What I mean is...
you'd be better off not being...

359
00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.320
...different.

360
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.318
My only fear is that others
will cause you trouble.

361
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.638
That you'll be judged.
shunned. rejected...

362
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.400
That you'll have
to hide all your life.

363
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.080
But. no matter what. you're my child
and I love you. Don't ever forget!

364
00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.520
I love you too!

365
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.158
The Police are looking for you.
Any idea why?

366
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.518
If you did something dumb.
you're better off telling me now.

367
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.798
I've no clue! I didn't do anything!

368
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.358
If I hear differently. I'll kick your
ass into next Tuesday! Got it?

369
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.080
Let's go! They're waiting.

370
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.078
- Hey. Filip!
- Is Elena in?

371
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:14.118
- She's very busy.
- It's urgent. I want to talk to her.

372
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.720
- One sec.
- Thanks!

373
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.920
Sorry. Mrs. Elena... Filip's here.

374
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.638
Hi.

375
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.280
Hi.

376
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.398
Filip. what happened to your eye?

377
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.478
It's nothing... Someone hit me.

378
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.518
I want to tell you...
I saw something.

379
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.318
I mean. I saw someone... and...

380
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.478
- It's for you. ma'am!
- It can wait. I'll call them back.

381
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.600
It's a woman. Says it's important.
She mentioned the investigation.

382
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.640
I'll be right back.

383
00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.960
Hello?

384
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.880
Hello.

385
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.238
- Good day!
- I'll need you to wait a bit.

386
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.360
Something urgent's come up.
I'm heading out for ten minutes.

387
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.318
- Good day. ma'am!
- Same to you. Mr. Barbu!

388
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.680
- Can I get you a coffee?
- Yes. thank you.

389
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.318
- I take it this is confidential.
- Yes.

390
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.198
OK.

391
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.758
I want to ask you not to publicize
Cristi's part in all of this.

392
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.678
I assume you'll also tell me
why I shouldn't.

393
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.638
You were right.

394
00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.718
Cristi wasn't a cop. he was the mole
we had inside the clan.

395
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.718
I was the one he called last night.

396
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.638
At 9:47 PM. using a borrowed phone.
from a gas station in Lower Timis.

397
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.398
He told me they were driving out
to kill someone.

398
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.200
There was a man in their trunk.

399
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.280
- Did he say who?
- He didn't know.

400
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.438
Who else knows about this?

401
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.320
Laurentiu. that's it.
He was his handler.

402
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.960
So then why contact you.
instead of Codrea?

403
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.760
Because I was the one who recruited
him and got him involved in this.

404
00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.838
He had a wife
and a one-year-old baby.

405
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.480
If Jartea finds out he was a snitch.
you know what'll happen to them.

406
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.958
- You're here to spill the beans?
- I didn't tell anything. Trust me!

407
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.918
Then what are you doing here?

408
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.038
I did want to tell her I saw the guy.

409
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.318
- But I didn't get the chance to.
- What?!

410
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:33.758
The guy from the woods. the killer!
And I think he saw me too.

411
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.438
Shit! Did he follow you?

412
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.318
I don't know. I ran like hell
right after I got off.

413
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.878
- We have to tell them!
- Fucking drop it!

414
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.520
We decided we weren't gonna tell.
You promised me!

415
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.960
Sorry. Filip.
I'm all yours now. tell me...

416
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.358
It's nothing.
We can talk about it at home.

417
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.838
- Sure?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

418
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.558
I'll let Silviu know you're here.
He'll come pick you up. OK?

419
00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.798
- Dana. can you call him. please?
- Sure.

420
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.558
Also. tell Ristea
I'll be 10 minutes late.

421
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.358
Horia. let's go.
Do your folks know you're here?

422
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.998
- Yes.
- Great.

423
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.520
- Bye!
- Later!

424
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.078
I won't beat around the bush. I know
you were at the cabin yesterday.

425
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.880
We found tire tracks.
We know you rode your bike there.

426
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.318
- He's gonna kill me.
- Who will?

427
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.998
My dad. I went there to train.
He doesn't know.

428
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.758
He won't let me train
in the woods at night.

429
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.440
If he finds out...
Please. don't tell him!

430
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:56.838
- What time did you get to the cabin?
- Around 4 or 5.

431
00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:02.678
- And what time did you leave?
- It was 8. or half past.

432
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.680
- And you didn't see anything?
- Nope. nothing.

433
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.478
You didn't see anyone.
or run into anyone?

434
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.000
No.

435
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:19.880
- Sorry. Mr. Barbu's here for you.
- Wait here for me a sec.

436
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.878
- A word. about Cristodor Ceprache.
- Yes.

437
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.878
He was at the morgue.
to ID his sons.

438
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.358
We let him go. He didn't get home.

439
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.318
- We're looking for him.
- OK.

440
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.038
- And tomorrow morning?
- Like we said. 6 AM.

441
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.798
At least 20 uniforms. Turn the woods
inside out and find me that gun!

442
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.280
Understood.

443
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.678
Hello. I am Elena Zamfir.
I'm a forensic district attorney.

444
00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.638
Today at 7:30 AM.
in the Rasnov area in Brasov county.

445
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.838
four dead bodies were discovered.
all Roma men.

446
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.678
aged between 30 and 40.
presenting with fatal gunshot wounds.

447
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.678
The Coroner's preliminary findings

448
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.238
put the time of death
at 11 PM yesterday

449
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.838
and show the same gun was used
on all four men.

450
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.478
If you have any questions...

451
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.638
Letitia Popa.
with the <i>Voice of Brasov</i>.

452
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.198
Can you tell us who the victims are?

453
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.318
For reasons related to our inquiry.

454
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.878
I can't divulge that information
at this time.

455
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.478
Dan Popescu.
with <i>The Truth </i>newspaper.

456
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.718
Did the victims have
a criminal record?

457
00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.598
No comment. Any other questions?

458
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.598
You took this case after a sudden
break in an outstanding career path

459
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.838
with the Homicide Department
in Bucharest. Care to comment?

460
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.760
<i>I intend to solve this case.</i>

461
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.278
<i>I'd rather focus on the present
and the future of this inquiry.</i>

462
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.718
- <i>A follow-up. if I may...</i>
- <i>By all means.</i>

463
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.198
<i>Our sources tell us</i>

464
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.518
one of the victims made
an emergency call that night.

465
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.398
Have you managed to identify
the person he was calling?

466
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:05.320
Could the man who telephoned have
been in fact an undercover agent?

467
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.438
If you have information
that might help our inquiry.

468
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.158
I'm at your disposal.

469
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.918
Otherwise. I'm afraid your sources
are quite simply making things up.

470
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.278
Set up a charity. if you enjoy
backing such creative people!

471
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.798
To return to the facts in question:
if anyone's seen or knows anything

472
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.558
that could help further the inquiry.

473
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.160
I ask them to contact us
without delay! Thank you.

474
00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.080
Nice suit.

475
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.280
Did you come from a charity ball?

476
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.598
- No. the press conference.
- You'd better moth-proof it.

477
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.918
Seeing how business
is going lately...

478
00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.638
That shipment fell off
the face of the earth!

479
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.958
And I lost four men! Four men. dead!

480
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.038
Four!

481
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:42.120
I'll find out what happened. even if
I have to kill ten more men myself!

482
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.760
But what do we do until then?

483
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.120
Put on the brakes?

484
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.120
I mean.
just until things cool down a bit...

485
00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:01.078
- I say we cancel the next shipment.
- Nicu. I don't care about your drama.

486
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.158
I didn't fly in all the way
from Palermo for a therapy session!

487
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.480
If the next shipment doesn't get
there. I'll be coming after you!

488
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.360
What time is it?

489
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.040
Almost two.

490
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.760
What a day!

491
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.838
Filip came round the office today.
but we didn't get a chance to talk.

492
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.240
- What was that black eye about?
- You didn't even talk about that?

493
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.078
He slapped a girl in school.
then another boy punched him.

494
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.678
What?! Why would he hit a girl?

495
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.038
I don't know. he wouldn’t say.

496
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.360
She apparently did something
to set him off.

497
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.838
- But he's not like that.
- We still don’t know what he's like!

498
00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.480
We've only been in his life a year.

499
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:41.438
- Silviu...
- Yeah. I know. I watched the news.

500
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.080
I'm sorry.
I'd have liked to tell you myself.

501
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.398
Ristea hounded me. but aside
from that. I thought about it.

502
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.438
I really want this case!
And that journalist provoked me...

503
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.998
Do you remember what we said
before we left Bucharest?

504
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.278
Did we start making
unilateral decisions?

505
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.800
I know. you're right.

506
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.318
But this is different.
After 8 years in Homicide.

507
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.438
this isn't how my career
should've ended. I deserve this.

508
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.038
You promised you'd look after Filip
while your sister's in jail!

509
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.758
Right? Do you think this kid
will raise himself?

510
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.720
- This case is a temporary thing.
- Really?! Temporary. is it?

511
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.638
Maybe that's how I should've answered
when you had me sell my gym

512
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.638
and move away!
How about that?

513
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.398
"No dear. I'm not selling. or moving
because it's all temporary for you!"

514
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.678
If your presence here
weren't temporary

515
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.158
maybe Filip wouldn't feel
like going to see his mom so often!

516
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.920
Or hitting girls at school.

517
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.680
Filip. come on. move it!

518
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.560
Bro! Fuck it! They're here!

519
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.398
- Horia. over here!
- What?

520
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.718
It's here. we're good.

521
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.680
Come on! Let's go! That way!

522
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.558

for lacking an in-house division

523
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.200

and judiciary policing.

524
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:42.158

531

Thank you.

533
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.118
Well. to hear that one could think
what I'm best at is tourism.

534
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:23.038
I'll spare you the fancy speech and
just share my strongest conviction.

535
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:28.158
Which is that teamwork is key
to achieving greatness.

536
00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.760
