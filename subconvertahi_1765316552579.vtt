00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.086
Murphy. join t' party. huh?

3
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.967
What's wrong?

4
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.177
All you guys having a good time?

5
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.846
You gotta let it go. man.
There's good that came out of this.

6
00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:56.808
Yeah. we used him.
then we got him killed.

7
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.644
No. we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

8
00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.105
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

9
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.399
Look on the bright side. huh?

10
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:10.322
Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

11
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.826
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

12
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.245
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

13
00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:23.626
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

14
00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:27.297
Finally. the Colombian government
had to react.

15
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.425
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

16
00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.345
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100.000 REWARD

17
00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:38.599
Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

18
00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:42.354
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

19
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.856
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US.

20
00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.441
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

21
00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:50.778
This made all the difference in the world.

22
00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:53.781
If you were a narco in Colombia.

23
00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:56.701
jail time meant banging girls.
watching movies.

24
00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.494
hanging with the fellas...

25
00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:02.581
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

26
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.500
It was a fucking joke.

27
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.086
Back home.
it was a whole different deal.

28
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.965
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

29
00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.345
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day.
just like every other loser.

30
00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:16.971
a fucking nightmare.

31
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.892
Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.

32
00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:50.123
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

33
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.611
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

34
00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.239
- With our help. you will.
- Oh. that's right.

35
00:03:58.323 --> 00:03:59.824
Gringos to the rescue.

36
00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:03.661
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

37
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:08.207
One man with helicopters. airplanes.
vehicles. planned escape routes.

38
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:11.056
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money.

39
00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.546
- men. weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

40
00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.675
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

41
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.178
Help us catch him.

42
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:24.265
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

43
00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.933
Let me take care of that.

44
00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.896
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

45
00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.489
Escobar will not go lightly.

46
00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:44.952
He will make Colombia bleed.

47
00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:51.584
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

48
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:56.255
You make the mistakes.
and then you preach solidarity?

49
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.674
- Shut up. fag.
- What the fuck. Carlos?

50
00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:01.844
Why are you always defending him?

51
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.888
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

52
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:07.766
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

53
00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:13.731
Gentlemen...

54
00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:18.861
I suggest we form another organization

55
00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:22.365
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

56
00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:24.658
Like John Lennon said.

57
00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.204
- "Come together. brothers and sisters..."
- Stop that fag shit right now.

58
00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:31.416
So Jorge...

59
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:33.543
what will we call it?

60
00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:37.880
First. "Death to Kidnappers."
then "the Extraditables."

61
00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:43.302
Once again. the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.

62
00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:47.014
But it was not quite like
"one for all. and all for one."

63
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.769
It was more like each man for himself.

64
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.271
Next!

65
00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:57.483
Gacha. being Gacha. decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

66
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:01.613
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- Fire!

67
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.949
So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

68
00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:05.866
Next!

69
00:06:06.075 --> 00:06:09.828
Lehder. being Lehder. got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

70
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:13.291
The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

71
00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.753
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

72
00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:19.964
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

73
00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.883
I mean. all of our problems...

74
00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:27.263
are because of those imperialist gringos!

75
00:06:27.472 --> 00:06:29.890
No. stay there... stay there.

76
00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:33.936
As for the Ochoa brothers.
they went with a fancy PR firm

77
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.565
and got ripped off because. well...
that's what PR agencies do.

78
00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:39.775
"Better a grave in Colombia

79
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.319
than a grave in the United States."

80
00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:45.364
No. I've got it. Fabio. I've got it.
Let's see...

81
00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:49.994
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

82
00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.537
- What do you think?
- I love it.

83
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:53.956
Very good.

84
00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.460
And for $50.000 more.
we'll make your logo.

85
00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.545
Done.

86
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.635
By the way.
here's the logo $50.000 got you.

87
00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:09.388
In the upcoming presidential election.
extradition became the defining issue

88
00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:10.806
amongst the candidates.

89
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.476
Those the narcos could buy.
they bought.

90
00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:15.769
The ones they could scare.
they scared.

91
00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:18.731
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

92
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.818
And so. unable to buy him
and unable to scare him.

93
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:26.113
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery.

94
00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:28.115
and he wrote Galán a letter.

95
00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:33.912
"And to conclude. I want
to express my most energetic protest

96
00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.708
over the improper interference
of North America

97
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.669
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

98
00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:41.795
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

99
00:07:42.714 --> 00:07:44.507
He's got some balls.

100
00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:46.300
Escobar is shameless.

101
00:07:46.384 --> 00:07:50.971
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency. Mr. Galán.

102
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:54.099
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States.

103
00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:57.061
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

104
00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.022
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

105
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.983
My campaign manager.
Dr. Gaviria.

106
00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:05.528
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

107
00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:09.615
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle.

108
00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:12.410
when clearly.
they're losing a war.

109
00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.454
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

110
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.834
If you speak in favor
of extradition. you will be their puppet.

111
00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:23.254
and that will be your death sentence.

112
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:27.592
I don't care about the Americans. but I am
still going to support extradition.

113
00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:30.928
Besides. if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country.

114
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.346
then let them take them.

115
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.931
Since he couldn't get to Galán.

116
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.768
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

117
00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.687
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

118
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:41.897
if no judge was willing to apply it.

119
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.569
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

120
00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:49.905
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States.

121
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:53.367
know we. the Extraditables.
will pass judgment on you

122
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:56.036
and bring a sentence far harsher."

123
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.414
The judges were so scared and intimidated

124
00:08:58.497 --> 00:09:01.250
that special court procedures
had to be created.

125
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.795
For the first time
in the history of Colombia.

126
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.756
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

127
00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:08.591
Defendants. please rise.

128
00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:14.138
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

129
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:21.145
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

130
00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:24.565
Despite his threats.
many brave men defied him.

131
00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:30.195
And true to form.
when the pen failed...

132
00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:32.281
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

133
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.290
In light of this terrorism.
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

134
00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:45.210
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority. right?

135
00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:46.712
Well. guess again.

136
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.675
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

137
00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:54.386
All due respect. but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

138
00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:58.182
We got FARC. we got M-19.
we got EPL. we got ELN.

139
00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.810
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

140
00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:04.647
Sorry. Agent Peña. but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems.

141
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.024
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

142
00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.028
Communists. Remember them?

143
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:15.533
With Reagan in the White House.
it was hard to forget.

144
00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:16.659
In his words:

145
00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:19.871
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

146
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:24.249
The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing. always had been.

147
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:27.879
In Hollywood. he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

148
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.964
In Washington.
he created the Reagan Doctrine.

149
00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:33.718
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

150
00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:37.262
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

151
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:40.933
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world.

152
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.184
you'd better be chasing reds.

153
00:10:42.393 --> 00:10:45.771
Ambassador. if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets.

154
00:10:45.855 --> 00:10:47.815
the Colombians will get Escobar.

155
00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:50.943
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

156
00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.654
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

157
00:10:53.738 --> 00:10:58.826
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

158
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.162
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker. and as such.

159
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:07.209
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

160
00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:12.464
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

161
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:14.174
Let the Colombians get him.

162
00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:18.345
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100.000

163
00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:21.599
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah. it's a fucking joke.

164
00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:23.434
That's about what he spends on shoes.
isn't it?

165
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.604
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

166
00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.105
So what do we do now?

167
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.691
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

168
00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:35.362
It's true.
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

169
00:11:35.446 --> 00:11:38.198
But delivered into the right hands.
it could make a difference.

170
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:43.036
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia.
honorable men.

171
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.000
But the head of counternarcotics.
General Jaramillo. wasn't one of 'em.

172
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.213
And as such.
he was exactly what we needed.

173
00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:55.967
Thank you for seeing me. General.

174
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.676
You're welcome.

175
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.346
Listen. I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

176
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.810
With all due respect. General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

177
00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:09.062
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

178
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.982
Well. I don't want him to follow.

179
00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:13.484
I want him to lead.

180
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.574
Go ahead.

181
00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:23.786
Yes. General.

182
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:25.997
As you wish.

183
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.247
Understood.

184
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.461
What happened. honey?

185
00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:34.338
Things with work.

186
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.632
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

187
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.594
I'm making the chicken he likes.
but he's out with the girlfriend.

188
00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:45.683
Tell me what's wrong.

189
00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:48.602
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

190
00:12:52.982 --> 00:12:55.026
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

191
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.030
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man.

192
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.782
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

193
00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.909
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

194
00:13:04.827 --> 00:13:05.995
Hm.

195
00:13:06.996 --> 00:13:10.499
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back. well. then...

196
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.501
I didn't hear them complaining. did I?

197
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:15.253
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

198
00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.173
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

199
00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:22.094
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police. you know?

200
00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.470
And most of all. to the top brass.

201
00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:26.431
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

202
00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:27.599
Mm.

203
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.564
Oh. shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

204
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.358
Egrets from the Himalayas.

205
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.945
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

206
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.115
They cost me a million dollars.

207
00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:51.373
Bastards.

208
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.086
Stay in the fucking tree!

209
00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.681
Seems like you lost that dough.
eh. cousin?

210
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.852
That's your problem. Pablo.

211
00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:14.438
You think that everything
can be controlled.

212
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:17.024
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

213
00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:22.947
OK. OK. OK. Gustavo... OK.

214
00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:27.325
Your English is really good.

215
00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.537
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

216
00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:32.247
How long you been at the comuna?

217
00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:34.416
Just a few weeks.

218
00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:37.044
Is your husband
gonna help us here. too?

219
00:14:37.128 --> 00:14:40.464
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

220
00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:45.302
Oh. he's. uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

221
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.518
- I fucked up.
- How?

222
00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:55.146
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

223
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.355
No. Jaramillo's sending a message.

224
00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:02.111
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

225
00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:04.738
He's setting Carrillo up for failure.
and when he does fail.

226
00:15:04.822 --> 00:15:06.157
he'll fire him for incompetence.

227
00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:09.034
and me and you.
we lose the only cop we can trust.

228
00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:12.913
- Hey!
- Hey!

229
00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:14.706
- Sorry I'm late. honey.
- Mm...

230
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.251
Javier. this is my friend. Elisa.

231
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.129
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

232
00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:21.254
Nice to meet you.

233
00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.759
Are you another... janitor at the embassy.
like Steve?

234
00:15:25.843 --> 00:15:27.928
No. actually. I'm CIA.

235
00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:31.431
But that's classified.
so don't tell anybody.

236
00:15:31.515 --> 00:15:35.060
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

237
00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:37.855
- The janitor thing. what. that was you?
- Mm.

238
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.107
No. it's just a cover.

239
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:42.609
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

240
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:45.654
Just so you know.
I'm a communist guerrillera.

241
00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:48.949
Perfect.

242
00:15:49.158 --> 00:15:51.618
If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

243
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.246
we probably wouldn't have cared.

244
00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.623
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

245
00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:59.793
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

246
00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:02.921
He had better resources
and better information.

247
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.465
And at the time.
he owned over 800 homes and fincas.

248
00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:08.552
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

249
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.223
And cops...
he owned a lot of them. too.

250
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.473
But not all of them.

251
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:18.020
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

252
00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.647
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

253
00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:22.983
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

254
00:16:24.193 --> 00:16:26.695
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

255
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.324
Trapped a little bird.

256
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.036
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

257
00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:36.163
Jesus.

258
00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:44.088
Just remember that you wanted all in.

259
00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:46.173
Hand me that coffee.

260
00:16:57.893 --> 00:17:00.437
He already gave up
the name of three fincas.

261
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.773
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

262
00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.902
But you do know
where he is hiding. don't you?

263
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.008
Look. little brother.

264
00:17:30.092 --> 00:17:33.345
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

265
00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:37.266
But I will also kill you.

266
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.434
And very slowly.

267
00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:43.647
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

268
00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:48.360
Well. then. you should pray we find him.
and quickly.

269
00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:54.241
We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out.

270
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:57.869
but there was a small part of me
that thought. in his arrogance.

271
00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.080
he would stand and fight.

272
00:18:00.164 --> 00:18:02.624
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

273
00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.584
Boss!

274
00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:05.669
Poison...

275
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.045
Boss!

276
00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:11.300
They were headed for El Bizcocho.
but they got off the main highway.

277
00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.136
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

278
00:18:14.345 --> 00:18:15.470
Two hours. boss.

279
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:19.016
Round up the guys.
and tell them to get ready.

280
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.018
- We're leaving.
- All right.

281
00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.106
We have to go.

282
00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:28.400
Go where?

283
00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.194
The police are coming.

284
00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:32.529
- But Pablo. I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry. my love.

285
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:36.491
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

286
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.451
We'll buy new ones later.
won't we?

287
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:43.581
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.418
Do you hear me complaining?

289
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:54.467
As long as you're with us. Pablo.
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

290
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.479
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- Yes. sir.

291
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:07.898
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

292
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:11.151
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

293
00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:12.527
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

294
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.072
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

295
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.703
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

296
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.455
Yes. sir!

297
00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.349
What's wrong. Gustavo?

298
00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.810
You fucked us. Pablo.

299
00:19:47.438 --> 00:19:49.440
Not only you and me.

300
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.149
You fucked the whole family.

301
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:58.865
But of course. since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

302
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.620
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country.

303
00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:06.039
the rest of us get screwed.
isn't that right?

304
00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.713
But what the fuck...

305
00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:17.550
a man only dies once. right?

306
00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:21.930
Come here.

307
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.105
My brother.

308
00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:33.733
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on. come on.

309
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.904
There we go.

310
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.042
I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

311
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.586
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time.

312
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:58.049
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

313
00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:02.220
You may have 800 houses. my friend.
but none of them is home.

314
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:05.390
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life.

315
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:08.435
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

316
00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.021
From now on.
nowhere is safe.

317
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.459
The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

318
00:21:32.543 --> 00:21:34.878
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

319
00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:40.175
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

320
00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:44.971
Hey. if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out. too.

321
00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.975
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

322
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.853
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

323
00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.439
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

324
00:21:55.482 --> 00:22:00.612
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit.
I got very lucky.

325
00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:05.409
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

326
00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:08.245
We raided it.
and guess who we found?

327
00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.497
Blackbeard.

328
00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:13.958
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

329
00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:17.546
In custody.
he would describe a cocaine empire

330
00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:21.466
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

331
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.344
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

332
00:22:24.428 --> 00:22:28.765
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice.

333
00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:31.059
home of Colombia's supreme court.

334
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.686
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

335
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.484
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

336
00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:40.944
Fuck.

337
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:44.739
Fuck.

338
00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:46.866
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

339
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.119
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

340
00:22:49.202 --> 00:22:51.538
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

341
00:22:51.622 --> 00:22:53.748
Javi. there's some good stuff in here.
stuff we can use.

342
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:56.000
None of it can leave the room.

343
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.878
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

344
00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:01.798
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

345
00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:04.551
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

346
00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:11.766
Take 'em.

347
00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:15.937
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

348
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.981
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:20.525
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

350
00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:26.364
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

351
00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:28.908
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

352
00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:30.702
They're not gonna
search a white boy. OK?

353
00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:33.037
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

354
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:34.205
Just do it.

355
00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:38.835
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

356
00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.963
- And sometimes. bad people...
- Señor.

357
00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:43.298
...help you do good things.

358
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:46.926
These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

359
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.055
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

360
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.600
Yes.

361
00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:58.730
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

362
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.315
Obviously. it's an alias.

363
00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:04.319
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

364
00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:06.655
Because he's not Colombian.

365
00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:12.243
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

366
00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:14.078
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

367
00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:18.249
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

368
00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:22.879
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

369
00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:28.009
Suarez. do you ever worry
what will happen to you

370
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:31.388
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

371
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:35.099
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

372
00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:38.811
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

373
00:24:40.689 --> 00:24:44.693
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

374
00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:48.655
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

375
00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:57.121
Wha... What the fuck is this?

376
00:24:57.205 --> 00:24:58.831
This is me giving you homework.

377
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.292
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

378
00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:03.127
And I need you to find out who it is.

379
00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:06.089
First off. I don't fucking work for you.
Murphy. you hear me?

380
00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:09.050
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

381
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:13.597
What's he up to these days?

382
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.972
Barry Seal.

383
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:25.358
Barry Seal. a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football.

384
00:25:25.442 --> 00:25:28.111
mind-altering chemicals.
and pussy...

385
00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:30.739
which made him perfect CIA material.

386
00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:35.034
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

387
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.829
Finding Barry was easy.

388
00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:40.998
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

389
00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:43.543
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite. too.

390
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:46.212
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

391
00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:49.633
No. I'm serious.

392
00:25:50.634 --> 00:25:52.009
Look.

393
00:25:52.093 --> 00:25:55.305
Oh. my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

394
00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:56.848
Until next time.

395
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:03.354
- Goddamn. is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

396
00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:06.858
Come on. we got you a ride
waiting over here.

397
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:08.610
Hi. Vanessa.

398
00:26:09.569 --> 00:26:12.322
It's fun to say. though.
ain't it? "McPickle"?

399
00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:18.745
Have a seat. Barry.

400
00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:27.462
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

401
00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:30.256
Well. you guys ain't got shit.

402
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.094
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

403
00:26:35.178 --> 00:26:37.180
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

404
00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:41.976
Yeah? Well. let's see
if that holds up in court. huh?

405
00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:45.772
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

406
00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:47.565
without making a refueling stop.

407
00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:50.985
Yeah. according to the records.
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

408
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.613
The manifests don't lie.

409
00:26:53.697 --> 00:26:57.826
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine.

410
00:26:57.909 --> 00:27:01.579
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department. wouldn't it?

411
00:27:01.663 --> 00:27:05.542
Well. damn...
you guys are good.

412
00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:06.959
Communist sympathizer.

413
00:27:07.043 --> 00:27:09.045
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big. red bow

414
00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:10.922
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

415
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:13.508
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments.

416
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:16.135
that's treason and trafficking.

417
00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:18.596
What's that.
two life sentences for the price of one?

418
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:20.807
That's right.

419
00:27:23.894 --> 00:27:27.939
Well... see.
I figured this day might come.

420
00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:31.067
Why don't you uncuff me. boys.
I got something to show you.

421
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.276
Yeah? What's that?

422
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.071
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

423
00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:38.533
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on. uncuff me.

424
00:27:38.616 --> 00:27:41.118
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

425
00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:45.164
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

426
00:27:45.248 --> 00:27:49.293
'Cause at the time. Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas.

427
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:52.171
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

428
00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:54.966
for cocaine shipments to the US.

429
00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:59.095
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

430
00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:00.513
I couldn't have made that up.

431
00:28:00.597 --> 00:28:02.473
- Holy shit.
- It was too good.

432
00:28:02.557 --> 00:28:05.351
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait. wait. wait. No.

433
00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:08.187
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

434
00:28:08.271 --> 00:28:11.733
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

435
00:28:11.816 --> 00:28:13.985
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

436
00:28:14.068 --> 00:28:17.530
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

437
00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:19.866
- You know. I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

438
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.453
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

439
00:28:32.837 --> 00:28:36.090
I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants.

440
00:28:36.173 --> 00:28:39.260
but frankly.
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

441
00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:41.220
He was just another busted trafficker

442
00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:44.891
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

443
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.603
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

444
00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:51.856
to get the resources we needed.
then fuck him.

445
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.275
Strange bedfellows. indeed.

446
00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:58.112
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

447
00:28:58.321 --> 00:29:00.281
Washington is gonna go crazy.

448
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:02.784
Thank you. Ambassador.

449
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:07.204
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

450
00:29:07.288 --> 00:29:08.414
Of course.

451
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:11.709
Thank you.

452
00:29:14.128 --> 00:29:18.716
In Washington. "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

453
00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:22.804
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

454
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:25.807
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

455
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.311
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

456
00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:33.564
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

457
00:29:33.648 --> 00:29:36.901
This picture shows Federico Vaughan.

458
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:40.822
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua.

459
00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:45.869
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

460
00:29:46.953 --> 00:29:51.165
No. there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

461
00:29:51.374 --> 00:29:54.502
Being a rat is a dangerous business.

462
00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:56.713
and Escobar's reach was long.

463
00:29:56.796 --> 00:29:59.423
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

464
00:30:01.592 --> 00:30:04.637
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

465
00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:06.138
Whoops.

466
00:30:13.104 --> 00:30:15.648
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

467
00:30:15.732 --> 00:30:18.860
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña. if he wanted a long life.

468
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:21.696
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

469
00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:24.532
I didn't kill him. Escobar did.

470
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:27.827
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

471
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:30.080
Look on the bright side. man.

472
00:30:31.956 --> 00:30:34.042
From then on. according to Reagan.

473
00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:37.587
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

474
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.298
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

475
00:30:41.382 --> 00:30:44.343
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

476
00:30:44.552 --> 00:30:48.848
planes. helicopters.
you fucking name it. Everything.

477
00:30:53.728 --> 00:30:58.066
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

478
00:30:58.149 --> 00:31:02.695
and burn 'em straight to the ground.
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

479
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:05.823
We were kicking ass.
and the narcos were feeling it.

480
00:31:06.574 --> 00:31:09.368
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

481
00:31:09.577 --> 00:31:13.748
Despite all this. we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

482
00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:17.543
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether.

483
00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:19.378
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

484
00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:20.504
Got it!

485
00:31:22.006 --> 00:31:24.759
The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia.

486
00:31:24.968 --> 00:31:28.304
Medellín's biggest processing lab.
and we hit it hard.

487
00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:31.724
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

488
00:31:31.808 --> 00:31:34.560
but in the end.
it got us our biggest victory to date.

489
00:31:34.644 --> 00:31:38.940
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

490
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:42.110
In my tent is a bag with $50.000...

491
00:31:42.193 --> 00:31:44.195
ten times this if you give me one hour.

492
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:48.699
There's no way out.
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

493
00:31:52.078 --> 00:31:54.831
Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States.

494
00:31:54.914 --> 00:32:00.377
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

495
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:05.591
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

496
00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:10.721
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

497
00:32:10.805 --> 00:32:14.142
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán.

498
00:32:14.225 --> 00:32:18.479
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

499
00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:20.898
Extradition would become his battle cry.

500
00:32:21.107 --> 00:32:22.900
Gentlemen?

501
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.945
Thank you.

502
00:32:27.197 --> 00:32:31.034
And for the narcos.
this was a declaration of war.

503
00:32:32.202 --> 00:32:35.246
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

504
00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:39.542
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

505
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:43.295
against the legality of extradition.

506
00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:48.300
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

507
00:32:48.384 --> 00:32:50.970
Can we buy someone in that court?

508
00:32:52.055 --> 00:32:54.140
Unfortunately. no.

509
00:32:54.224 --> 00:32:57.685
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

510
00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:01.772
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

511
00:33:01.856 --> 00:33:04.650
Brother... even after he's dead.

512
00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:08.112
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

513
00:33:08.196 --> 00:33:10.114
He's totally fucked.

514
00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:11.824
This is gringo bullshit.

515
00:33:11.908 --> 00:33:15.703
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

516
00:33:15.912 --> 00:33:18.039
We're next. aren't we?

517
00:33:18.248 --> 00:33:20.124
You're right.

518
00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:22.126
Pablito?

519
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.711
Do you have an answer or what?

520
00:33:27.798 --> 00:33:33.345
Well... in my opinion. a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

521
00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:37.600
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

522
00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:40.270
Carlos was one of us.

523
00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:47.151
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

524
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.486
But remember.
there's something they want more than us.

525
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.698
So. brothers...

526
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:55.785
it's time to give them what they want.
isn't it?

527
00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.664
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

528
00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:04.043
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

529
00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:08.505
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

530
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:13.886
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

531
00:34:14.762 --> 00:34:17.681
Two million US dollars.

532
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:20.392
It's very dangerous.

533
00:34:21.602 --> 00:34:25.356
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

534
00:34:26.357 --> 00:34:30.278
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous. right?

535
00:34:41.164 --> 00:34:43.040
But for us. brother...

536
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:47.628
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

537
00:34:48.963 --> 00:34:52.342
We have an historical obligation.

538
00:34:53.843 --> 00:34:56.304
We can't forget that.

539
00:34:56.387 --> 00:34:58.014
I'm his girlfriend.

540
00:35:05.604 --> 00:35:07.190
Meet Pablo Escobar.

541
00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:11.277
Miss.

542
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.030
- OK.
- We have a deal.

543
00:35:14.113 --> 00:35:15.531
All right. then.

544
00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:18.784
We were just leaving.

545
00:35:18.868 --> 00:35:20.203
Good night.

546
00:35:27.543 --> 00:35:29.837
What the hell is this?

547
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.048
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

548
00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:35.843
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

549
00:35:36.927 --> 00:35:38.637
In exchange for what?

550
00:35:38.846 --> 00:35:43.267
Unless you are willing to be part of it.
I cannot say.

551
00:35:45.853 --> 00:35:50.358
It's a partnership.
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

552
00:35:50.441 --> 00:35:54.820
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

553
00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:11.754
Connie?

554
00:36:11.837 --> 00:36:13.672
Elisa? What's going on?

555
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.008
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

556
00:36:16.092 --> 00:36:18.094
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

557
00:36:18.177 --> 00:36:19.387
Yeah.

558
00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:21.222
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

559
00:36:21.305 --> 00:36:22.514
About what?

560
00:36:22.723 --> 00:36:26.685
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

561
00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:28.812
I don't know what it is.
but I know it's gonna be bad.

562
00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:31.899
Wait. Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

563
00:36:32.108 --> 00:36:35.527
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

564
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:37.071
and you need to hide me.

565
00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:39.990
OK. Come on.

566
00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.497
Steve's already at work.
but Javi lives downstairs.

567
00:36:55.172 --> 00:36:56.840
I just hope he's here.

568
00:36:56.924 --> 00:36:58.342
I am.

569
00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:01.887
- Well. what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

570
00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:03.473
I'll be right back. Go.

571
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:10.146
- She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

572
00:37:10.229 --> 00:37:13.190
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

573
00:37:13.274 --> 00:37:15.609
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

574
00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:18.112
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

575
00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:19.363
Escobar and M-19?

576
00:37:19.447 --> 00:37:21.740
She didn't tell me any details.
just that it would be bad.

577
00:37:21.824 --> 00:37:23.742
No... that doesn't make any sense.

578
00:37:23.826 --> 00:37:26.620
She asked me to hide her.
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

579
00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:27.746
OK. All right.

580
00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:42.136
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

581
00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:45.473
Ambassador. I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

582
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:48.184
- ...supreme court building.
- Oh. my God.

583
00:37:49.435 --> 00:37:51.187
"Oh. my God" is right.

584
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.732
Financed by Escobar. the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

585
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:58.319
and occupied the supreme court.

586
00:37:58.528 --> 00:38:01.613
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

587
00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:05.368
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

588
00:38:05.576 --> 00:38:07.119
but it was all bullshit.

589
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.455
The military attacked.

590
00:38:09.663 --> 00:38:11.415
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage.

591
00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:14.960
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

592
00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.588
Most of the M-19 were killed.

593
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:21.842
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

594
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.225
setting fire to the room that contained
600.000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

595
00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:32.978
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

596
00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:40.570
In the United States.
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

597
00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:42.654
so they can't testify in court.

598
00:38:44.073 --> 00:38:48.118
In Colombia. Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

599
00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:54.458
The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

600
00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:57.086
as cannon shells exploded inside.

601
00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:06.429
- Where is she?
- Well. come on in.

602
00:39:06.637 --> 00:39:09.848
You. up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

603
00:39:09.932 --> 00:39:11.225
Put the gun away.

604
00:39:12.184 --> 00:39:13.394
Put it away.

605
00:39:14.604 --> 00:39:16.606
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

606
00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.857
- Can I say something?
- No. you may not.

607
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:22.486
Murphy... calm down.

608
00:39:23.737 --> 00:39:26.198
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

609
00:39:26.282 --> 00:39:28.451
Your wife brought her to me.

610
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.871
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife. I truly do.

611
00:39:32.955 --> 00:39:34.998
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

612
00:39:35.082 --> 00:39:38.001
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

613
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:44.258
If she can tie Escobar to the siege.
I say we bring her in.

614
00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:45.926
Well. she's M-19.

615
00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:48.387
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

616
00:39:48.471 --> 00:39:49.721
and then she gets disappeared.

617
00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:52.057
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

618
00:39:52.141 --> 00:39:54.268
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

619
00:39:54.351 --> 00:39:56.687
Look. all she did was warn us.

620
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.231
She's not on anybody's radar.

621
00:39:59.315 --> 00:40:01.400
She's not involved in anything.

622
00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:09.408
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

623
00:40:09.492 --> 00:40:11.910
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

624
00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:16.039
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

625
00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:18.750
Folks. this is more complicated
than what it seems.

626
00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:22.338
This was Escobar. classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

627
00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:26.175
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

628
00:40:26.383 --> 00:40:29.386
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

629
00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:31.805
He doesn't hold grudges.
not if it suits his purposes.

630
00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:35.809
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

631
00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:38.437
You willing to identify this informant.
Agent Peña?

632
00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:42.232
- No. I am not.
- Needless to say...

633
00:40:42.316 --> 00:40:45.902
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

634
00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:48.113
in light of this communist aggression.

635
00:40:48.197 --> 00:40:50.073
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

636
00:40:50.282 --> 00:40:53.118
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

637
00:41:13.055 --> 00:41:16.433
They're looking for us everywhere.

638
00:41:16.517 --> 00:41:18.477
What did you expect?

639
00:41:18.561 --> 00:41:20.521
That it would be any different?

640
00:41:24.024 --> 00:41:27.069
You did a very good job.

641
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.336
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

642
00:41:44.545 --> 00:41:47.590
No. brother.
The truth is. you helped mine.

643
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.302
You. Ivan...

644
00:41:53.387 --> 00:41:56.640
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

645
00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:01.186
The same one that freed this country.

646
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:08.778
Now it belongs to you.

647
00:42:13.323 --> 00:42:18.704
With it. you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

648
00:42:21.915 --> 00:42:24.876
I promise you.
I will continue the fight.

649
00:42:25.085 --> 00:42:27.045
You earned it. brother.

650
00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:30.340
As for me...

651
00:42:31.675 --> 00:42:33.677
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

652
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.221
We are also...

653
00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:42.728
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

654
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.106
And the fucking sword.
