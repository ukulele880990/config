00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.624
Evening. ladies.

175
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:48.958
What are you so excited about?

176
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.499
Oh. Of course.

177
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.458
Your boyfriend's here.

178
00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:58.749
Hey. girls.

179
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.165
Okay. Okay.

180
00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:03.875
Of course I didn't forget.

181
00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.833
Yes. I brought extra.

182
00:11:07.916 --> 00:11:09.000
Who's hungry?

183
00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:11.916
There we go.

184
00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:17.999
Cal.

185
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.374
Come on. man. Clock's ticking.

186
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.874
Red One. you are
clear for takeoff.

187
00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.332
All right. ladies.

188
00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:55.791
Let's go home.

189
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.207
Thanks for the escort. fellas.

190
00:12:34.208 --> 00:12:35.583
See you next year.

191
00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:39.416
<i>Kavalame!</i>

192
00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:03.416
Come on. Morris.

193
00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:22.707
<i>Go ahead.</i>

194
00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:23.790
I got it.

195
00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:25.624
I don't know what the
hell it is. but I got it.

196
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.165
<i>Send the coordinates.</i>

197
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:31.207
Well. why don't you send
something my way first?

198
00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:35.958
<i>Wiring the first half now. the
rest when the data is verified.</i>

199
00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.332
Pleasure doing
business with you.

200
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:41.874
Yes! Yes!

201
00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:43.124
Yes!

202
00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:44.415
<i>He's staggering.</i>

203
00:13:44.416 --> 00:13:45.708
<i>- He's in the corner!</i>
- No.

204
00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:48.790
- No.
<i>- Morris is down!</i>

205
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:52.082
No! Oh. my God.

206
00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.875
Home sweet home.

207
00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:55.790
Whoa. ladies.

208
00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:15.250
- Red. welcome back.
- Thank you.

209
00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:20.083
Where's the missus?

210
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.165
I'm-I'm right here.

211
00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:25.915
Deliverables was
a half hour ago.

212
00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:28.124
Larry. this is going to Bermuda.

213
00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:30.582
Copy that. Bermuda.

214
00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:32.249
Garcia.

215
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.458
Welcome back. chief.

216
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:36.207
- What'd I miss?
- Nothing.

217
00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:37.999
Everyone's working.

218
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.415
There's a bottleneck in ribbons.

219
00:15:39.416 --> 00:15:40.624
Phil is blaming wrapping.

220
00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:42.415
Wrapping says Phil's
being overdramatic.

221
00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:44.290
Everybody's feeling the heat.

222
00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:45.582
All right. I'll talk to him.

223
00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:48.582
Please. Phil's driving
everybody nuts.

224
00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.332
Phil in ribbons is
having a total meltdown.

225
00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:53.999
Maybe it's time to find a
less stressful spot for Phil.

226
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.290
I don't know. tinsel?

227
00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:56.749
Phil out of ribbons?

228
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.040
Just a thought.

229
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.540
He's got a dog named Ribbons.

230
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:00.708
Yeah. right.

231
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.582
Four ninety-five.
Four ninety-six.

232
00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:05.582
Four ninety-seven.
Four ninety-eight.

233
00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.291
Four ninety-nine. Five hundred.

234
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.165
In five minutes. Not bad.

235
00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:11.749
Yeah. getting warmed up.

236
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.124
All right. I'm
gonna run the simulation model

237
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:16.832
on Belgium and Holland
again just to be safe.

238
00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:19.040
- Thank you. sweetie.
- All right. if you need me. yell.

239
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:21.124
Hey. Callum. Jump in there.

240
00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:22.624
Get him ready. okay?

241
00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:25.208
- It's almost showtime.
- Yes. ma'am. Will do.

242
00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.124
Hey. boss.

243
00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:44.958
Cal.

244
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.708
- Give me a spot. huh?
- Got it.

245
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.875
Up.

246
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.708
Tell me why.

247
00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:14.540
Time for a change. Nick.

248
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.249
- It's like I told you.
- Yeah. I heard you.

249
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.708
And I'll respect your decision.
but I want to know why.

250
00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:22.750
- Let's go heavy.
- Yeah. Got it.

251
00:17:27.416 --> 00:17:29.207
You're looking strong.

252
00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:31.207
We work for the kids. Cal.

253
00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:33.082
We do it for them.

254
00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.415
And I know you love that.

255
00:17:34.416 --> 00:17:36.500
You live for that.

256
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:39.832
So. what's going on here?

257
00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:41.958
I love the kids.

258
00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:45.791
It's the grown-ups
that are killing me.

259
00:17:47.791 --> 00:17:49.000
Go on.

260
00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:52.415
- The list.
- What about the list?

261
00:17:52.416 --> 00:17:54.707
We're up almost
22% year over year.

262
00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:57.249
I'm aware of the numbers. Cal.

263
00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.541
What are you getting at?

264
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.665
For the first time ever. more people
are on the Naughty List than not.

265
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.791
And it's like they
don't even care.

266
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.750
So much bad behavior out
there everywhere you look.

267
00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:14.833
Uh. you say it all
the time. Nick.

268
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.957
We choose every day
who we want to be.

269
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.249
With big decisions
and little ones.

270
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.583
and every one of them matters.

271
00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:30.708
But I look around. and they
act like none of it matters.

272
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:37.416
If nothing matters to them. it seems
to me they need us now more than ever.

273
00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:41.875
That's why there's only one you.

274
00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:47.165
And no one with my doubts
should be so close to you.

275
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:49.249
You need somebody younger.

276
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.040
someone 300 years old. in their
prime. who wants to change things.

277
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:56.082
Not our job to
change people. Cal.

278
00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:57.999
People change themselves.

279
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.499
We just show 'em that
we believe in 'em.

280
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.499
All of 'em.

281
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.915
'Cause we know who they
really are. down deep.

282
00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:11.249
We know that somewhere
inside every lost grown-up

283
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.249
is the kid they once were.

284
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.375
Our gift is that we can see
that. even when they can't.

285
00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:24.249
We work for the kids. Cal.

286
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.000
even when they're
not kids anymore.

287
00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:31.833
I'm just having a really
hard time seeing it.

288
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.041
And that's why.

289
00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:41.208
Let's have a cookie.

290
00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:44.000
The answer to everything.

291
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:46.582
Got to carb up.

292
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.249
You know. I burn about 400...

293
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.415
You burn 430 million
calories every Christmas Eve.

294
00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:52.833
- Yeah.
- Yes. I know.

295
00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:55.708
One last ride. huh?

296
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:58.208
One last ride.

297
00:20:06.416 --> 00:20:07.832
Mmm.

298
00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:37.833
Here!

299
00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.791
Get to it. Lads.

300
00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:52.457
Alpha check. It's Drift.

301
00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.915
Looks like a light just fried
on the anterior west face

302
00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:56.540
up around mail room 19-B.

303
00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:57.707
Anyone up there?

304
00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:59.457
<i>Yeah.
this is Jeff in maintenance.</i>

305
00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:01.165
<i>You don't miss a
thing. Commander.</i>

306
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:03.416
<i>- I'll check it out.</i>
- Thanks. Jeff.

307
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.415
Hey. Jeff. looks like we
got a few more of 'em. too.

308
00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:13.457
What's going on up there?

309
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.250
Jeff?

310
00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:18.916
Jeff. do you copy?

311
00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:21.790
Who's with Red?

312
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:23.374
<i>Arthur.
is he still with you?</i>

313
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.540
Negative. chief.

314
00:22:24.541 --> 00:22:27.500
- <i>Kenny. do you have him?</i>
- Not in the gym.

315
00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:30.915
Who's with Red?

316
00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.540
Gorman. are you
in the residence?

317
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:33.957
<i>Finkle just took over.</i>

318
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:36.040
Finkle. Finkle!

319
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:38.666
I need eyes on Red now!

320
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.624
- Mail room. negative.

321
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.999
Mistletoe hydroponics. negative.

322
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.415
He's not in the gallery.

323

- We have a breach!
- Does anyone have eyes?

330
00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:42.833
Code green! Code
green! Full lockdown!

331
00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:45.707
Armored snowcat heading north.

332
00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:47.415
Copy that.

333
00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:49.415
- Locating.
- Who has eyes?

334
00:23:49.416 --> 00:23:50.915
- Just turned right on Pine.
- Copy.

335
00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:53.166
Containment barrier

Street unit six. deploy.

337
00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:08.333
Box 'em in!

338
00:24:16.375 --> 00:24:17.583
Agents down.

339
00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:30.957
Raise barrier 72!

340
00:24:30.958 --> 00:24:32.708
Raising 72.

341
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.082
Snowcat just turned
left on Candlestick.

342
00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:24.166
There's a hole in the dome.

343
00:26:37.083 --> 00:26:38.707
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

344
00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:40.582
- There's been a breach. Director.
<i>- I know.</i>

345
00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:43.374
Red has been taken.

346
00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:45.707
<i>What? Where's Cal?</i>

347
00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:47.540
- I'm right here.
<i>- Cal. what happened?</i>

348
00:26:47.541 --> 00:26:49.665
<i>- Who could've done this?</i>
- Zoe. I don't know.

349
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:51.082
<i>We are 24 hours
to Christmas Eve.</i>

350
00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:52.750
<i>- We cannot...</i>
- Yes. I'm well aware.

351
00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:57.082
<i>Okay. Okay. let's
take a deep breath.</i>

352
00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.915
<i>Start from the beginning.</i>

353
00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:03.582
They cut a hole in the CF Dome
using an atomic plasma torch.

354
00:27:03.583 --> 00:27:06.957
From the footprints. I'd say there's
eight to ten of them... human.

355
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:09.207
They rolled in on a
remote armored snowcat.

356
00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:11.540
which they used as a diversion
before they blasted out of here

357
00:27:11.541 --> 00:27:13.082
in a NORAD-blind cargo jet.

358
00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:14.374
<i>Good God. Cal.</i>

359
00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:15.957
I'm gonna find 'em. Zoe.

360
00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:17.750
<i>We're gonna work
together on this.</i>

361
00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:20.790
<i>We were just told
that someone hacked</i>

362
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:22.332
<i>the Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.</i>

363
00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:25.165
<i>I don't know if it's related. but
if someone knew where to look.</i>

364
00:27:25.166 --> 00:27:27.165
<i>that's the only vulnerability
in the cloaking.</i>

365
00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:28.790
Who?

366
00:27:28.791 --> 00:27:31.332
<i>We don't know yet. The
trolls are scouring the Web.</i>

367
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:33.207
Name and address.

368
00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:34.457
<i>They're working on it.</i>

369
00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:37.040
Then tell 'em to work faster.
We don't have time for this.

370
00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:39.374
Director. the
trolls have a trace.

371
00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:40.749
<i>Patch them in.</i>

372
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.249
<i>What have you got?</i>

373
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.415
<i>We traced the relays.</i>

374
00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:44.582
<i>Looks like The Wolf.</i>

375
00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:48.082
<i>The Wolf.</i>

376
00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:50.249
Who the hell is The Wolf?

377
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.749
<i>Mercenary. bounty hunter.
works for the highest bidder.</i>

378
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.624
<i>A ghost on the dark web.</i>

379
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:58.791
<i>FBI's been trying to recruit him
for years. but he's a freelancer.</i>

380
00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:02.291
<i>He's probably the best
tracker in the world.</i>

381
00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.458
<i>The guy's a legend.</i>

382
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:19.457
What?

383
00:28:19.458 --> 00:28:21.290
Nice. Are you in town?

384
00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:22.457
<i>That depends.</i>

385
00:28:22.458 --> 00:28:24.290
- What do you want?
<i>- I need you to do me a favor</i>

386
00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:25.624
and go pick up Dylan.

387
00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:27.332
<i>I'm right in the middle
of something important.</i>

388
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.082
This isn't a good time for me.

389
00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:30.374
<i>Yeah. Me. either.</i>

390
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.457
I have two mothers-to-be
with weakening contractions

391
00:28:32.458 --> 00:28:34.665
and labor that's not progressing.
and Craig's out of town.

392
00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:36.165
Liv.

393
00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:37.332
Dylan got in trouble at school.

394
00:28:37.333 --> 00:28:39.707
I just need you to go pick him
up and drop him off at my place.

395
00:28:39.708 --> 00:28:41.082
- Liv.
<i>- Jack.</i>

396
00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:42.582
I'm stuck at work.
and Craig's away.

397
00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.999
so just do me a favor
and go pick up your kid.

398
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:01.332
I got it.

399
00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:02.893
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

400
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:06.041
Hey. buddy.

401
00:29:09.458 --> 00:29:11.582
- Hey. you got any aspirin?
- What?

402
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.541
No.

403
00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.082
<i>I got to get
something in my stomach.</i>

404
00:29:17.083 --> 00:29:18.957
- You want a churro?
- No.

405
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:22.125
Shut up!

406
00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.082
Hey. man. Can I get two?

407
00:29:27.083 --> 00:29:29.916
- I don't want a churro.
- I heard you. They're for me.

408
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.790
So. what are they
saying you did?

409
00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:37.415
Tampered with the school's
attendance records. which I did.

410
00:29:37.416 --> 00:29:39.207
Allegedly.

411
00:29:39.208 --> 00:29:41.082
Never admit that.

412
00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:42.499
Thank you. Have a good day.

413
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.499
Yeah. yeah.

414
00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:50.457
The music teacher leaves his
computer open during fifth period.

415
00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:51.915
Mm-hmm.

416
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:53.915
I started to ditch science so
I could go and practice guitar.

417
00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:55.165
then I'd change it
on the computer.

418
00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:56.665
Makes sense.

419
00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:59.915
There's this girl
in jazz band. Piper.

420
00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:02.624
She started to ditch with
me. but then Kevin...

421
00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:03.915
Who's Kevin?

422
00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:05.957
My best friend. At least he was.

423
00:30:05.958 --> 00:30:07.374
What'd Kevin do?

424
00:30:07.375 --> 00:30:09.124
Kevin found out and
wanted to ditch. too.

425
00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:10.749
But he's not even in jazz band.

426
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.457
He just wanted to
hang out with Piper.

427
00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:14.249
I was the one hanging
out with Piper.

428
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.540
So I'm supposed to go in and
change his absent to present

429
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:19.040
- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

430
00:30:19.041 --> 00:30:21.124
So. instead. I gave
him three more absents.

431
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:23.332
Good. Send a message.

432
00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.790
He got busted and told
the vice principal.

433
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:26.500
Kevin.

434
00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.166
So I slashed the
tires on his bike.

435
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:36.999
- I know. you're disappointed.
- I am disappointed.

436
00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:40.040
Look. if you're gonna hack a
mainframe. you do it quietly.

437
00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:41.582
You go in through a back
door. no fingerprints.

438
00:30:41.583 --> 00:30:44.040
But more importantly.
the second this kid Kevin

439
00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:46.665
knew what you were doing.
you got a loose end.

440
00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:49.832
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

441
00:30:49.833 --> 00:30:53.375
And never let someone get the upper
hand on you. 'cause they'll use it.

442
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:57.791
Yeah.

443
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.124
All right. I got to go practice.

444
00:31:08.125 --> 00:31:11.207
I have this dumb winter pageant
thing tonight for jazz band.

445
00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:13.499
A pageant? Oof.

446
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.165
I know.

447
00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:17.124
I said it was dumb.

448
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.250
Good luck.

449
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.750
- We're gonna talk when I come in.
- I know.

450
00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:28.582
- Thought labor wasn't progressing.
- Yeah. then it did.

451
00:31:28.583 --> 00:31:30.540
Thanks for picking
him up. though.

452
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:33.332
I don't know what's going on with
him these days. He's acting out.

453
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:35.749
Yeah. well. you know.
growing up is tough.

454
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.665
Is that why you're avoiding it?

455
00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:40.040
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

456
00:31:40.041 --> 00:31:41.624
Yeah.

457
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:43.124
He'd really love to see
you more often. Jack.

458
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:44.582
I just picked him up.

459
00:31:44.583 --> 00:31:46.665
- I know.
- It was really nice. We had a good talk.

460
00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:48.665
He told me about school. I
mean. I don't know what...

461
00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:50.624
He would love that to happen
more often. is all I'm saying.

462
00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:51.958
I got to go to work.

463
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.499
Okay.

464
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.000
Merry Christmas. Jack.

465
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.415
Yeah.

466
00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:03.165

Hi. Jack.

475
00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:49.999
We know what you did.

476
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.624
Huh?

477
00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:53.250
We know what you did.

478
00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:00.666
Okay. Um...

479
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.041
First of all. sorry.

480
00:35:06.208 --> 00:35:09.040
Second. could you
be more specific?

481
00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:11.624
Honestly. you could be talking
about 12 different things right now.

482
00:35:11.625 --> 00:35:13.125
Who are you working for?

483
00:35:14.708 --> 00:35:16.832
Lady. I don't know what
you're talking about.

484
00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.582
I work for whoever pays me.

485
00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:19.957
You have about 40 seconds

486
00:35:19.958 --> 00:35:22.332
to become helpful before you
have a terrible accident.

487
00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:24.665
so I'm gonna ask
you one more time:

488
00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:26.915
Who hired you to find him?

489
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.457
- Find who?
- You know who.

490
00:35:28.458 --> 00:35:30.040
I
promise you I don't.

491
00:35:30.041 --> 00:35:31.540
If I did. I would tell you.

492
00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:33.791
I'm not a scrupulous
person. You can ask anybody.

493
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.874
The Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.

494
00:35:37.875 --> 00:35:39.083
Sound familiar?

495
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:43.957
Yeah. I did that.

496
00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:45.165
It was a weird job.

497
00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:47.249
Somebody was trying to find
someone who was running tests

498
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.207
on some weapons systems
in the arctic. and I...

499
00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:52.374
I found the location.
and I walked.

500
00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:53.665
For who?

501
00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:55.040
I don't know.

502
00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:58.207
I'm telling you. all the communication
is encrypted and untraceable.

503
00:35:58.208 --> 00:35:59.957
That's how it's supposed to be

504
00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:02.916
so if someone like you shows
up I don't have any answers.

505
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.457
Look. I don't ask questions.

506
00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:07.749
I just find people that
no one else can find.

507
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.291
It's what I do.

508
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:16.790
You really don't
know what you did.

509
00:36:16.791 --> 00:36:19.165
I guess not.

510
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.458
I mean. I can tell you're
very upset about it. though.

511
00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:27.332
Box him up.

512
00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:28.874
Box me up?

513
00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:30.457
Wait. wait. What
do you mean? Hey.

514
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.750
Is this really necessary?

515
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.791
Ow.

516
00:37:03.041 --> 00:37:04.290
Cool place.

517
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:06.500
How long you been here?

518
00:37:07.666 --> 00:37:08.790
M-O-R-A?

519
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:10.249
MORA.

520
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.749
The Mythological Oversight
and Restoration Authority.

521
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.332
Come again?

522
00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:16.374
We are the multilateral
international organization

523
00:37:16.375 --> 00:37:19.625
responsible for securing and
protecting the mythological world.

524
00:37:21.708 --> 00:37:22.833
Come with me.

525
00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.249
- Did you say "the mythological world"?
- Yes.

526
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.374
Right.

527
00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:33.124
So. uh. bigfoot.

528
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:35.749
Loch Ness Monster.
that kind of thing?

529
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.082
That kind of thing.

530
00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:39.499
Okay. so...

531
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.665
things that don't actually exist.
you guys are responsible for.

532
00:37:42.666 --> 00:37:44.040
Got it.

533
00:37:45.708 --> 00:37:47.166
Holy shit!

534
00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:03.207
If he knows anything.
he ain't talking.

535
00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:05.790
All right. Horse back to the
pen. body back to Area 32.

536
00:38:05.791 --> 00:38:07.915
And get the pumpkin back
in the cryo-vault stat.

537
00:38:07.916 --> 00:38:09.499
Yes. Director.

538
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.124
What the hell was that?

539
00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:12.415
The Horseman.

540
00:38:12.416 --> 00:38:14.958
We're questioning all
the usual suspects.

541
00:38:16.541 --> 00:38:18.875
The Headless Horseman?

542
00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:22.665
Hey. What did that Taser
thing do to my head?

543
00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:24.874
It's not a Taser.
It's an Acquiescer.

544
00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:27.833
Just take a deep breath
and have a seat. Jack.

545
00:38:46.833 --> 00:38:48.458
What am I doing here?

546
00:38:50.916 --> 00:38:54.540
Last night. at roughly
11:00 p.m. NPST.

547
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:58.374
Red One. also known as
Saint Nicholas of Myra.

548
00:38:58.375 --> 00:39:01.291
was abducted from the
North Pole complex.

549
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.957
The data you retrieved from the I-Triple-S
was used to pinpoint the location.

550
00:39:08.958 --> 00:39:12.166
which has been secure and classified
for several hundred years.

551
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.165
Use your words.

552
00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:25.540
Are you saying...

553
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:29.165
Santa Claus has been kidnapped?

554
00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:31.707
And you think I had
something to do with it?

555
00:39:31.708 --> 00:39:32.999
Where is he?

556
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:37.375
Is that him?

557
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:43.041
Jack "The Wolf" O'Malley. meet
Callum Drift. commander of the E.L.F.

558
00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:45.540
The E.L.F.?

559
00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:47.290
Turns out Jack here didn't
know what he was doing.

560
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:50.499
Somebody hired him to find the
complex. and incredibly. he did.

561
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.915
Who?

562
00:39:51.916 --> 00:39:53.624
- He doesn't know.
- I don't know.

563
00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:55.874
- Yes. he does.
- No. he doesn't.

564
00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:57.832
They always know something.

565
00:39:57.833 --> 00:40:00.041
Sometimes you just got
to shake it out of 'em.

566
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.124
I'm not gonna like you.

567
00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:06.125
I can tell right away. out of
everyone here. I like you the least.

568
00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:08.625
Garcia.

569
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:14.957
What the...

570
00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:16.624
Yeah. chief.

571
00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.499
- This guy's not cooperating.
- Ah.

572
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.249
Should we do the thing?

573
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.749
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

574
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.665
- Cal. let's talk about this for a minute.
- There's nothing to talk about.

575
00:40:23.666 --> 00:40:25.415
You can't trust this
guy. He's on the list.

576
00:40:25.416 --> 00:40:27.499
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

577
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.781
Look. I'm not on any watch
list. I know for a fact that...

578
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.665
Wait a minute.

579
00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:33.832
You don't mean...

580
00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:35.957
Yes. that list. You're
on it. I checked.

581
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:37.790
- NL-Four.
- Are you telling me

582
00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:41.040
this clown is a Level
Four Naughty Lister?

583
00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:44.624
- A Level Four Naughty Lister?
- Oh. is that funny to you?

584
00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:46.624
Hey. hey. hey. What are we doing here?

585
00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:48.415
- Come on.
- I know this is killing you.

586
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:49.749
but you have to trust me.

587
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.290
Dismembering this shit
bag isn't gonna help.

588
00:40:51.291 --> 00:40:53.915
It would feel good.
but it won't help.

589
00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:55.124
I'm right here.

590
00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.208
Shut up.

591
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:00.582
- What are you thinking?
- We're gonna put him to work.

592
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:03.165
- No. absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

593
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:05.790
You said you work
for whoever pays you.

594
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:06.874
Today that's me.

595
00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:08.832
He's not telling us everything
he knows. Look at him.

596
00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.124
He is telling us
everything he knows.

597
00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:11.415
He just doesn't
know who hired him.

598
00:41:11.416 --> 00:41:14.957
Well. I mean. how much
are we talking here?

599
00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:17.665
Garcia.

600
00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:18.957
Okay.

601
00:41:18.958 --> 00:41:22.457
Okay. I don't know who it was. but
I can figure out where they are.

602
00:41:22.458 --> 00:41:24.833
Or where they were
last night.

603
00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.833
God.

604
00:41:30.625 --> 00:41:34.207
Look. it is anonymous...
I don't know who it is...

605
00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:38.915
but in my line of work. I need insurance.
you know. in case of billing issues.

606
00:41:38.916 --> 00:41:41.082
so I Trojan-horse a
digital tracking bug

607
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:42.832
- into their VPN.
- Are you saying...

608
00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:43.957
Yeah. I can track the device.

609
00:41:43.958 --> 00:41:45.374
Then I suggest you do it.

610
00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:47.124
Can we circle back on the
whole paying me thing?

611
00:41:47.125 --> 00:41:49.124
I know what they paid
you. We'll double it.

612
00:41:49.125 --> 00:41:51.249
- Triple.
- Garcia.

613
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.915
Hey. hey. hey. hey! Come on!

614
00:41:52.916 --> 00:41:56.249
All right. all right.
Double's fine. It's Christmas.

615
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.415
Wise choice.

616
00:41:57.416 --> 00:41:59.083
I need my cell phone.

617
00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:08.415
Whoever did this...

618
00:42:08.416 --> 00:42:10.249
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

619
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.499
I work alone.

620
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.457
- You used to.
- No offense.

621
00:42:13.458 --> 00:42:16.290
but I'm not rolling into Aruba
undercover with a giant elf.

622
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:18.290
It's E.L.F.!

623
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:20.332
- Cal.
- We can't trust this guy.

624
00:42:20.333 --> 00:42:22.332
That's why you're
holding the leash.

625
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:23.582
And this...

626
00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:27.582
is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

627
00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:29.374
You're mine until we find him.

628
00:42:29.375 --> 00:42:31.166
I suggest you get going.

629
00:42:33.666 --> 00:42:36.416
Claws!

630
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:03.124
Well. this is unfortunate.

631
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:06.582
No. this is what
needed to be done.

632
00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.958
I sincerely doubt that.

633
00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:14.541
You know. I know a guy who's
gonna be very upset about this.

634
00:43:20.583 --> 00:43:22.083
What are you gonna do with that?

635
00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:26.041
The world is a mess
because they fear nothing.

636
00:43:27.916 --> 00:43:30.750
I'm going to give them
something to fear.

637
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.915
I'm going to do in one night

638
00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:38.874
what you have failed
to do for centuries.

639
00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:40.957
And what is that?

640
00:43:40.958 --> 00:43:43.500
I'm gonna make the
world a better place.

641
00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:54.749
What are you doing?

642
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.125
Borrowing some of your energy.

643
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:01.458
Now...

644
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:05.333
go to sleep. Nicholas.

645
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.791
Go to sleep.

646
00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:40.707
We doing some last-minute
Christmas shopping?

647
00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:42.374
Gearing up.

648
00:44:42.375 --> 00:44:43.957
Grab a car. something practical.

649
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:49.249
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la.
la-la-la-la. deck the halls...</i>

650
00:44:57.083 --> 00:44:58.083
Here.

651
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.833
Let's go.

652
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.915
<i>♪ Strike the harp
and join the chorus ♪</i>

653
00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:15.999

654
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.665

655
00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:20.790
<i>♪ Fa-la-la.

656
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:21.957
Ooh!

657
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.749
What the hell just happened?

658
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.083
Toy stores.

659
00:45:45.166 --> 00:45:46.749
Toy stores what?

660
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.707
The supply closets
are portal stations

661
00:45:48.708 --> 00:45:52.207
for the North Pole Field
Network Transit System.

662
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.500
Car.

663
00:46:04.958 --> 00:46:06.082
I said practical.

664
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:07.582
Like what. a minivan?

665
00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:09.124
Who wants a
practical Hot Wheels?

666
00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:10.540
Also. what difference
does it make?

667
00:46:10.541 --> 00:46:12.707
I gave you a directive.

668
00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:14.124
A directive?

669
00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:17.915
Is that what you
think is going on here?

670
00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:20.207
I'm telling you now.
you better listen to me

671
00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:22.249
because things are
about to get real.

672
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.582
- How did...
- I adjusted it to reality.

673
00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:41.415
- And does that...
- No. it doesn't work on everything.

674
00:46:41.416 --> 00:46:43.374
No. you can't try it.
No. you can't drive.

675
00:46:43.375 --> 00:46:45.249
No more questions. Now. get in.

676
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.750
And be careful
with those robots.

677
00:47:05.291 --> 00:47:08.791
So you're like the
bodyguard for Santa Claus.

678
00:47:09.875 --> 00:47:11.499
I'm the commander of the E.L.F.

679
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.957
What's that stand for?

680
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:14.832
Enforcement. Logistics
and Fortification.

681
00:47:14.833 --> 00:47:16.624
But as far as you're
concerned. it stands for

682
00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:19.415
Extremely Large and Formidable.

683
00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:23.000
Mm-hmm.

684
00:47:24.791 --> 00:47:28.666
And that's all you do all
year. just... protect Santa?

685
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.250
- It's a big job.
- Sure. Sure.

686
00:47:35.083 --> 00:47:36.208
It's one day. though. right?

687
00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:39.165
Like. it's a big
job for one day.

688
00:47:39.166 --> 00:47:43.415
We work 364 days a year
because on that one day

689
00:47:43.416 --> 00:47:47.124
we deliver presents to several
billion individual domiciles

690
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:52.290
across 37 time zones without ever
being detected by a single human being.

691
00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:56.624
We prep. we rehearse every moment.
every stop down to the last chimney.

692
00:47:56.625 --> 00:47:58.999
So yeah. it's a lot of work.

693
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.290
Three hundred and
sixty-four days?

694
00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:02.416
We have Boxing Day off.

695
00:48:05.625 --> 00:48:07.582
Wouldn't it be easier
if you broke it up?

696
00:48:07.583 --> 00:48:11.040
You know. like send different teams out
different places. just more efficient?

697
00:48:11.041 --> 00:48:12.457
No. it doesn't work like that.

698
00:48:12.458 --> 00:48:13.874
He's got to do it all himself?

699
00:48:13.875 --> 00:48:16.207
He doesn't have to.
It's his purpose.

700
00:48:16.208 --> 00:48:17.790
He's a singular force
in the universe.

701
00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:21.082
Okay. so worst-case scenario... is
there someone that can step in for him.

702
00:48:21.083 --> 00:48:22.665
like a vice Santa Claus?

703
00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.499
Are you listening to me? No.

704
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.290
No one can do what he does.

705
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.124
He knows when you're sleeping.
he knows when you're awake.

706
00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:32.415
and he knows that about every
single person on this planet.

707
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:36.290
He has a list the size of Rhode
Island. and he checks it twice.

708
00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:38.124
If you were to try to
read that list just once.

709
00:48:38.125 --> 00:48:40.582
it would take you a decade.
but he does it twice.

710
00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:42.915
And the reason why he's
able to do any of it

711
00:48:42.916 --> 00:48:47.790
is because he is Santa
Claus. the one and only.

712
00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:50.750
and no one else can
execute his mission.

713
00:48:51.833 --> 00:48:53.082
Which is?

714
00:48:53.083 --> 00:48:55.582
To spread cheer. asshole.

715
00:48:55.583 --> 00:48:57.500
Good feeling.

716
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:01.750
Ready for a test.

717
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:03.832
Bring me the weapon.

718
00:49:56.666 --> 00:49:58.207
Duplication complete.

719
00:49:58.208 --> 00:50:00.165
Good.

720
00:50:00.166 --> 00:50:02.499
Now let's see if it works.

721
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.749
Who do you have in mind. Mum?

722
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.874
We'll start with the
first name on the list.

723
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.208
All right.
now we're talking.

724
00:50:32.916 --> 00:50:35.415
Well. it was nice
to meet you. Cal.

725
00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:36.957
Good luck with everything.

726
00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:38.249
Thank you so much.

727
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.957
I'm just gonna live here now.

728
00:50:39.958 --> 00:50:41.957
- Gonna marry her.
- Why don't you focus?

729
00:50:41.958 --> 00:50:44.124
We got to find your guy.

730
00:50:44.125 --> 00:50:46.625
Not a lot of fun. are you. Cal?

731
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.874
Oh. I'm fun.

732
00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:52.915
As a matter of fact. I won the
prize for most fun gift wrapper

733
00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:55.791
for 183 years in a row.

734
00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.500
Well. I take it back.

735
00:51:03.375 --> 00:51:04.915
Want me to show
you how to do this?

736
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.540
I would suggest
you give it a shot.

737
00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:09.332
I see the worst
in everyone. Cal.

738
00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:10.915
It's my gift.

739
00:51:10.916 --> 00:51:12.415
And it's the key to my work.

740
00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:15.583
I can see a person's worst
qualities just by looking at 'em.

741
00:51:16.916 --> 00:51:18.582
See. look at this guy.

742
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:20.332
He's married but not to her.

743
00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:22.665
That's why he has a tan line
where his wedding ring should be.

744
00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:25.665
This guy's about to screw over that guy.

745
00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:27.749
That's why he's
laughing too loud.

746
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:31.457
And this guy... now.
he's interesting.

747
00:51:31.458 --> 00:51:32.832
Why. you ask?

748
00:51:32.833 --> 00:51:34.832
- I didn't ask.
- Well. I'll tell you.

749
00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:36.874
Shoes.

750
00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:37.999
Look around.

751
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.832
Anyone else at the beach wearing
shoes besides you. me and him?

752
00:51:41.833 --> 00:51:43.583
And we're all working something.

753
00:51:50.916 --> 00:51:52.749
Ah.

754
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.332
He's a Karmanian Death Merc.

755
00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:57.374
So is that guy and that guy.

756
00:51:57.375 --> 00:52:00.082
You can tell by the
tattoos on their hands.

757
00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:02.624
This is all fascinating. How about we
find the guy we're actually looking for?

758
00:52:02.625 --> 00:52:05.458
That's the guy
we're looking for.

759
00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:08.707
The Karmanians are
his security detail.

760
00:52:08.708 --> 00:52:10.540
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

761
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:12.665
We'll have a few drinks.
paint some nails.

762
00:52:12.666 --> 00:52:13.957
We'll see where the
afternoon takes us.

763
00:52:13.958 --> 00:52:15.207
Hey. wait. Whoa. whoa. whoa.

764
00:52:15.208 --> 00:52:16.999
- What are you doing?
- Going to talk to him.

765
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.790
No. No. We got to
go in sideways here.

766
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:21.540
Remember when I said
they're called Death Mercs?

767
00:52:21.541 --> 00:52:23.332
We'll be fine.

768
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:34.374
Keep walking.

769
00:52:34.375 --> 00:52:36.249
I need to talk to him now.

770
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.832
Keep walking.

771
00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:39.415
I'm gonna count to five.

772
00:52:39.416 --> 00:52:41.832
Then what?

773
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:43.666
- Then you're gonna get hurt.
- Oh.

774
00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:50.874
Listen. dickhead.
It's Christmas.

775
00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:53.708
So in the yuletide spirit. I'm
gonna say it one more time.

776
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:20.791
That was... so disturbing.

777
00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:24.374
- What's this?
- What the hell. Ted?

778
00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:25.832
Just give me a
minute. sweetheart.

779
00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:29.124
I got to talk to these
absolute morons for a second.

780
00:53:29.125 --> 00:53:31.124
and then we'll go get some boba.

781
00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.999
Okay.

782
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.665
- Where is he?
- Who?

783
00:53:34.666 --> 00:53:36.665
- You know who.
- You really want to do this?

784
00:53:36.666 --> 00:53:38.999
Uh. I have no idea what
you're talking about.

785
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.540
And while I'm enjoying this visit from.
uh. the <i>Magic Mike</i> Christmas brigade.

786
00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:46.249
I got a couple ladies
waiting on boba teas.

787
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.124
- Okay. Hey. hey. Wait. wait. wait.
- I'm playing. big boy. Come on.

788
00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:52.582
Before you implode this man's
skull across this heavenly beach.

789
00:53:52.583 --> 00:53:55.374
- can I have a crack at it?
- Look. I'm telling you.

790
00:53:55.375 --> 00:53:59.915
for your own health and well-being.
I suggest you leave right now.

791
00:53:59.916 --> 00:54:01.915
You don't know who I know.

792
00:54:01.916 --> 00:54:04.540
All right. Well. you
know what I know?

793
00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.540
I know you bought some
information yesterday

794
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:09.082
and you paid quite a bit for it.

795
00:54:09.083 --> 00:54:11.125
Coordinates. the arctic.

796
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.250
I know this 'cause I'm the
one who sold 'em to you.

797
00:54:16.708 --> 00:54:18.041
You...

798
00:54:20.666 --> 00:54:21.958
You're The Wolf?

799
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:25.499
No. You should not be here.

800
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.915
Do you know what you've
done by coming here?

801
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:29.790
My client is not
to be messed with.

802
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:31.790
Who's the client? New York?

803
00:54:31.791 --> 00:54:33.624
Much worse.

804
00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:35.790
She'll kill us.
She'll kill us all.

805
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:39.499
- Who is it?
- I can't say her name.

806
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.500
She will hear.

807
00:54:45.791 --> 00:54:49.540
Write her name in the sand.

808
00:54:57.125 --> 00:54:58.790
- "Gree-la"?
- You idiot.

809
00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:00.415
- "Gry-la"?
- No!

810
00:55:00.416 --> 00:55:02.500
<i>"Gree-la"?</i>

811
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:29.416
Cal. Cal.

812
00:55:45.958 --> 00:55:47.832
Callum Drift.

813
00:55:47.833 --> 00:55:53.583
storied warrior
of the North Pole.

814
00:55:54.791 --> 00:55:57.916
Gryla. the Christmas Witch.

815
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.832
It has been many years.

816
00:56:00.833 --> 00:56:02.957
Not enough.

817
00:56:02.958 --> 00:56:04.332
Where is he?

818
00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:08.041
He's right here. fast asleep.

819
00:56:10.041 --> 00:56:11.500
Signal from Commander Drift.

820
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.165
<i>Gryla. where are you?</i>

821
00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:17.082
The Witch.

822
00:56:17.083 --> 00:56:20.457
I need him back
unharmed immediately.

823
00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:23.415
It is not to be. warrior!

824
00:56:23.416 --> 00:56:25.040
I need M-WAT teams in motion

825
00:56:25.041 --> 00:56:27.707
- to every one of her ancestral haunts.
- Yes. Director.

826
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:29.249
What is it you want?

827
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:34.165
The same thing I have always
wanted for hundreds of years.

828
00:56:34.166 --> 00:56:37.040
To make them behave.

829
00:56:37.041 --> 00:56:39.207
The time has come...

830
00:56:39.208 --> 00:56:42.457
to punish the naughty.

831
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:44.124
All of them.

832
00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:46.915
Everyone who is on the list.

833
00:56:46.916 --> 00:56:49.540
Everyone who has ever been

834
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:50.999
<i>on the list.</i>

835
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.290
From killers to jaywalkers.

836
00:56:54.291 --> 00:56:57.415
Anyone who's ever
lied or littered.

837
00:56:57.416 --> 00:57:00.665
Anyone who's ever
been rude or late.

838
00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:04.082
You're talking about
almost everyone.

839
00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:06.707
Everyone I see fit.

840
00:57:06.708 --> 00:57:09.582
Tomorrow they will
all be punished.

841
00:57:09.583 --> 00:57:14.707
And he is going to help.

842
00:57:14.708 --> 00:57:16.790
You know he doesn't
punish people.

843
00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:19.832
Step away. warrior.

844
00:57:19.833 --> 00:57:21.415
Let him go. Witch.

845
00:57:21.416 --> 00:57:22.791
I've warned you.

846
00:57:23.875 --> 00:57:25.249
And I've warned you.

847
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.415
You can't see it yet.

848
00:57:27.416 --> 00:57:31.165
but when you wake up
this Christmas morning.

849
00:57:31.166 --> 00:57:35.291
the world will be much. much...

850
00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:38.125
nicer.

851
00:57:42.916 --> 00:57:44.790
What in the actual fu...

852
00:57:46.375 --> 00:57:48.040
Get those teams moving now.

853
00:57:49.625 --> 00:57:51.707
What the hell was that?

854
00:57:51.708 --> 00:57:53.874
What was that? What
the hell was that?

855
00:57:53.875 --> 00:57:55.540
- Where is she?
- We got to get out of here.

856
00:57:55.541 --> 00:57:56.624
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

857
00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:58.457
I'm just a middleman.
I brokered the deal.

858
00:57:58.458 --> 00:58:01.666
- I'm telling you. she does not mess around.
- Cal. Cal.

859
00:58:54.708 --> 00:58:56.125
Snowmen.

860
00:59:09.916 --> 00:59:10.957
No.

861
00:59:10.958 --> 00:59:13.332
Get him out of here. He's our
only lead. Don't let him get iced.

862
00:59:13.333 --> 00:59:14.707
All right.

863
00:59:18.166 --> 00:59:19.416
Come on.

864
00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:26.041
Go. Go.

865
01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:08.916
Just got to rip
off their carrots.

866
01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:12.458
I'll remember that
next time it comes up.

867
01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:15.499
Want to give me a hand here?

868
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.915
You'll figure it out.

869
01:02:20.666 --> 01:02:26.374
<i>♪ Let me tell you about
Christmas magic...</i>

870
01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.665
I'm sorry. I think you're confusing
me with someone who cares!

871
01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.957
Tell Grandma I don't have
time to pick up her meds.

872
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.165
She can take the bus.

873
01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.082
Goodbye.

874
01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.291
Asshole.

875
01:02:37.458 --> 01:02:39.040
Get a life.

876
01:02:39.041 --> 01:02:43.957
<i>♪ For you to put on your coat ♪</i>

877
01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:49.832

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.332

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.790

- Whoa.

880
01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:57.124
What the...

881
01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:59.374
<i>♪ With the angels singing...</i>

882
01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.165
It's still here.

883
01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:15.707
What do you mean
it's still there?

884
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.124
It's supposed to
come back to me.

885
01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.875
The machine isn't
working. Fix it.

886
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:25.041
Now. or else the next test
will be on one of you.

887
01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:28.082
Yes. Mum.

888
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.500
Careful.

889
01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.958
That's it.

890
01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.749
She iced the broker.

891
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.415
She really wanted
to shut him up.

892
01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:44.165
By the time he thaws out.
he'll be useless to us.

893
01:03:44.166 --> 01:03:46.124
Hey. wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

894
01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:48.957
My guys scanned all the surveillance
footage from the Pole last night.

895
01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.916
Look at this.

896
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.332
- That her?
- Sort of.

897
01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.165
She's a shape-shifter.

898
01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:00.582
She's actually a 900-year-old ogre
with 13 sons who kill on command.

899
01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:02.207
Huh.

900
01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:05.207
Tracking
shape-shifters is a nightmare.

901
01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.249
She said that she was gonna
punish them all. every level.

902
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.290
I'd be more worried about
what she didn't say.

903
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:12.290
She wasn't negotiating.

904
01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:13.957
It's a kidnapping
with no demands.

905
01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:15.207
Doesn't usually end well.

906
01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:18.749
Unfortunately. our only
lead is now an ice cube.

907
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.500
Not pointing any fingers.

908
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:23.249
- Cal. not helpful.
- Yeah. Cal.

909
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.708
Not helpful.

910
01:04:26.416 --> 01:04:28.165
So. what would you normally do?

911
01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:32.582
I mean. normally. I'd
be running credit cards.

912
01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.332
checking pings off
cell phone towers.

913
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:36.957
trying to build a footprint...
her. her associates.

914
01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:39.332
Never tracked a witch before.

915
01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:40.749
Dated a few.

916
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:41.957
Right. Cal?

917
01:04:41.958 --> 01:04:44.291
I've dated several
witches. What's your point?

918
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.124
Would she have any footprint
that I wouldn't know about

919
01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.999
because I'm. like. a
regular human being?

920
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.250
Have you run a check
on recent UDMs?

921
01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:56.624
- What's that?
- Unauthorized deployments of magic.

922
01:04:58.541 --> 01:05:00.832
Lot of hits.
Pretty typical stuff.

923
01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:03.832
Couple of abjurations
in Nairobi.

924
01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.332
Handful of divinations in
Santiago and New Orleans.

925
01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:07.707
No. she's a conjurer.

926
01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:12.165
Got a pair of conjurations
eight days ago. few hours apart.

927
01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:15.165
Picked up the echo off
the resonator in Germany.

928
01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:16.250
The brother.

929
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.082
- Whose brother?
- Nick's.

930
01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:21.333
- Santa's got a brother?
- Adopted. yes.

931
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.540
She's working with the brother.

932
01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:24.874
We don't know that.

933
01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:26.665
No. but can you think of a
better place to hold Nick?

934
01:05:26.666 --> 01:05:28.999
Think about it. It's
under a concealment dome.

935
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.915
and MORA has no jurisdiction
because of the treaty.

936
01:05:30.916 --> 01:05:33.374
He doesn't leave. and we
don't visit. That's the deal.

937
01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:35.457
We bust in and
Nick's not there...

938
01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:36.707
MORA's not going. We're going.

939
01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:38.082
And he's never gonna
know we're there.

940
01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.374
- Cal...
- T minus 17 hours. Director.

941
01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:47.874
Keep me in the loop every step.

942
01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:50.457
In two hours. I brief the
presidents and prime ministers

943
01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:53.374
and kings and queens of
everywhere so they can prepare.

944
01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:55.166
Prepare for what?

945
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.125
For the possibility
of no Christmas.

946
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:08.332
Hey. You don't have a Wonder
Woman action figure. do you?

947
01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.207
That's not how it
works. Come on.

948
01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:12.166
Ah. damn it.

949
01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.040
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

950
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:35.250
I can't
believe they're out of essential oils!

951
01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:42.790
Hey.

952
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.624
Dylan asked you to go to his
concert tonight and you said no?

953
01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.999
What? No. that's
not what happened.

954
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.665
He actually said I shouldn't go.
He said it was gonna be lame.

955
01:06:50.666 --> 01:06:52.415
If he didn't want you to go.

956
01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:53.665
<i>he wouldn't have brought it up.</i>

957
01:06:53.666 --> 01:06:55.874
<i>An actual parent doesn't
need an invitation.</i>

958
01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.290
They just go. whether
the kid likes it or not.

959
01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:01.249
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

960
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.540
Well. we both know that's
not my strong suit. Olivia.

961
01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:06.207
Look. if he wanted me to go.
he should've just asked me.

962
01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.707
He's vulnerable. Jack.

963
01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:10.540
He's a kid. and he
knows you never show up.

964
01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.165
Olivia. I'm in... I'm at work.

965
01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.707
What am I supposed to do?

966
01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:16.457
I don't want to have to
tell you what to do. Jack.

967
01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:19.124
I want you to figure it out on
your own. because it's pretty easy.

968
01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:20.707
The concert starts at 7:00.

969
01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.582
Well. I'm not gonna be home by
7:00. Just tell Dylan that I...

970
01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:23.832
<i>I'm not telling him anything.</i>

971
01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:26.082
If you want to tell him
something. do it yourself.

972
01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:31.249
What?

973
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.541
I didn't say anything.

974
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.791
Dylan. right?

975
01:07:58.458 --> 01:07:59.875
Yeah.

976
01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.499
He's a good kid.

977
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.875
Yeah. I know he's a good kid.

978
01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:17.207
It's not what you think. His
mother and I were never together.

979
01:08:17.208 --> 01:08:19.541
I mean. I'm his father. but
I've never been his dad.

980
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.374
She's a doctor now. and she's
married to a really good guy.

981
01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:28.415
and he is a good dad. so the last
thing the kid needs is. like.

982
01:08:28.416 --> 01:08:31.290
you know. some spare dad
who's a degenerate gambler

983
01:08:31.291 --> 01:08:34.416
hanging out with the scum of the earth.
who's got nothing to offer him. so...

984
01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.832
Honestly. the best thing I can do
for the kid is keep some distance

985
01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:42.124
so I don't get in the way and he's
not disappointed all the time.

986
01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:43.583
Uh-huh.

987
01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.290
"Uh-huh." what?

988
01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:50.166
I'm just saying. if you're
trying not to disappoint him...

989
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
doesn't sound like it's working.

990
01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:23.624
<i>Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this. but...</i>

991
01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.375
what's the deal with
Santa and his brother?

992
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.332
They used to work together...

993
01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:35.874
back in the beginning.

994
01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:38.915
Red gave gifts to
well-behaved children.

995
01:09:38.916 --> 01:09:41.499
and the brother helped keep
track of who they were.

996
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.582
Then the brother
started making lists.

997
01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:47.290
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

998
01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:50.833
He didn't like the idea of a
running list of misbehaved children.

999
01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:54.291
But the brother became obsessed.

1000
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.707
So you're saying Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1001
01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:01.832
Yes.

1002
01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.374
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1003
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:07.749
Red was furious.

1004
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.624
So he took the list away. and
the brother never forgave him.

1005
01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.624
He went out on his own. eventually
hooking up with the Witch.

1006
01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:18.540
who was also in the
punishment game.

1007
01:10:18.541 --> 01:10:22.041
working Iceland and several
other Nordic territories.

1008
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:26.791
They were together for
years. but it ended badly.

1009
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:31.958
Santa's brother have a name. or
is it just "Santa's brother"?

1010
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.499
His name is Krampus.

1011
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:44.082
All right. listen to me. I don't
know what's waiting for us in here.

1012
01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:45.499
but the brother. the Witch.

1013
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.207
they're extremely dangerous. and
not in the ways that you're used to.

1014
01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:50.040
If you see them. do not engage.

1015
01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:51.790
So don't pick a
fight with the Witch.

1016
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:52.874
Got it.

1017
01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:55.415
If Nick is here. he's probably
being held in the dungeon.

1018
01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:57.249
There's a door around
back that the guards use.

1019
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.040
We're gonna have to quietly
sneak through the courtyard.

1020
01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:00.957
past the guillotines.
break in and head down.

1021
01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:02.040
The guillotines?

1022
01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:05.082
Also. do not touch anything
under any circumstances.

1023
01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.749
There is much in here that
is not of the natural world.

1024
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.707
You're human. therefore weak.

1025
01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:12.541
So. if you need to touch
anything. get me to do it.

1026
01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:16.999
Wait a minute.
Are you not human?

1027
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.874
Do I look human?

1028
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.582
Hey. So listen. man.

1029
01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:07.082
I think. if you don't need me here.
I might just go back to the car.

1030
01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.458
Shh.

1031
01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:16.583
- Hellhounds.
- Hellhounds?

1032
01:12:24.666 --> 01:12:25.666
Stand back.

1033
01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:33.832
Ellen.
distract them.

1034
01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:14.415
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1035
01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:15.874
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1036
01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:18.124
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1037
01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:20.124
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha...

1038
01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.249
What'd you do?

1039
01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:22.624
What do you mean what did I do?

1040
01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:23.999
I didn't do anything.

1041
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.832
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1042
01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:29.458
Thieves!

1043
01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.000
Holy shit.

1044
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.040
Whoa. whoa.

1045
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:36.290
Cal! Cal!

1046
01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:38.290
My name is Callum Drift.
commander of the E.L.F.

1047
01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:39.915
- We are not thieves.
- Yeah. we're not thieves!

1048
01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.915
We're not thieves!

1049
01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:44.083
Oh!

1050
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.165
This was in his pocket.

1051
01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:48.499
All right. I can explain that.

1052
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.124
I can explain that.

1053
01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.957
I told you not to
touch anything.

1054
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:00.582
It was an innocent mistake.

1055
01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:04.082
You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1056
01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:06.707
Not innocent and not a mistake.

1057
01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:09.582
Well. who leaves their gold just
lying out in an open treasure chest?

1058
01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:12.040
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1059
01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:14.208
Guests come. they leave him
gifts. You stole from it.

1060
01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.791
I shouldn't be surprised.

1061
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.499
Is that 'cause I happen
to be on the list?

1062
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.749
You disappointed
in me. too. Cal?

1063
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:27.875
I have no expectations of you.
Jack. so I can't be disappointed.

1064
01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:36.707
You know. I got
problems of my own.

1065
01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:39.624
I owe somebody a lot of
money that I don't have.

1066
01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:42.749
I see this giant pile
of gold sitting there.

1067
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:45.457
If you look at it a certain way.
what choice did I even have?

1068
01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:48.582
You have every choice.
It's all choices.

1069
01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:50.707
You don't just happen
to be on the list. Jack.

1070
01:14:50.708 --> 01:14:53.332
You put yourself there.

1071
01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:55.374
You decide to steal gold.

1072
01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:59.540
You decide to only look out for yourself
over everyone else on this Earth.

1073
01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:02.791
Every one of those kids
who are counting on us.

1074
01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:07.416
Counting on me to do my job.

1075
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:19.083
Nick always says that every decision.
big or small. is an opportunity.

1076
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.499
To be nice?

1077
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.707
To be good.

1078
01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:26.125
Or not.

1079
01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.082
I was one day away
from retirement.

1080
01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:33.833
Then this happens.

1081
01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:37.666
After 542 years.

1082
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.290
I resigned yesterday.

1083
01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.791
You did?

1084
01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.000
Why?

1085
01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:50.500
I couldn't see it anymore.

1086
01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:52.833
Couldn't see what?

1087
01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:58.708
Doesn't matter.

1088
01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:14.125
The third touch.

1089
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:21.875
Is that him?

1090
01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:32.874
What are they doing?

1091
01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:39.166
They're playing Krampusschlap.

1092
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.749
Krampusschlap?

1093
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.916
It's the official
game of Krampusnacht.

1094
01:16:57.375 --> 01:17:02.790
Ever undefeated.
Dread Lord Krampus!

1095
01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:14.499
Callum Drift.

1096
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.000
Lord Krampus.

1097
01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:20.165
The festivities
are just beginning.

1098
01:17:20.166 --> 01:17:22.916
but I don't remember
inviting you.

1099
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.165
You shouldn't be here.

1100
01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:33.665
You know you shouldn't be here.

1101
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:36.374
and yet here you are.

1102
01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:38.166
And with a mortal.

1103
01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:41.290
Uh. I'm Jack O'Malley.

1104
01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:42.832
I didn't... I'm not...

1105
01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:45.332
We didn't even... I
mean. obviously we...

1106
01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.040
I just met him today.

1107
01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.166
The big one was armed with this.

1108
01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.124
A Northern Vambrace.

1109
01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:53.582
Thank you.

1110
01:17:53.583 --> 01:17:57.124
Just what I wanted
for Christmas.

1111
01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.332
Krampus. I can explain...

1112
01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.749
You're trying to find him.

1113
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:04.333
and you thought
he would be here.

1114
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.583
Well. guess what. Northerner.

1115
01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.707
He's not here.

1116
01:18:14.833 --> 01:18:17.875
Last night. he was taken from
the compound by the Witch.

1117
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:21.208
And I know that she
was here not long ago.

1118
01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:25.665
Are you accusing me
of something. Drift?

1119
01:18:25.666 --> 01:18:28.707
You and she were partners once.

1120
01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:31.665
Roaming the countryside.
the villages.

1121
01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:33.165
Punishing people.

1122
01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:34.916
Yes.

1123
01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.665
But back then. she was glorious.

1124
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.165
An ogre 18 feet high.

1125
01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:43.332
The skin of an elephant.

1126
01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.625
Giant pair of tails.

1127
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:52.040
And yes. punishing as
the cruelest winter.

1128
01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:55.958
We had some wonderful
times together.

1129
01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.707
But I gave up that
work. remember?

1130
01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:04.999
I spent 700 years
menacing the naughty.

1131
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.040
trying to scare
them into decency.

1132
01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:10.000
I did my part!

1133
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.583
The only punishing I do now...

1134
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:18.332
is for fun.

1135
01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.249
Like my good friend over here...

1136
01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:24.499
enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

1137
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.290
But today is not Krampusnacht.

1138
01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:29.332
In this house. Northerner.

1139
01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:33.624
it is always Krampusnacht!

1140
01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.582
Ooh. ooh.
ah. ah! Ooh. ah. ooh. ah!

1141
01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:38.207
Ah. ah. ah! Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!

1142
01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:40.082
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1143
01:19:40.083 --> 01:19:43.499
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah! Ooh.
ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1144
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.832
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah!

1145
01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:48.165
- Krampus!
- Ah. ah. ah! Ooh...

1146
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:50.500
Why was she here?

1147
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.874
Many years ago.
she gave me a gift.

1148
01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.165
She came because
she wanted it back.

1149
01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:01.540
A gift? What gift?

1150
01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:03.790
The Glaskäfig.

1151
01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:07.457
On its face. a simple
glass snow globe.

1152
01:20:07.458 --> 01:20:11.165
but its true purpose
is nefarious.

1153
01:20:11.166 --> 01:20:12.999
Tremendously punishing.

1154
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.040
She wants to punish them all.

1155
01:20:16.041 --> 01:20:19.749
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

1156
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.125
A prison for but one.

1157
01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.791
Krampus. I need to find him.

1158
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.750
Let me go.

1159
01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:36.082
And why...

1160
01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.166
would I do that?

1161
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.833
Because we need him.

1162
01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.541
Now more than ever. we need him.

1163
01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.041
And you know that.

1164
01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:53.166
Let me go.

1165
01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.124
Northerner.

1166
01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:07.500
You are not going anywhere.

1167
01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.540
You. get out.

1168
01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:14.207
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1169
01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:17.582
There is a price
for this intrusion.

1170
01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:20.874
Now and forever.

1171
01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:23.208
Drift belongs to me.

1172
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:28.707
So I can...

1173
01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:30.500
just walk out of here?

1174
01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:32.833
I suggest you run.

1175
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.958
You'll learn to love it here.

1176
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.707
Take him away.

1177
01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:47.415
Wait. Uh. wait. wait. wait.
wait. Uh. sorry. Wait.

1178
01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:49.040
Um. uh. L-Lord... uh. Mister...

1179
01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:51.957
Lord Krampus. um...

1180
01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:53.541
you and I aren't so different.

1181
01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:00.999
We're pretty different. but I think
we have some things in common.

1182
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.415
Ah. Do you. now?

1183
01:22:03.416 --> 01:22:04.707
Yeah.

1184
01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:07.582
I mean. you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1185
01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.874
Bit of a gambler?

1186
01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:10.374
Well. so am I.

1187
01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:14.832
Now. when we came in here. my man told
me that he thought he could beat you

1188
01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:17.832
at your game. uh. Krampusschlap.

1189
01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.832
What?

1190
01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.999
Now. initially.
I said. "No way."

1191
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.832
But the more I see him getting riled
up. I'm starting to like my odds.

1192
01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.540
so just hear me out.

1193
01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:31.624
If you win. we go to
your dungeon forever.

1194
01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:34.708
If he wins. we walk.

1195
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.749
Unless you don't want
to for some reason.

1196
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.582
I mean. I get that.
He's a big guy.

1197
01:22:39.583 --> 01:22:41.249
No shame.

1198
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.625
Lot of people watching.

1199
01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:50.582
Imbeciles.

1200
01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:52.749
I love it.

1201
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:54.457
- Oh.
- Ooh. ooh. ah. ah!

1202
01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:56.499
Ooh. ah. ooh. ah! Ah. ah. ah!

1203
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1204
01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:20.290
The rules are as follows:

1205
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:23.707
The contestants will
exchange blows in turn.

1206
01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:27.500
The first to be knocked
out or die loses.

1207
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.540
First touch.

1208
01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:36.249
That's you.

1209
01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.499
You know. I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

1210
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.540
Come on.

1211
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:54.416
I'm sure you do.

1212
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.915
He's still your brother.

1213
01:23:57.916 --> 01:23:59.625
And he never gave up on you.

1214
01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.040
What would you know about it?

1215
01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:03.958
I know him.

1216
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:09.625
Take your best "schlap."

1217
01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:27.000
Interesting.

1218
01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.499
My turn.

1219
01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.582
I could be merciful

1220
01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:41.290
and kill him on the first touch.

1221
01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:44.499
But what fun would that
be. huh?

1222
01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.249
Oh. my God.

1223
01:25:11.916 --> 01:25:13.749
Hey. buddy. You okay?

1224
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.749
He just slapped
the shit out of me.

1225
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:17.124
Yeah. that was so embarrassing.

1226
01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:20.165
I love this game!

1227
01:25:20.166 --> 01:25:22.290
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I...

1228
01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:23.874
Just get up. Trust me.

1229
01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:25.875
I can't...

1230
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.250
Second touch.

1231
01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:38.124
Oh. Sorry.

1232
01:25:42.166 --> 01:25:44.541
Let me make it easier for you.

1233
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.832
Come on.

1234
01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.708
Come on.

1235
01:25:58.583 --> 01:25:59.874
Come on.

1236
01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.500
Cover us.

1237
01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:07.458
Ellen. come on!

1238
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.499
I thought I had
some shady friends.

1239
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:32.457
I can't believe that worked.

1240
01:27:32.458 --> 01:27:34.832
Yeah. sorry about that. It's
all I could come up with.

1241
01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:36.415
No. it was great.

1242
01:27:36.416 --> 01:27:38.125
Oh.

1243
01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:40.832
I misjudged you.

1244
01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:45.749
Not what you'd expect from a
Class Four Naughty Lister. right?

1245
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.040
Well. it's Level Four.

1246
01:27:47.041 --> 01:27:48.749
- Ah.
- But that's what I'm saying.

1247
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.208
You could've left.
but you didn't.

1248
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.166
Thank you.

1249
01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:57.790
All right.

1250
01:27:57.791 --> 01:27:59.666
Should we go find your guy?

1251
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:02.833
Let's save Christmas.

1252
01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:06.207
Right.

1253
01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:07.249
Say it.

1254
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.207
- I can't.
- Yes. you can. Say it.

1255
01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:10.624
- I don't want to.
- Let's save Christmas.

1256
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:11.874
I'm not gonna say that.

1257
01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:15.707
I'm gonna need you to say.
"Let's save Christmas."

1258
01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:18.124
All right. God. Okay.

1259
01:28:18.125 --> 01:28:19.915
Let's save Christmas.

1260
01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:21.874
That was terrible.

1261
01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:23.124
Okay.

1262
01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.457
All right. all right.

1263
01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:29.457
Let's save Christmas.

1264
01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:31.332
- There it is.
- All right.

1265
01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:34.040
All right. so the. uh. snow
globe. what's the deal with that?

1266
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.290
The "glossy pig"?

1267
01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:37.957
Glaskäfig. It's German
for "glass cage."

1268
01:28:37.958 --> 01:28:39.249
Well. what do you think
Gryla's trying to do?

1269
01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.207
- Is there...
- Shh.

1270
01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:43.207
<i>...Gryla's trying...?</i>

1271
01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:47.041
We got to go.

1272
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:50.665
Mum.

1273
01:28:50.666 --> 01:28:53.707
Ready for another test.

1274
01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:54.999
Good.

1275
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.457
The next name on the list?

1276
01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.915
No.

1277
01:28:59.916 --> 01:29:02.332
I have a better idea.

1278
01:29:04.458 --> 01:29:06.540
She said she wanted
to punish them all.

1279
01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:08.582
It seems like the Glaskäfig
was just for one person.

1280
01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:13.082
Is it possible she can make more of
'em with. like. witch magic or...

1281
01:29:13.083 --> 01:29:14.915
She would need billions of them.

1282
01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:17.458
She's immensely powerful. but
that's a big lift for a conjurer.

1283
01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.624
Okay.

1284
01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:22.499
I mean. honestly. the only place that has
that kind of manufacturing capacity...

1285
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.874
Look out!

1286
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:50.750
This something that
happens to you a lot?

1287
01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:55.374
Unexplained player piano in
the middle of a German highway.

1288
01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:57.833
No. This is rare.

1289
01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:05.957
It's for you.

1290
01:30:05.958 --> 01:30:08.499
Well. I'm not
touching that thing.

1291
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.082
Just get back in the truck. We'll
drive right around the haunted piano.

1292
01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:13.665
We have to open it.

1293
01:30:13.666 --> 01:30:16.374
This... this is how it starts.

1294
01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.416
You're doing it.

1295
01:30:27.625 --> 01:30:31.166
Oh. see?

1296
01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.999
Dylan.

1297
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.249
<i>Did you send me this stupid present
instead of coming to this thing?</i>

1298
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.957
Wait. what?

1299
01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.999
Because if you don't want
to come. I don't care.

1300
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.082
I wanted to be
there. I really did.

1301
01:30:46.083 --> 01:30:48.207
- Then something...
<i>- Just stop. okay?</i>

1302
01:30:48.208 --> 01:30:51.457
<i>You don't have to pretend because
my mom is guilt-tripping you.</i>

1303
01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:52.874
I'm not pretending.

1304
01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:55.165
<i>- I really want to find a way...</i>
- You never come to anything.

1305
01:30:55.166 --> 01:30:56.957
Yeah. I... I know.

1306
01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:58.290
- I know.
<i>- Whatever.</i>

1307
01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:01.665
<i>I got to go. Just don't send
me any more stupid gifts. okay?</i>

1308
01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:04.165
W-Wait. wait. Dylan.
what'd you mean by that?

1309
01:31:04.166 --> 01:31:05.332
<i>This thing.</i>

1310
01:31:07.041 --> 01:31:09.290
- Dylan. don't touch that. Wait.
- No. don't.

1311
01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:11.165
Do you seriously think
that there's anything...

1312
01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.832
Dylan. listen to
me. Put that down.

1313
01:31:12.833 --> 01:31:14.749
<i>Because I'm here
to tell you that...</i>

1314
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.165
What is this?

1315
01:31:16.166 --> 01:31:17.458
What's going on?

1316
01:31:21.666 --> 01:31:22.957
What's happening?

1317
01:31:22.958 --> 01:31:25.125
Put that down!

1318
01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:28.582
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

1319
01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:29.875
I don't know.

1320
01:31:34.333 --> 01:31:36.166
Jack.

1321
01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:39.708
It's my kid.

1322
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.707
Find me.

1323
01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:56.999
Dad?

1324
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.082
- Dad! What's going on?
- Dylan.

1325
01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:00.375
Where are we?

1326
01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:04.624
Oh. my God.

1327
01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:07.750
Oh. my God.

1328
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.040
It worked.

1329
01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:19.207
Mm. Jack O'Malley.

1330
01:32:19.208 --> 01:32:21.290
Level Four.

1331
01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:24.582
What a perfect way to
start my collection.

1332
01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:27.416
Bring production online.

1333
01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:52.415
Tonight. I will deliver one of these
to every single deviant on the list.

1334
01:32:52.416 --> 01:32:55.499
And when they wake up
and open their gift.

1335
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.582
they'll join my collection.

1336
01:32:57.583 --> 01:33:01.582
and the world will be in
the hands of the righteous.

1337
01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:02.833
Finally.

1338
01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:07.083
Tonight. I make the ride.

1339
01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:11.457
Director. we have Drift.

1340
01:33:11.458 --> 01:33:12.790
What happened?

1341
01:33:12.791 --> 01:33:14.415
What do you know
about the Glaskäfig?

1342
01:33:14.416 --> 01:33:16.790
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison the naughty.

1343
01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.290
Krampus has it. Why?

1344
01:33:18.291 --> 01:33:20.290
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

1345
01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:21.874
<i>And I think she's trying to
punish everyone on the list.</i>

1346
01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:22.957
Wait. Slow down.

1347
01:33:22.958 --> 01:33:24.374
O'Malley just got globed

1348
01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:26.249
<i>- and disappeared.</i>
- What?

1349
01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:27.457
His kid. too.

1350
01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:29.249
Oh. dear Lord.

1351
01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:31.416
<i>- Run O'Malley's tag.</i>
<i>- Yes. Director.</i>

1352
01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:36.207
Zoe. I think she's trying to
mass-produce the Glaskäfig.

1353
01:33:36.208 --> 01:33:37.999
<i>- How could she possibly do that?</i>
- Think about it.

1354
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.707
<i>What's the one place that's
capable of something like that?</i>

1355
01:33:40.708 --> 01:33:42.082
The North Pole?

1356
01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.207
But Nick's not there. The
complex runs on his power.

1357
01:33:44.208 --> 01:33:46.249
That can't be it.

1358
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:48.582
- Unless...
<i>- Unless he never left.</i>

1359
01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:52.625
- But the snowcat. the jet.
<i>- Drones. diversions.</i>

1360
01:33:54.458 --> 01:33:55.874
Nick is still there.

1361
01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:59.583
Director. I am not picking up a
signal for O'Malley's tracker.

1362
01:34:01.625 --> 01:34:03.624
Because he's under the dome.

1363
01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:05.874
<i>But I've been talking
to your team all night.</i>

1364
01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:07.791
You have?

1365
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.915
<i>Try Partridge.</i>

1366
01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:15.166
- Connect to Partridge.
- Yes. Director.

1367
01:34:17.208 --> 01:34:19.999
<i>- Hi. Cal.
- Hey. How you holding up. MC?</i>

1368
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.457
Well. I can't sleep.

1369
01:34:21.458 --> 01:34:25.040
I'm just keeping myself
busy baking cookies for him.

1370
01:34:25.041 --> 01:34:26.457
For when he comes home.

1371
01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:27.999
Well. he's gonna love that.

1372
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.290
What do you got baking?

1373
01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:33.291
Just pulled out a fresh
batch of macaroons.

1374
01:34:35.916 --> 01:34:37.333
He'll love that.

1375
01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:40.582
Hang in. I'll keep you posted.

1376
01:34:40.583 --> 01:34:42.500
<i>Thanks.</i>

1377
01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:45.374
That's not her.

1378
01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:46.665
What do you mean?

1379
01:34:46.666 --> 01:34:48.208
<i>Nick hates macaroons.</i>

1380
01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:51.457
They're shape-shifters.

1381
01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:52.957
<i>The Witch. the Lads.</i>

1382
01:34:52.958 --> 01:34:54.666
They're all shape-shifters.

1383
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.499
The North Pole has been taken.

1384
01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:07.082
They're onto us.

1385
01:35:07.083 --> 01:35:08.707
Where are we?

1386
01:35:08.708 --> 01:35:11.665
- What's happening?
- Okay. okay. okay. okay. Now. listen.

1387
01:35:11.666 --> 01:35:15.207
Now. I know what
this is gonna sound like.

1388
01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:17.708
Basically...

1389
01:35:19.916 --> 01:35:25.374
Santa is missing. and that
giant lady is a witch.

1390
01:35:25.375 --> 01:35:30.249
and she got the snow globes from
a giant demonic Christmas...

1391
01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:31.749
goat man.

1392
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:33.707
And now they're gonna
make millions of them

1393
01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:37.165
with that magical
photocopier thing.

1394
01:35:37.166 --> 01:35:39.290
Look. I don't have all
the technical details.

1395
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:44.665
but basically. these globes are meant
to imprison the naughty people forever.

1396
01:35:44.666 --> 01:35:46.875
Forever?

1397
01:35:47.958 --> 01:35:49.957
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1398
01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:58.875
Remember. can't trust anyone.

1399
01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:02.082
I've got a signal.

1400
01:36:02.083 --> 01:36:04.041
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1401
01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.875
- We're close.
- Hey. chief.

1402
01:36:11.375 --> 01:36:12.958
Fred?

1403
01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:17.166
- I'll let the team know that you're back.
- How about you don't?

1404
01:36:22.083 --> 01:36:23.500
Shape-shifters.

1405
01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:26.165
Good tidings.

1406
01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:34.041
It says he
should be right here.

1407
01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:39.416
The old tunnel system.

1408
01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.223
Runs right beneath
the original workshop.

1409
01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:44.124
Let's go.

1410
01:36:45.916 --> 01:36:47.582
Is this happening
because I was ditching?

1411
01:36:47.583 --> 01:36:48.707
What?

1412
01:36:48.708 --> 01:36:50.040
Is it because I
slashed Kevin's tires?

1413
01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:52.207
No. no. no. no. no. no. Dylan.

1414
01:36:52.208 --> 01:36:53.624
You said it was for
naughty people. didn't you?

1415
01:36:53.625 --> 01:36:55.082
Well. she said that. but...

1416
01:36:55.083 --> 01:36:56.790
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1417
01:36:56.791 --> 01:36:58.291
Look at me.

1418
01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:02.582
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1419
01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:05.708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1420
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.999
You're only in here be...

1421
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.916
because of me.

1422
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:14.707
What did you do?

1423
01:37:14.708 --> 01:37:17.207
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1424
01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:19.625
It's... long list.

1425
01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:23.957
But bigger than any of
that. it's what I didn't do.

1426
01:37:23.958 --> 01:37:25.875
What are you talking about?

1427
01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.208
I've been a terrible father.

1428
01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:38.874
- That's not true.
- Yes. it is. It is.

1429
01:37:38.875 --> 01:37:40.582
I haven't been around.

1430
01:37:40.583 --> 01:37:43.624
I told myself I was doing you
a favor. which is bullshit.

1431
01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:47.166
It was bad for you. and
it was terrible for me.

1432
01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:51.332
I've made some mistakes.
pal. I know that.

1433
01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:53.750
But I also know that
I can do better.

1434
01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.957
And I know that's
easier said than done.

1435
01:37:56.958 --> 01:38:00.625
I know it's a lot of work.
and I hope it's not too late.

1436
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.791
Every day. every decision
is an opportunity.

1437
01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:13.500
And I want to start
taking some of those.

1438
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.957
So I'm not asking
you to believe me.

1439
01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:20.625
I'm just asking for you
to... give me a chance.

1440
01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:24.540
I know I may never be the
greatest father in the world.

1441
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:27.290
but I know I can do better.

1442
01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:30.832
and I'm telling you
right now that I promise

1443
01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:33.124
I will never stop trying.

1444
01:38:59.125 --> 01:39:01.208
What just happened?

1445
01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.000
I think I just got
a little bit nicer.

1446
01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:10.540
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1447
01:39:10.541 --> 01:39:13.332
First. we got to find
somebody. Come on.

1448
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:23.332
Ow.

1449
01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:25.291
Cal.

1450
01:39:26.833 --> 01:39:30.000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now. what would it be?

1451
01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.749
Wonder Woman.

1452
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:33.999
It's him.

1453
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.249
You all right?

1454
01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:37.374
Yeah. Yeah.

1455
01:39:37.375 --> 01:39:38.915
It's good to see you.

1456
01:39:38.916 --> 01:39:40.916
Dad?

1457
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.290
Buddy. come here.

1458
01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:44.790
I want you to meet some friends.

1459
01:39:44.791 --> 01:39:47.957
Cal. Zoe. this is my son Dylan.

1460
01:39:47.958 --> 01:39:49.832
The one and only Dylan.

1461
01:39:49.833 --> 01:39:51.313
Your dad's told me
so much about you.

1462
01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:54.915
Welcome to the North Pole.

1463
01:39:54.916 --> 01:39:57.249
Huh?

1464
01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:59.999
I can't believe she got the old
Quatuplicator back online again.

1465
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.832
This thing has been out of
commission since the late 1800s.

1466
01:40:01.833 --> 01:40:04.249
This thing was cranking out
snow globes like rat turds.

1467
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:06.249
and it just stopped like
somebody pulled the plug.

1468
01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:07.415
Cal. we saw her.

1469
01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:09.499
She said she was gonna
do the ride herself.

1470
01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.374
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1471
01:40:11.375 --> 01:40:12.540
to everybody on the list.

1472
01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:15.290
That's impossible. The
sleigh won't lift off.

1473
01:40:15.291 --> 01:40:16.540
Without him.

1474
01:40:16.541 --> 01:40:18.125
We can't let that
sleigh take off.

1475
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.749
There's a subterranean
access point to the hangar.

1476
01:40:23.333 --> 01:40:24.500
Wait.

1477
01:40:32.333 --> 01:40:33.499
Chief.

1478
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:34.832
Garcia.

1479
01:40:34.833 --> 01:40:36.125
Cal.

1480
01:40:39.208 --> 01:40:40.750
Ma'am.

1481
01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:43.499
Where is he?

1482
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.333
Gryla. stop!

1483
01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:26.290
I was just leaving.

1484
01:41:27.958 --> 01:41:29.798
- Go. Take him.
- Come with me. Dylan. Got him.

1485
01:41:46.625 --> 01:41:48.540
Come on!

1486
01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:49.625
Go!

1487
01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:16.333
Hyah!

1488
01:44:19.166 --> 01:44:20.665
Nick.

1489
01:44:20.666 --> 01:44:22.750
Come on. Red. I got you.

1490
01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.540
Red?

1491
01:44:34.541 --> 01:44:37.207
Come back to me. Come
back to me. boss.

1492
01:44:37.208 --> 01:44:38.833
Wake up.

1493
01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:43.790
Nick? Nick!

1494
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:45.707
It's Cal.

1495
01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:58.916
Cal!

1496
01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:12.500
Holy shit.

1497
01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:15.625
Jack.

1498
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.625
Run.

1499
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:23.707
No way. man.

1500
01:45:23.708 --> 01:45:26.082
For a guy like me. there's
worse ways to go out

1501
01:45:26.083 --> 01:45:28.000
than by trying to
save Santa Claus.

1502
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:32.458
Gryla!

1503
01:45:33.541 --> 01:45:34.750
It's time for you to go.

1504
01:45:36.208 --> 01:45:38.832
Oh. I'll go.

1505
01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:42.124
but I'm taking him with me.

1506
01:45:42.125 --> 01:45:44.957
You're not taking him anywhere.

1507
01:45:44.958 --> 01:45:48.624
His power has been
wasted for far too long.

1508
01:45:48.625 --> 01:45:51.833
The punishing begins tonight.

1509
01:45:52.916 --> 01:45:55.499
You're gonna have to
go through me first.

1510
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.332
With pleasure.

1511
01:45:57.333 --> 01:45:59.665
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1512
01:45:59.666 --> 01:46:01.749
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1513
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:03.415
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.

1514
01:46:03.416 --> 01:46:05.457
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1515
01:46:05.458 --> 01:46:08.790
Ooh. ooh. ah. ah.
Ooh. ooh. cha. cha.

1516
01:46:17.958 --> 01:46:22.999
You imbeciles have no idea how
to talk to a woman like this.

1517
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.041
A real woman.

1518
01:46:27.166 --> 01:46:28.750
She's my ex.

1519
01:46:30.666 --> 01:46:32.832
Hello.

1520
01:46:32.833 --> 01:46:33.999
My love.

1521
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.665
Get out of here. Krampus.

1522
01:46:35.666 --> 01:46:38.832
I can't do that.

1523
01:46:38.833 --> 01:46:43.665
And lovely as it is to
see your miserable face.

1524
01:46:43.666 --> 01:46:48.416
my brother has somewhere to be.

1525
01:46:57.458 --> 01:46:59.415
Just like old times.

1526
01:47:31.083 --> 01:47:33.791
Haven't you had enough?

1527
01:47:35.375 --> 01:47:37.999
If you want to take him.

1528
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.333
you're gonna have to kill me.

1529
01:47:41.416 --> 01:47:43.415
Gladly.

1530
01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:45.540
Your sacrifice
will mean nothing.

1531
01:47:45.541 --> 01:47:47.375
Gryla!

1532
01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:52.207
Enough!

1533
01:47:53.375 --> 01:47:57.040
Any last words for your
most faithful warrior?

1534
01:47:57.041 --> 01:47:59.208
Only one.

1535
01:48:00.666 --> 01:48:03.124
<i>Kavalame!</i>

1536
01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:11.333
Merry Christmas. Witch.

1537
01:48:25.625 --> 01:48:27.249
No!

1538
01:48:36.375 --> 01:48:37.957
No.

1539
01:48:41.708 --> 01:48:43.415
- No!
- Well. look at you.

1540
01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:45.499
Oh. shut up!

1541
01:48:48.583 --> 01:48:49.916
Nick.

1542
01:48:51.333 --> 01:48:52.416
You okay?

1543
01:48:54.375 --> 01:48:55.708
Yeah.

1544
01:48:59.625 --> 01:49:01.249
What took you so long?

1545
01:49:19.583 --> 01:49:22.790
Well. look what
the cat dragged in.

1546
01:49:22.791 --> 01:49:25.958
Let's not get mushy.

1547
01:49:27.041 --> 01:49:28.290
Thank you. brother.

1548
01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:34.374
Merry Christmas...

1549
01:49:34.375 --> 01:49:36.250
brother.

1550
01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:39.707
You want to maybe
stick around a while?

1551
01:49:42.958 --> 01:49:44.708
Don't push it.

1552
01:49:47.291 --> 01:49:48.500
Get to work.

1553
01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:52.124
And you...

1554
01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:53.958
I want a rematch.

1555
01:50:00.583 --> 01:50:03.000
Happy Krampusnacht!

1556
01:50:09.666 --> 01:50:11.332
Oh. my God.

1557
01:50:11.333 --> 01:50:12.707
Honey. where are you?

1558
01:50:12.708 --> 01:50:14.832
<i>Mom.
you're not gonna believe this.</i>

1559
01:50:16.833 --> 01:50:18.540
<i>T plus six minutes.</i>

1560
01:50:18.541 --> 01:50:19.957
Sky Train.
this is Partridge.

1561
01:50:19.958 --> 01:50:21.540
Back in the chair
and back on track.

1562
01:50:21.541 --> 01:50:23.290
<i>Good
to have you back. ma'am.</i>

1563
01:50:29.708 --> 01:50:31.707
We are currently
six minutes behind schedule.

1564
01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:34.249
so we're gonna run this preflight
