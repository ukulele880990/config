<i>- Answer the phone.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.718
<i>I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?</i>

Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

Hey. Hey. big fella.
Excuse me.

Come help me make up these
beds in the living room!

10
00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:46.633
Excuse me. Ma'am!

11
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.110
- Hi. Hey. son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

12
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:52.739
Big fella! Hey! Hey. hey. hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

13
00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:57.202
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh. it's crazy.

14
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.579
- Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

15
00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.706
- Uh-huh.
- That's right. Her family's there.

16
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.708
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

17
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.752
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready. are you?

18
00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:10.590
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie. but the big kids can.

19
00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.468
- Why can't I?
- Kevin. I'm on the phone.

20
00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:16.054
When do you come back?
Not till then?

21
00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.516
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

22
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.852
Kevin. if Uncle Frank says no...

23
00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:25.146
then it must be really bad.

24
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.398
No. we're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him--

25
00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:29.943
Hey. hey. hey! Get off.
Kevin. out of the room.

26
00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.445
Hang up the phone and make me.
why don't ya?

27
00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:33.313
Oh. this kid.

28
00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.474
Kate. did you by any chance pick
up a voltage adapter thing?

29
00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.451
I didn't have time to do that.

30
00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:40.453
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

31
00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:43.456
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad. nobody'll let me do anything.

32
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.458
I've got something
for you to do.

33
00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:48.002
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

34
00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:50.964
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

35
00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.071
<i>He was in the garage again
playing with the glue gun.</i>

36
00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:54.158
Didn't we talk about that?

37
00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.262
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

38
00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.514
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

39
00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.391
My new fishhooks?

40
00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:06.229
I can't make ornaments out of the old ones.
with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

41
00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.191
- Peter.
- Come on. Kevin. Out.

42
00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.777
Peter. Kate. do you guys
have a voltage adapter?

43
00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:16.114
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter.
- Oh. you're getting heavy.

44
00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:18.366
Go pack your suitcase.

45
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.620
Pack my suitcase?

46
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.206
- Do you know where the shampoo is. Fuller?
- I don't live here.

47
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.750
A house with this many people.
there's no shampoo?

48
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:30.003
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah. but they don't live here.

49
00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:32.797
<i>- Tracy. did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.</i>

50
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:36.176
<i>- Excuse me. miss. Are your parents here?</i>
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

51
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.178
- Hi!
- Hi!

52
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.804
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.848
- Do they live here?
- No.

54
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.895
No. Why should they? All kids. no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

55
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.065
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done this once in my whole life.

56
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.443
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

57
00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:56.237
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin. "tough."

58
00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:59.073
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

59
00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.659
Shake his hand and say.
"Congratulations. you're an idiot"?

60
00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.704
- I'm not an idiot!
- Oh. really? You're completely helpless!

61
00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:07.498
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right. Kev.

62
00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:11.461
Excuse me. puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than
you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

63
00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:15.131
- I hope you didn't just pack crap. Jeff.
- Shut up. Linnie.

64
00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.133
Do you know what
I should pack?

65
00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:20.553
Buzz told you. cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

66
00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:23.556
Listen. Kev. what are
you so worried about?

67
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.434
<i>You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.</i>

68
00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.771
<i>You're what the French call
les incompetents.</i>

69
00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:33.858
- What?
- Bombs away!

70
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.908
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

71
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:45.745
If he has something to drink.
he's gonna wet the bed.

72
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.623
This house is so full of people.
it makes me sick!

73
00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:51.751
When I grow up and get married.
I'm livin' alone!

74
00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:54.671
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

75
00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.507
<i>I'm livin' alone!</i>

76
00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:02.262
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

77
00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:06.766
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

78
00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:11.437
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

79
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:14.190
Some don't.

80
00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:16.192
But they got nude beaches.

81
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:19.320
Not in the winter.

82
00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:27.745
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock. phlegm-wad?

83
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:31.374
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

84
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.459
If he has something to drink.
he'll wet the bed.

85
00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:38.173
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

86
00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:43.136
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

87
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.641
Who is he?

88
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:53.104
<i>You ever heard
of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!</i>

89
00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:55.148
<i>- No.
- That's him.</i>

90
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.986
<i>Back in '58. he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...</i>

91
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:03.448
with a snow shovel.

92
00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:06.868
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

93
00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:10.455
Well. if he's the Shovel Slayer.
how come the cops don't arrest him?

94
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.498
Not enough evidence to convict.

95
00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:15.126
<i>They never found the bodies.</i>

96
00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:17.462
<i>But everyone around here
knows he did it.</i>

97
00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:21.299
Now it'll just be a matter of time
before he does it again.

98
00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.384
What's he doin' now?

99
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.430
<i>He walks up and down
the streets every night...</i>

100
00:06:27.514 --> 00:06:29.849
<i>salting the sidewalks.</i>

101
00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:31.893
<i>Maybe he's just trying to be nice.</i>

102
00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.855
No way.

103
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.983
See that garbage can full of salt?

104
00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:42.070
<i>That's where he keeps his victims.</i>

105
00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:45.073
<i>The salt turns the bodies...</i>

106
00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:47.992
<i>into mummies.</i>

107
00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:51.037
- Wow.
- Mummies.

108
00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.418
Look out!

109
00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:31.995
<i>How you kids doin'. huh? Good?</i>

110
00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:34.789
Lot of action
around here today. huh?

111
00:07:34.914 --> 00:07:37.584
Goin' on vacation?
Where you goin'?

112
00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:42.005
<i>Do you hear me or what?
Goin' on a trip?</i>

113
00:07:42.088 --> 00:07:44.174
Where you goin'. kid?

114
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.519
Okay. that's 122.50.

115
00:07:56.603 --> 00:07:58.605
Not for me. kid.
I don't live here.

116
00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:02.650
- Oh. You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

117
00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:06.112
- Hey. pizza's here!
- Here you go. That's 122.50.

118
00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:08.865
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

119
00:08:08.948 --> 00:08:12.202
Hey. listen. uh--

120
00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:15.705
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

121
00:08:15.788 --> 00:08:18.124
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

122
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.252
- Yes.
- Oh. good. 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

123
00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:24.881
- I'd like a word with you. sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

124
00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:28.801
No. no. It's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

125
00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:33.306
We're checking the neighborhood to see
if everyone's taking the proper precautions.

126
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:37.519
Oh. yeah. Well. we have automatic timers
for our lights. locks for our doors.

127
00:08:37.644 --> 00:08:39.729
<i>That's about as well
as anybody can do these days.</i>

128
00:08:39.812 --> 00:08:42.023
- You get some eggnog?
- Come on. Dad.

129
00:08:42.148 --> 00:08:44.025
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

130
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.382
<i>- Eggnog? Listen. are you
gonna be leaving. uh--</i>

131
00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:47.136
<i>- Pizza! Pizza!</i>

132
00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:49.155
Pizza!

133
00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:52.325
<i>Grab yourself a napkin.
You're gonna have to pour your own drinks.</i>

134
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.536
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

135
00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:56.871
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

136
00:08:56.996 --> 00:08:59.457
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

137
00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:03.795
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want
to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

138
00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:07.056
Honey. the pizza boy needs
$122.50. plus a tip.

139
00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:08.074
For pizza?

140
00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:10.009
<i>Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.</i>

141
00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:12.637
- Frank. you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

142
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.598
Forget it. Frank.
We have cash.

143
00:09:15.682 --> 00:09:18.351
<i>You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.</i>

144
00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:21.437
Did anyone order me
a plain cheese?

145
00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:23.982
Oh. yeah. we did.
But if you want any...

146
00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:27.318
somebody's gonna have
to barf it all up. 'cause it's gone.

147
00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:30.947
<i>Fuller!
Go easy on the Pepsi.</i>

148
00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:41.124
Kev! Kevin. get a plate.

149
00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:50.049
Wow!

150
00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:52.969
The passports! Watch it!

151
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:56.181
<i>Help me out here!</i>

152
00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:59.100
Let's get these passports
out of here.

153
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:02.687
<i>- Kevin. get off of him!
- You moron!</i>

154
00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:06.357
Are you okay. honey?
Come here. Are you all right?

155
00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:08.234
What is the matter with you?

156
00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:11.237
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

157
00:10:11.362 --> 00:10:13.615
<i>He knows I hate sausage
and olives and--</i>

158
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.159
Look what you did.
you little jerk!

159
00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:32.300
- Kevin. get upstairs right now.
- Why?

160
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:35.637
- Kevin. you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

161
00:10:35.762 --> 00:10:37.472
- Kevin. upstairs!
- Say good night. Kevin.

162
00:10:37.597 --> 00:10:41.851
- Good night. Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

163
00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:44.270
Why do I always get treated
like scum?

164
00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:46.731
Oh. I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

165
00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:48.733
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

166
00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:52.487
My brother-in-law drove in
from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

167
00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:55.198
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

168
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.325
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

169
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.869
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

170
00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:01.871
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

171
00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:05.875
<i>and his kids are still going to school here.
and I guess he missed the whole family.</i>

172
00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:08.586
<i>He's giving us this trip to Paris
so we can be together.</i>

173
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:12.465
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes. we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

174
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.843
Excellent. Excellent.

175
00:11:14.968 --> 00:11:18.096
If you'll excuse me. this one's
out of sorts. I'll be right back.

176
00:11:18.221 --> 00:11:21.015
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband already.

177
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.309
<i>And don't worry
about your home.</i>

178
00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:25.812
It's in good hands.

179
00:11:28.648 --> 00:11:32.151
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one that has to make trouble.

180
00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:35.321
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

181
00:11:35.446 --> 00:11:40.034
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs. dummy.

182
00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:42.704
- The third floor?
- Go.

183
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:46.040
- It's scary up there.
- Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

184
00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:49.335
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

185
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.629
<i>He'll pee all over me.
I know it.</i>

186
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.756
Fine. We'll put him
somewhere else.

187
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.384
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:59.012
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

189
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.100
Everyone in this family hates me.

190
00:12:04.184 --> 00:12:06.436
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

191
00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:10.190
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family! Families suck!

192
00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.484
Stay up there. I don't want to
see you for the rest of the night.

193
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.237
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

194
00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:19.032
<i>And I don't want to see
anybody else either.</i>

195
00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:21.117
I hope you don't mean that.

196
00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:25.163
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow
morning and you didn't have a family.

197
00:12:25.288 --> 00:12:28.791
<i>- No. I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.</i>

198
00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:33.296
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

199
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.445
I wish they would all just disappear.

200
00:13:54.294 --> 00:13:57.630
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

201
00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:09.475
Peter!

202
00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:11.519
We slept in!

203
00:14:28.286 --> 00:14:31.289
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

204
00:14:31.414 --> 00:14:34.834
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando. Florida.

205
00:14:34.918 --> 00:14:38.588
Well. actually. first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

206
00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:41.257
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

207
00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:45.136
Do you know if it's cold there?
Do these vans get good gas mileage?

208
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.181
Gee. kid. I don't know.
Hit the road.

209
00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:53.186
Heather. do a head count.
Make sure everyone's in the vans.

210
00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.188
Where are the passports
and tickets?

211
00:14:55.313 --> 00:14:57.190
I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

212
00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:59.192
How fast does this thing go?

213
00:14:59.317 --> 00:15:03.238
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have four-wheel drive?

214
00:15:03.363 --> 00:15:07.534
Look. I told you before. kid.
don't bother me. Now beat it.

215
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:16.960
Come on. Hurry up.

216
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:22.549
- Line up in front off the van.
- Did you take my batteries?

217
00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:25.009
<i>- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!</i>

218
00:15:25.093 --> 00:15:27.762
<i>Shut up.
I gotta take a head count.</i>

219
00:15:27.887 --> 00:15:31.975
- One. two. three. four. five--
- Eleven. 92. 12.

220
00:15:32.058 --> 00:15:34.477
Buzz. don't be a moron.

221
00:15:34.561 --> 00:15:37.772
Six. seven. eight...

222
00:15:37.897 --> 00:15:40.441
nine. 10. 11.

223
00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:43.736
Okay. Half in this van. half in this van.
Come on. Let's go.

224
00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.364
Have a good trip.

225
00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.491
Bring me back something French.

226
00:15:51.244 --> 00:15:55.164
There's no way on earth we're gonna
make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

227
00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:58.585
- Think positive. Frank.
- You be positive. I'll be realistic.

228
00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:00.587
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- What?

229
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.672
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

230
00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:06.259
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma
Bell a couple of days to patch 'em up.

231
00:16:06.384 --> 00:16:08.803
- Especially around the holidays.
- Okay. thanks.

232
00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:12.265
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven. including me.

233
00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:17.145
Five boys. six girls. four parents. two
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

234
00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:51.846
This way!

235
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:55.433
<i>- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?</i>

236
00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:58.102
No. you just made it.

237
00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:02.315
- Single seats only in coach. Take whatever's free.
- Thank you.

238
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.609
I get a window seat!

239
00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:09.030
<i>You kids are in coach.
We're up here.</i>

240
00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:11.866
<i>Here are your seats. Five "A"and "B"
and four "A"and "B. "</i>

241
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:14.869
- I'll take your coats.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:16.871
Fasten your seat belts. please.

243
00:17:16.996 --> 00:17:19.541
- Champagne. please. It's free. isn't it?
- Oh. yes.

244
00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:23.294
- We made it.
- Do you believe it?

245
00:17:23.378 --> 00:17:25.547
Hope we didn't forget anything.

246
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.927
What are you doing
out of costume?

247
00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:14.929
Now get back and get dressed.

248
00:18:15.054 --> 00:18:17.140
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.

249
00:18:17.223 --> 00:18:19.142
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

250
00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:21.352
<i>- Oh. no.
- Yes.</i>

251
00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:24.522
<i>It's disgraceful!
How can you allow a man--</i>

252
00:18:29.944 --> 00:18:32.697
<i>What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed!</i>

253
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.451
<i>But it's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.</i>

254
00:18:36.576 --> 00:18:38.453
<i>I ought to take this cane and--</i>

255
00:18:38.578 --> 00:18:43.166
<i>Julia. get some black
coffee and plenty of it.</i>

256
00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:45.210
Black with a little cream.

257
00:18:45.293 --> 00:18:47.504
Mom?

258
00:18:52.509 --> 00:18:55.261
Thank you.

259
00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:58.556
- That's real crystal. It's real.
- Yeah. So?

260
00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:02.894
- Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em!
- I can't do that.

261
00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:04.938
Put them in your purse!

262
00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:09.150
Uh. yeah. yeah. fill it up. fill it up.
Fill it up. please.

263
00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:11.152
Thank you.

264
00:19:11.277 --> 00:19:14.656
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

265
00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:16.658
No. the kids are fine.

266
00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:20.912
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the family
station wagon. and it wasn't to France.

267
00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:24.332
We used to have to go over
to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

268
00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:26.726
The kids are okay. They're
having the time of their lives.

269
00:19:26.752 --> 00:19:27.318
Yeah.

270
00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:30.380
Hello?

271
00:19:31.548 --> 00:19:33.508
Mom?

272
00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:37.262
Dad?

273
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.393
Mom? Dad?

274
00:19:45.436 --> 00:19:48.147
Where are you guys?

275
00:19:48.273 --> 00:19:50.233
Buzz?

276
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.611
Buzz?

277
00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:58.575
Buzz?

278
00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:04.205
Megan?

279
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.877
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

280
00:20:09.002 --> 00:20:11.963
Rod? Uncle Frank?

281
00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:14.382
Uncle Frank. is this a joke?

282
00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:19.179
<i>Megan? Linnie?</i>

283
00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:23.766
Is this a joke?

284
00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:51.461
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

285
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:12.065
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

286
00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:33.753
I made my family disappear.

287
00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:37.048
Kevin. you're completely helpless.

288
00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:41.719
<i>You know. Kevin. you're what
the French call les incompetents.</i>

289
00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:45.056
Kevin. I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.

290
00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:48.142
Kevin. you are such a disease.

291
00:21:48.268 --> 00:21:50.436
There are 15 people
in this house...

292
00:21:50.562 --> 00:21:53.356
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

293
00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:56.776
Look what you did.
you little jerk.

294
00:22:00.613 --> 00:22:03.741
I made my family disappear.

295
00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:22.135
I'm free! Free! Free!

296
00:22:32.061 --> 00:22:34.022
Wow!

297
00:22:39.986 --> 00:22:43.698
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

298
00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:47.952
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

299
00:22:48.077 --> 00:22:51.039
Buzz. I'm going through
all your private stuff!

300
00:22:51.164 --> 00:22:54.083
You better come out
and pound me!

301
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.673
Buzz. your girlfriend!
Woof!

302
00:23:49.472 --> 00:23:51.432
Who is it?

303
00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:57.814
It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.

304
00:23:57.897 --> 00:24:01.025
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

305
00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:04.320
<i>All right. Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

306
00:24:04.404 --> 00:24:07.949
<i>- What money?
- Acey said you had some dough for me.</i>

307
00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:11.035
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

308
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.997
Acey said 10%.

309
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.791
Too bad Acey ain't
in charge no more.

310
00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:19.794
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- Guys. I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

311
00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.881
You better come out
and stop me!

312
00:24:22.964 --> 00:24:25.592
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

313
00:24:25.717 --> 00:24:27.385
Hey.

314
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.221
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you. Snakes.

315
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.142
I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...

316
00:24:34.267 --> 00:24:37.353
<i>to get your ugly. yellow...</i>

317
00:24:37.437 --> 00:24:39.564
<i>no-good keister off my property...</i>

318
00:24:39.689 --> 00:24:41.774
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

319
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.444
All right. Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

320
00:24:44.569 --> 00:24:47.071
<i>One. two. ten!</i>

321
00:25:02.378 --> 00:25:04.797
Keep the change.
ya filthy animal.

322
00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:08.009
Mom!

323
00:25:19.354 --> 00:25:21.940
What's the matter?

324
00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:24.442
Honey?

325
00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:28.071
- I have a terrible feeling.
- About what?

326
00:25:29.155 --> 00:25:31.282
That we didn't do something.

327
00:25:31.407 --> 00:25:34.702
Oh. no. you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

328
00:25:34.827 --> 00:25:36.855
<i>We took care of everything.
Believe me. we did.</i>

329
00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:38.189
<i>Did I turn off the coffee?</i>

330
00:25:38.248 --> 00:25:41.125
No. I did.

331
00:25:41.209 --> 00:25:43.211
<i>Did you lock up?</i>

332
00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:45.213
Yeah.

333
00:25:45.338 --> 00:25:47.966
Did you close the garage?

334
00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:53.805
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

335
00:25:59.394 --> 00:26:01.729
No. that's not it.

336
00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:05.108
What else could we be forgetting?

337
00:26:09.028 --> 00:26:11.239
Kevin!

338
00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:40.143
Whoa!

339
00:26:41.186 --> 00:26:44.939
Whoa! Whoa!

340
00:26:53.698 --> 00:26:56.868
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

341
00:26:56.993 --> 00:27:01.414
We'll call as soon as we land. Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

342
00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:05.126
It's horrible. Horrible.
Just horrible.

343
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:08.296
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

344
00:27:08.421 --> 00:27:10.673
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

345
00:27:11.841 --> 00:27:14.052
What kind of mother am I?

346
00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:17.889
<i>If it makes you feel any better.
I forgot my reading glasses.</i>

347
00:27:22.602 --> 00:27:25.230
<i>Five families gone on one block alone.</i>

348
00:27:25.355 --> 00:27:28.233
<i>- They all told me from their own mouths.</i>

349
00:27:28.316 --> 00:27:30.276
<i>It's almost too easy.</i>

350
00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:34.280
Check it out. All the houses
with nobody home...

351
00:27:34.364 --> 00:27:37.492
have automatic timers
on their lights.

352
00:27:37.617 --> 00:27:40.453
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

353
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.458
Number 664 will be going on...

354
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:48.795
right about... now.

355
00:27:50.547 --> 00:27:53.591
- Oh.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

356
00:27:53.716 --> 00:27:56.261
Number 672...

357
00:27:57.554 --> 00:28:00.223
right... now.

358
00:28:00.306 --> 00:28:03.518
<i>-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

359
00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:07.856
671 ... now.

360
00:28:09.983 --> 00:28:13.319
And that's the one. Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

361
00:28:13.444 --> 00:28:15.572
Oh. it's very "G."

362
00:28:15.655 --> 00:28:18.616
Very "G. " huh?
It's loaded.

363
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.160
It's got lots of topflight goods.

364
00:28:21.244 --> 00:28:24.664
<i>- Stereos. VCR's.
- Toys.</i>

365
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:29.252
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry.
Possible cash hoard.

366
00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:33.590
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows?

367
00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:35.884
<i>It's a gem.</i>

368
00:28:36.009 --> 00:28:37.969
Grab your crowbar.

369
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.181
Crowbars up.

370
00:29:40.156 --> 00:29:40.965
Which way?

371
00:29:40.991 --> 00:29:44.227
We'll go around back to the basement.
Follow me.

372
00:30:04.097 --> 00:30:06.182
I thought you said
they were gone.

373
00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:10.103
- They were supposed to leave this morning.
- Let's get out of here.

374
00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:49.184
We have to use the phone. please.

375
00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:52.061
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

376
00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:55.190
Please! Our brother's home alone.

377
00:30:55.315 --> 00:30:58.526
- Give us the phone!
- Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

378
00:30:58.651 --> 00:31:01.613
Peter. I'm gonna call the police.
Why don't you book us a flight home.

379
00:31:01.738 --> 00:31:06.367
Get some change out of here.
Call everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

380
00:31:06.492 --> 00:31:09.662
<i>Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everybody who lives on our street.</i>

381
00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:11.664
Maybe somebody can help us.

382
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:15.877
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

383
00:31:21.007 --> 00:31:24.928
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

384
00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:29.140
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

385
00:31:36.439 --> 00:31:39.317
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

386
00:31:40.777 --> 00:31:44.739
I said.
I'm not afraid anymore!

387
00:31:44.864 --> 00:31:47.700
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore!

388
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.650
Village Police Department.

389
00:32:20.733 --> 00:32:24.279
Hi. Look. I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

390
00:32:24.404 --> 00:32:27.782
Our phones are out of order.
so I'd like somebody to go to our house...

391
00:32:27.907 --> 00:32:29.784
and tell him we're
coming home to get him.

392
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:31.953
Let me connect you with
Family Crisis Intervention.

393
00:32:32.078 --> 00:32:34.914
- It's not a family crisis.
- Hold on.

394
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:40.295
Larry. can you pick up? There's some
lady on hold. sounds kind of hyper.

395
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.131
<i>- What line. Rose?
- Uh. two.</i>

396
00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:45.842
Family Crisis Intervention.
Sergeant Balzak.

397
00:32:45.925 --> 00:32:48.928
I am calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

398
00:32:49.053 --> 00:32:50.930
Has the child been involved
in a violent altercation...

399
00:32:51.055 --> 00:32:53.850
with a drunken and/or mentally ill
member of his immediate family?

400
00:32:53.933 --> 00:32:57.896
- No.
- Has he been involved in a household accident?

401
00:32:58.021 --> 00:33:00.231
I don't know. I don't--
I hope not.

402
00:33:00.356 --> 00:33:02.817
Has the child ingested any poison...

403
00:33:02.942 --> 00:33:05.612
and/or any other object that has become
lodged in his throat?

404
00:33:05.737 --> 00:33:09.324
No. he's just home alone! I would like
somebody to go over to the house...

405
00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.285
and see that he's all right.
just to check on him.

406
00:33:12.368 --> 00:33:15.997
You want us to go to your house
just to check on him?

407
00:33:16.122 --> 00:33:16.806
Yes!

408
00:33:16.832 --> 00:33:19.567
Let me connect you with
the police department.

409
00:33:19.626 --> 00:33:22.128
- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

410
00:33:22.253 --> 00:33:24.672
<i>- Yeah?
- Hyper on two. Hold on. please.</i>

411
00:33:24.797 --> 00:33:28.718
No. please don't hang up.
Please. don't--Any luck?

412
00:33:28.801 --> 00:33:32.430
No. We couldn't get anybody.

413
00:33:32.555 --> 00:33:33.314
<i>Leslie?</i>

414
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.376
<i>I'm sorry. Kate. Nothing but a
bunch of answering machines.</i>

415
00:33:38.603 --> 00:33:42.232
Somebody pick up.
Pick up!

416
00:33:42.315 --> 00:33:44.859
- Hi. ma'am. It's you again.
- Yeah. hi. Look.

417
00:33:44.984 --> 00:33:47.820
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone. and I--

418
00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:51.908
Okay. okay. We'll send a policeman
over to your house to check on your son.

419
00:34:22.146 --> 00:34:24.816
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

420
00:34:24.899 --> 00:34:27.986
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
Ten-four.

421
00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:30.655
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody--

422
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.449
I'm sorry. but there's
no way I can do that.

423
00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:35.451
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

424
00:34:35.535 --> 00:34:38.079
- If you explained this is an emergency.
- I wish I could--

425
00:34:38.204 --> 00:34:40.665
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

426
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:45.086
- That's a relief. Everything here is booked.
- There's nothing to Chicago?

427
00:34:45.211 --> 00:34:48.506
There's nothing to Chicago. New York.
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

428
00:34:48.631 --> 00:34:53.052
- What about a private plane?
- No. I'm sorry. We don't do that.

429
00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:56.139
The only thing they have is a booking
for all of us on Friday morning.

430
00:34:56.222 --> 00:34:58.474
Friday morning?
That's two days away.

431
00:34:58.558 --> 00:35:01.060
Look. honey. the kids are exhausted.
You are exhausted.

432
00:35:01.144 --> 00:35:03.771
There's absolutely nothing more
we can do in this airport.

433
00:35:03.897 --> 00:35:07.984
I say we go to Rob's. we can call the
police. and they can get back to us.

434
00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:11.905
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

435
00:35:11.988 --> 00:35:13.907
<i>Madame. we are doing
everything we can.</i>

436
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.911
If you want to stay at the airport.
maybe we can get you on a standby.

437
00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:21.456
<i>It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.</i>

438
00:35:21.581 --> 00:35:24.667
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

439
00:35:29.756 --> 00:35:33.384
- Bye. I'll miss you.
- Bye.

440
00:35:33.468 --> 00:35:36.429
<i>- Find Kevin.</i>

441
00:35:36.554 --> 00:35:38.515
Don't you get lost.

442
00:35:38.598 --> 00:35:40.725
Good-bye.

443
00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.769
<i>Good-bye. Kate.</i>

444
00:35:56.616 --> 00:36:00.119
I took a shower. washing
every body part with actual soap...

445
00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:04.749
including all my major crevices. including
in between my toes and in my belly button...

446
00:36:04.832 --> 00:36:07.293
which I never did before.
but sort of enjoyed.

447
00:36:07.418 --> 00:36:10.046
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

448
00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:13.299
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

449
00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:17.428
I can't seem to find my toothbrush.
so I'll pick one up when I go out today.

450
00:36:17.512 --> 00:36:19.556
Other than that.
I'm in good shape.

451
00:36:53.923 --> 00:36:55.842
Whoa!

452
00:37:09.772 --> 00:37:12.984
All right!
Buzz's life savings.

453
00:37:40.136 --> 00:37:43.014
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

454
00:37:58.905 --> 00:38:02.450
You know. you're one of the great
cat burglars of the world. Marv.

455
00:38:02.575 --> 00:38:04.457
<i>You think you could keep
it down a little in there?</i>

456
00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:10.041
<i>Hi. you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.</i>

457
00:38:10.124 --> 00:38:14.921
Chuck. this is Peter McCallister again. and
we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.

458
00:38:15.046 --> 00:38:18.132
<i>Let me give you the number here. okay?
The country code is 3-3.</i>

459
00:38:18.258 --> 00:38:20.134
The area code is 1-4.

460
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.472
- And the number is 694-8764.
- Hey. Harry?

461
00:38:24.597 --> 00:38:25.390
Yeah?

462
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:28.585
House we were at last night.
was that the McCallisters?

463
00:38:28.685 --> 00:38:31.104
<i>- Yeah.
- Call me in Paris.</i>

464
00:38:31.229 --> 00:38:33.773
You're right. They're gone.

465
00:38:37.193 --> 00:38:40.029
<i>- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.</i>

466
00:38:42.198 --> 00:38:44.158
<i>Wow.</i>

467
00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:51.249
How may I help you?

468
00:38:51.374 --> 00:38:55.211
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

469
00:38:55.295 --> 00:38:58.089
Well. I don't know.

470
00:38:58.214 --> 00:39:01.968
- It doesn't say. hon.
- Can you please find out?

471
00:39:04.971 --> 00:39:06.973
<i>- Herb!
- Yeah?</i>

472
00:39:07.098 --> 00:39:10.894
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

473
00:39:16.441 --> 00:39:20.737
Do you know. is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

474
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.739
I don't know.

475
00:39:43.593 --> 00:39:48.014
-Just tell him that--
- Oh. hon. you pay for that here.

476
00:39:48.097 --> 00:39:50.016
<i>Why don't you just
tell him it's approved?</i>

477
00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.436
<i>Wait. son. you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?</i>

478
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.522
<i>Son! Hey!</i>

479
00:39:55.605 --> 00:39:59.317
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

480
00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:06.074
Hey! Hey!

481
00:40:08.034 --> 00:40:09.786
Shoplifter!

482
00:40:13.039 --> 00:40:14.874
Hey! Hey. kid!

483
00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:17.585
Come back here!

484
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.421
Watch it!

485
00:40:21.798 --> 00:40:23.591
<i>Come back here!</i>

486
00:40:23.716 --> 00:40:27.595
<i>Stop it. will ya!
Come here!</i>

487
00:40:30.223 --> 00:40:32.392
Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!

489
00:40:39.732 --> 00:40:42.360
Yeehaw!

490
00:41:06.217 --> 00:41:08.178
I'm a criminal.

491
00:41:35.371 --> 00:41:38.082
What's so funny?

492
00:41:38.166 --> 00:41:40.835
<i>What's so funny?
What are you laughin' at?</i>

493
00:41:43.463 --> 00:41:45.465
You did it again. didn't you?

494
00:41:45.548 --> 00:41:48.218
<i>You left the water runnin'. didn't you?</i>

495
00:41:48.301 --> 00:41:51.513
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to do it.

496
00:41:51.638 --> 00:41:53.515
Harry. it's our calling card.

497
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.351
<i>- Calling card.
- All the great ones leave their mark.</i>

498
00:41:56.476 --> 00:41:58.353
We're the "Wet Bandits."

499
00:41:58.478 --> 00:42:01.314
You're sick. you know that?
You're really sick.

500
00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:03.316
- I'm not sick.
- Yes. you are.

501
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:05.360
- I'm not sick!
- That's a sick thing to do!

502
00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:14.802
- We don't need that heat.
- Don't tell me what to do.

503
00:42:14.828 --> 00:42:16.145
I can do it if I want to.

504
00:42:16.246 --> 00:42:18.998
<i>- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.</i>

505
00:42:19.123 --> 00:42:22.210
<i>- Hey. watch out!</i>

506
00:42:28.716 --> 00:42:32.303
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out
for traffic. son. you know?

507
00:42:32.428 --> 00:42:34.848
- Sorry.
- Damn.

508
00:42:34.931 --> 00:42:37.183
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes. little buddy.

509
00:42:37.308 --> 00:42:39.477
<i>Okay. okay.</i>

510
00:42:39.602 --> 00:42:42.897
Merry Christmas.

511
00:42:52.323 --> 00:42:55.702
- What's the matter?
- I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

512
00:42:55.785 --> 00:42:57.704
<i>- Did you see that?
- You ever seen him before?</i>

513
00:42:57.787 --> 00:43:00.498
I saw a hundred kids this week.

514
00:43:00.623 --> 00:43:03.084
Let's see what house
he goes into.

515
00:43:34.741 --> 00:43:36.993
<i>Why is he goin' faster?</i>

516
00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:41.497
I told you something's wrong. I knew
he looked at me weird. Why would he run?

517
00:44:16.908 --> 00:44:20.954
<i>- Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not goin' in there.</i>

518
00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:23.831
<i>- Me neither.
- Ah. let's get out of here.</i>

519
00:44:42.475 --> 00:44:45.603
When those guys come back.
I'll be ready.

520
00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:13.840
<i>- Did they come back?
- From Paris?</i>

521
00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:52.462
<i>We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone by then.</i>

522
00:45:52.545 --> 00:45:56.633
We'd better get out of here
before somebody sees us.

523
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.539
Attention! Attention!

524
00:46:27.622 --> 00:46:31.584
- Look what I have found in "ze" kitchen!
- Frank. those are for later.

525
00:46:31.668 --> 00:46:33.628
Frank?

526
00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:38.883
<i>Mes petites enfants.
do you want a little shrimp. eh?</i>

527
00:46:39.008 --> 00:46:42.220
Oper-- Do you speak English?

528
00:46:42.345 --> 00:46:45.139
<i>Parlez anglais?</i>

529
00:46:45.265 --> 00:46:47.225
Is there-- I mean--

530
00:46:47.308 --> 00:46:52.272
<i>Est ce qui un person
qui parle anglais?</i>

531
00:46:52.355 --> 00:46:55.400
- Did you get anybody?
- I'm looking for my son! Do you know where he is?

532
00:46:55.525 --> 00:47:00.822
I can't find anybody. They've all gone
shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays.

533
00:47:00.947 --> 00:47:03.032
<i>Never mind. Forget it.</i>

534
00:47:03.116 --> 00:47:05.159
This is so pointless.

535
00:47:05.285 --> 00:47:08.997
- What?
- We're here rotting in this apartment.

536
00:47:09.122 --> 00:47:11.291
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

537
00:47:11.416 --> 00:47:13.710
- So?
- You're not at all worried about Kevin?

538
00:47:13.793 --> 00:47:15.712
<i>Why should I be?</i>

539
00:47:15.795 --> 00:47:19.340
He's acted like a jerk too many times.
and this time he caught it in the butt.

540
00:47:19.465 --> 00:47:23.970
But he's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's flipped out?

541
00:47:24.095 --> 00:47:27.265
The little trout can use
a couple of days in the real world.

542
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:29.726
You're not worried that something
might happen to him?

543
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:32.312
No. For three reasons.

544
00:47:32.395 --> 00:47:35.023
I'm not that lucky.

545
00:47:35.148 --> 00:47:37.442
Two: We have smoke detectors.

546
00:47:37.525 --> 00:47:41.487
And "D": We live in the most boring street
in the United States of America...

547
00:47:41.613 --> 00:47:45.992
<i>where nothing even remotely dangerous
will ever happen. period.</i>

548
00:48:13.144 --> 00:48:16.523
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Little Nero's. sir. I have your pizza.</i>

549
00:48:16.648 --> 00:48:19.817
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell outta here.

550
00:48:19.943 --> 00:48:22.695
Okay.

551
00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.989
Um. well. what about the money?

552
00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:27.825
What money?

553
00:48:27.951 --> 00:48:31.371
Well. you have to pay
for your pizza. sir.

554
00:48:31.454 --> 00:48:33.665
<i>Is that a fact?</i>

555
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.959
How much do I owe you?

556
00:48:36.042 --> 00:48:39.337
<i>Uh. that'll be 11.80. sir.</i>

557
00:48:45.718 --> 00:48:49.055
Keep the change.
ya filthy animal.

558
00:48:50.932 --> 00:48:52.851
<i>- Cheapskate.
- Hey.</i>

559
00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:56.729
<i>I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get your ugly...</i>

560
00:48:56.855 --> 00:49:00.149
<i>yellow. no-good keister
off my property...</i>

561
00:49:00.233 --> 00:49:02.443
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

562
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:04.445
<i>One. two. ten!</i>

563
00:49:33.433 --> 00:49:36.436
A lovely cheese pizza
just for me.

564
00:49:39.939 --> 00:49:42.108
<i>To Dallas-Fort Worth.</i>

565
00:49:45.528 --> 00:49:47.906
We have the $500.
the pocket translator...

566
00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.700
the two first-class seats--
that's an upgrade from your coach--

567
00:49:50.783 --> 00:49:54.579
- Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?

568
00:49:54.704 --> 00:49:57.373
- No.
- But who can tell?

569
00:49:57.457 --> 00:50:01.419
<i>- I also have a ring.
- That is beautiful!</i>

570
00:50:01.544 --> 00:50:04.047
Come on. They're boarding.

571
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:07.634
This gal has offered us
two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

572
00:50:07.759 --> 00:50:11.262
Plus a ring. a watch.
a pocket translator. $500 and--

573
00:50:11.387 --> 00:50:14.098
- The earrings. You love the earrings.
- She's got her own earrings.

574
00:50:14.224 --> 00:50:16.851
A whole shoe box full of' em.
Dangley ones.

575
00:50:16.976 --> 00:50:18.937
- Come on. come on.
- No. but--

576
00:50:19.062 --> 00:50:21.064
I'm desperate.

577
00:50:21.147 --> 00:50:23.024
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

578
00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:26.569
From a mother to a mother. please.

579
00:50:28.071 --> 00:50:30.657
<i>- Oh. Ed.
- Please.</i>

580
00:50:30.782 --> 00:50:33.451
<i>Oh. all right.</i>

581
00:50:39.123 --> 00:50:41.125
"Dear Santa Claus.
I got a little sister last year.

582
00:50:41.251 --> 00:50:43.419
This year I'd rather
have some clay dough."

583
00:50:57.517 --> 00:50:59.435
I didn't mean it.

584
00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:02.689
If you come back.
I'll never be a pain in the butt again.

585
00:51:02.814 --> 00:51:05.775
I promise. Good night.

- I don't know.
- I'll give 'em a whirl.

596
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.848
For the kids.

597
00:53:02.183 --> 00:53:04.769
Hold on.
I got a coupon for that.

598
00:53:04.894 --> 00:53:07.564
It was in the paper this morning.

599
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.987
- 19.83.
- Okay.

600
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.617
Are you here all by yourself?

601
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.248
Ma'am. I'm eight years old.
You think I would be here alone?

602
00:53:25.331 --> 00:53:27.667
I don't think so.

603
00:53:27.792 --> 00:53:30.044
- Where's your mom?
- My mom's in the car.

604
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.547
<i>- And where is your father?
- He's at work.</i>

605
00:53:32.672 --> 00:53:35.425
- What about your brothers and your sisters?
- I'm an only child.

606
00:53:35.508 --> 00:53:38.011
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you that.

607
00:53:38.136 --> 00:53:41.139
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a stranger.

608
00:54:19.219 --> 00:54:23.014
Hello. Kevin!

609
00:54:24.307 --> 00:54:27.685
<i>Shut up.</i>

610
00:54:40.698 --> 00:54:42.575
I don't get it.

611
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.370
I mean. right now it looks
like there's nobody home.

612
00:54:45.495 --> 00:54:49.040
Last night the place is jumpin'.

613
00:54:49.165 --> 00:54:52.877
Somethin' ain't right.
Go check it out.

614
00:55:01.469 --> 00:55:03.388
Now?

615
00:55:03.513 --> 00:55:05.390
No. tomorrow. egghead. Now!

616
00:55:05.515 --> 00:55:08.142
<i>Go ahead!</i>

617
00:55:08.226 --> 00:55:10.436

<i>Shit.</i>

619
00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:34.878
- Get the hell outta here.
- All right. Johnny.

620
00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:38.089
<i>- But what about my money?
- What money?</i>

621
00:55:38.214 --> 00:55:40.884
<i>Acey said you had
some dough for me.</i>

622
00:55:41.009 --> 00:55:45.889
<i>- Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?
- Acey said 10%.</i>

623
00:55:45.972 --> 00:55:50.977
<i>- Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.
- What do you mean?</i>

624
00:55:51.102 --> 00:55:54.480
<i>He's upstairs taking a bath.</i>

625
00:55:54.606 --> 00:55:57.275
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

626
00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.277
<i>Hey.</i>

627
00:55:59.402 --> 00:56:02.405
<i>I tell you what
I'm gonna give you. Snakes.</i>

628
00:56:02.488 --> 00:56:06.326
<i>- Snakes?
- I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...</i>

629
00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:08.745
<i>to get your ugly. yellow...</i>

630
00:56:08.828 --> 00:56:13.291

<i>All right. Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.</i>

00:56:16.169 --> 00:56:19.130

<i>Keep the change.

634
00:56:45.532 --> 00:56:46.408
What happened?

635
00:56:46.434 --> 00:56:49.936
I don't know who's in there. but
somebody just got blown away!

636
00:56:49.994 --> 00:56:50.495
<i>- Huh?</i>

637
00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:52.522
Somebody beat us to the job.
They're in there!

638
00:56:52.622 --> 00:56:56.626
Two of' em. They was arguing.
One of' em blew the other one away.

639
00:56:56.709 --> 00:56:58.419
- Who?
- I don't know.

640
00:56:58.503 --> 00:57:00.964
<i>I thought I recognized
one of their voices.</i>

641
00:57:01.047 --> 00:57:04.259
And I know I heard that name
Snakes before.

642
00:57:04.342 --> 00:57:06.845
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.

643
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.055
<i>- I don't know no Snakes.
- Snakes.</i>

644
00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.724
Let's get out of here.

645
00:57:14.143 --> 00:57:16.813
Hold it. hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

646
00:57:16.896 --> 00:57:18.815
We work this neighborhood too.

647
00:57:18.898 --> 00:57:21.693
<i>- Yeah.
- Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...</i>

648
00:57:21.818 --> 00:57:24.821
and they start asking us questions
about a murder in the area.

649
00:57:24.904 --> 00:57:28.032
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with their questions?

650
00:57:29.909 --> 00:57:31.870
That's a good idea.

651
00:57:31.995 --> 00:57:35.415
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

652
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.418
He sounded like a snake.

653
00:57:42.505 --> 00:57:45.592
<i>Everything's full.</i>

654
00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:47.594
Everything's full?

655
00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:49.929
I'm very sorry.
but it is Christmas Eve.

656
00:57:50.054 --> 00:57:52.182
What about another airline?

657
00:57:57.604 --> 00:58:00.565
Nothing available.
May I help you get a hotel room in the city?

658
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.984
<i>Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.</i>

659
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.219
<i>I can't wait that long.</i>

660
00:58:04.277 --> 00:58:08.698
I'm terribly sorry. ma'am. but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

661
00:58:12.869 --> 00:58:15.997
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go. people to see.

662
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.417
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

663
00:58:19.542 --> 00:58:23.546
<i>I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.</i>

664
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:28.092
I have been from Chicago to Paris
to Dallas to--Where the hell am I?

665
00:58:28.218 --> 00:58:30.220
Scranton.

666
00:58:30.303 --> 00:58:32.972
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

667
00:58:33.097 --> 00:58:36.476
And now that I'm this close.
you're telling me it's hopeless?

668
00:58:36.601 --> 00:58:40.230
- I'm sorry.
- No. No. no. no. no way. This is Christmas!

669
00:58:40.313 --> 00:58:42.232
The season of perpetual hope!

670
00:58:42.315 --> 00:58:43.106
<i>Ma'am. if I--</i>

671
00:58:43.132 --> 00:58:46.135
<i>If I have to get out on
your runway and hitchhike...</i>

672
00:58:46.236 --> 00:58:48.154
if it costs me everything I own...

673
00:58:48.279 --> 00:58:51.115
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself...

674
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:54.410
I am going to get home
to my son.

675
00:58:54.494 --> 00:58:57.797
<i>Ma'am. if there was anything at
all I could do for you today--</i>

676
00:58:57.823 --> 00:58:58.648
Do it.

677
00:58:58.748 --> 00:59:01.334
<i>- Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.</i>

678
00:59:01.459 --> 00:59:03.878
- What?
- Excuse me.

679
00:59:03.962 --> 00:59:09.676
<i>Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see you
for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.</i>

680
00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:12.971
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

681
00:59:13.096 --> 00:59:15.682
We got a crisis ourselves.

682
00:59:15.807 --> 00:59:19.227
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

683
00:59:19.352 --> 00:59:22.772
Polka king of the Midwest?

684
00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:28.403
The Kenosha Kickers?

685
00:59:28.486 --> 00:59:30.154
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

686
00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.116
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized--

687
00:59:33.199 --> 00:59:36.160
Anyways. uh. I had
a few hits a few years ago.

688
00:59:36.244 --> 00:59:39.539
Uh. that's why. you know--
"Polka. Polka. Polka"?

689
00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:44.127
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

690
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:47.672
"Yamahoozie Polka. "
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

691
00:59:47.797 --> 00:59:50.425
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

692
00:59:50.508 --> 00:59:53.928
Yeah. Yeah. We--
Some fairly big hits for us.

693
00:59:54.012 --> 00:59:56.639
- You know. in the early '70s. you know?
- Oh.

694
00:59:56.723 --> 00:59:59.350
Yeah. we sold
about 623 copies of that.

695
00:59:59.475 --> 01:00:02.103
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

696
01:00:02.187 --> 01:00:04.355
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

697
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.608
Anyway. I'm rambling on here.

698
01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:09.777
<i>Our flight was canceled.
so we gotta drive.</i>

699
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:13.448
So. uh. see the guy in the yellow jacket
over there by the Budget sign?

700
01:00:13.531 --> 01:00:17.285
<i>He's gonna rent us a nice big. uh. van.
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.</i>

701
01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:21.664
I heard you had some problems here. uh. gettin'
to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

702
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:25.877
Uh. my son. He--
We left and he's there.

703
01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:30.089
<i>Aw. geez. If you have to get
to Chicago. we'll gladly drive you.</i>

704
01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:32.467
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

705
01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.178
<i>- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not. you know?</i>

706
01:00:35.303 --> 01:00:37.847
<i>- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?</i>

707
01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.807
Sure. You know.
it's Christmastime.

708
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:42.435
Thank you.
Oh. thank you.

709
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.854
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

710
01:00:44.938 --> 01:00:46.856
No. I'd love to.

711
01:01:08.586 --> 01:01:11.464
- Hey. Marv. Marv. Marv.
- What?

712
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:14.050
Look at this.

713
01:01:18.596 --> 01:01:22.976
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

714
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:55.633
Dad. can you come here
and help me?

715
01:02:00.138 --> 01:02:04.392
Remember that kid we saw
the other day? He lives here.

716
01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:07.395
Well. if the kid's there.
the parents gotta be.

717
01:02:07.478 --> 01:02:10.064
He's home alone.

718
01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:20.283
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

719
01:02:20.366 --> 01:02:22.285
- Uh-huh.
- Even with the kid here?

720
01:02:22.368 --> 01:02:24.495
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

721
01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:28.082
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

722
01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:30.877
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house. I wanted it.

723
01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:33.338
<i>So let's take it
one step at a time. okay?</i>

724
01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:36.925
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

725
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:39.969
<i>- 9:00.
- This way it's dark then.</i>

726
01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:43.181
Yeah. Kids are scared
of the dark.

727
01:02:43.306 --> 01:02:46.142
You're afraid of the dark too. Marv.
You know you are.

728
01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:48.937
No. I'm not!

729
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.523
- Yes. you are.
- I'm not. not. not.

730
01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:55.860
<i>- You are so.
- Mom. where are you?</i>

731
01:03:09.249 --> 01:03:11.167
Do you play?

732
01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.336
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

733
01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:15.672
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

734
01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:17.841
Okay.

735
01:03:42.073 --> 01:03:45.493
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

736
01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:49.581
<i>- Hey. nice shoes.
- Oh. thanks.</i>

737
01:03:49.706 --> 01:03:53.334
Is he still here? It's really important
that I see him.

738
01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:58.715
He's getting in his car. I guess
if you hurry. you can catch him.

739
01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:03.261
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris Kringle
a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

740
01:04:03.386 --> 01:04:06.472
What's next?
Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

741
01:04:06.598 --> 01:04:09.184
Santa. hold on!

742
01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:11.394
Can I talk to you for a minute?

743
01:04:11.477 --> 01:04:14.480
If you make it quick. Santa's got
a little get-together he's late for.

744
01:04:14.606 --> 01:04:16.482
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

745
01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:20.486
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

746
01:04:20.612 --> 01:04:23.239
I'm old enough
to know how it works.

747
01:04:23.323 --> 01:04:26.409
<i>- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.</i>

748
01:04:26.492 --> 01:04:29.537
<i>- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.</i>

749
01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:33.750
I'm Kevin McCallister.
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

750
01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.503
- Do you need the phone number?
- No. that's all right.

751
01:04:36.628 --> 01:04:38.796
Okay.
This is extremely important.

752
01:04:38.922 --> 01:04:43.718
Would you please tell him that. instead of
presents this year. I just want my family back.

753
01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:48.723
<i>No toys. Nothing but Peter.
Kate. Buzz. Megan. Linnie and Jeff.</i>

754
01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:51.017
And my aunt and my cousins.

755
01:04:51.142 --> 01:04:54.312
And. if he has time.
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

756
01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:59.192
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

757
01:04:59.317 --> 01:05:02.237
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

758
01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.448
My elf took the last of the candy canes
home to her boyfriend.

759
01:05:05.573 --> 01:05:07.617
- That's okay.
- No. no. no. Don't be silly.

760
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.703
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

761
01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.997
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

762
01:05:13.122 --> 01:05:16.209
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

763
01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:18.920
I won't. Thanks.

764
01:05:29.848 --> 01:05:32.392
Son of a--

765
01:08:28.568 --> 01:08:30.820
Merry Christmas.

766
01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:32.363
Huh?

767
01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.532
May I sit down?

768
01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:49.506
That's my granddaughter up there.
The little red-haired girl.

769
01:08:51.716 --> 01:08:53.384
She's about your age.

770
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.720
- Do you know her?
- No.

771
01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:58.890
- You live next to me. don't you?
- Yeah.

772
01:08:59.015 --> 01:09:03.478
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

773
01:09:03.561 --> 01:09:07.482
There's a lot of things going around
about me. but none of it's true.

774
01:09:07.565 --> 01:09:09.484
Okay?

775
01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.778
- You been a good boy this year?
- I think so.

776
01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:13.988
<i>Swear to it?</i>

777
01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:16.783
- No.
- Yeah. I had a feeling.

778
01:09:16.908 --> 01:09:20.036
Well. this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

779
01:09:20.119 --> 01:09:23.039
<i>- It is?
- I think so.</i>

780
01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:25.834
<i>- Are you feeling bad about yourself?.
- No.</i>

781
01:09:30.088 --> 01:09:32.340
I've been kind of a pain lately.

782
01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:34.843
<i>I said some things
I shouldn't have.</i>

783
01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:38.221
I really haven't been
too good this year.

784
01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:41.140
<i>- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it...</i>

785
01:09:41.266 --> 01:09:43.393
because I really like my family.

786
01:09:43.518 --> 01:09:46.020
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

787
01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:49.566
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

788
01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:54.153
I think so. How you feel about
your family is a complicated thing.

789
01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.740
Especially with an older brother.

790
01:09:57.866 --> 01:10:02.120
<i>Deep down you always love 'em.
but you can forget that you love 'em.</i>

791
01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:04.914
And you can hurt them.
and they can hurt you.

792
01:10:05.039 --> 01:10:08.751
And that's not just
because you're young.

793
01:10:08.877 --> 01:10:12.088
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

794
01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:14.132
Sure.

795
01:10:14.215 --> 01:10:17.844
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

796
01:10:17.969 --> 01:10:23.600
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

797
01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:27.520
- At church?
- Oh. you're always welcome at church.

798
01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:30.023
I'm not welcome with my son.

799
01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:34.819
<i>Years back. before you and
your family moved on the block...</i>

800
01:10:34.944 --> 01:10:37.405
I had an argument with my son.

801
01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:41.784
- How old is he?
- Oh. he's grown up.

802
01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:44.495
We lost our tempers...

803
01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:47.582
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

804
01:10:47.665 --> 01:10:52.587
He said the same. and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

805
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.507
If you miss him.
why don't you call him?

806
01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:58.301
I'm afraid if I call him.
he won't talk to me.

807
01:10:58.426 --> 01:11:00.637
<i>How do you know?</i>

808
01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.723
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

809
01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:07.519
No offense. but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

810
01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:11.147
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

811
01:11:11.272 --> 01:11:13.483
You're never too old
to be afraid.

812
01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:16.361
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

813
01:11:16.486 --> 01:11:19.906
It's dark. there's weird stuff
down there. and it smells funny.

814
01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:23.409
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

815
01:11:23.535 --> 01:11:25.954
Basements are like that.

816
01:11:26.037 --> 01:11:28.957
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry...

817
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.042
and I found out
it's not so bad.

818
01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:33.419
All this time
I've been worrying about it...

819
01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:35.797
but if you turn on the lights.
it's no big deal.

820
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.343
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

821
01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:42.512
What if he won't talk to me?

822
01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:45.932
At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it...

823
01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:48.643
<i>and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.</i>

824
01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:52.313
I don't care how mad I was.
I'd talk to my dad...

825
01:11:52.397 --> 01:11:54.315
especially around the holidays.

826
01:11:54.399 --> 01:11:57.527
I don't know.

827
01:11:57.652 --> 01:12:00.822
<i>Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.</i>

828
01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:04.284
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

829
01:12:04.409 --> 01:12:06.244
I send her a check.

830
01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:10.665
I wish my grandparents sent that.
They always send me clothes.

831
01:12:10.748 --> 01:12:13.668
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

832
01:12:13.751 --> 01:12:17.046
- Oh. that's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

833
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:20.091
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

834
01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:22.343
- Oh?
- Yeah.

835
01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:26.556
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there
was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

836
01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:29.934
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

837
01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:31.936
You think about what I said.

838
01:12:32.061 --> 01:12:33.813
<i>- All right?
- Okay.</i>

839
01:12:33.938 --> 01:12:37.817
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

840
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.035
- What about you?
- Me?

841
01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:49.120
Yeah. You and your son.

842
01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:52.540
We'll see what happens.

843
01:12:52.624 --> 01:12:55.585
Merry Christmas.

844
01:12:55.668 --> 01:12:57.587
Merry Christmas.

845
01:13:50.348 --> 01:13:54.352
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

846
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.818
Okay. we'll check it out first.
We can always come back for the truck.

847
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.702
How do you wanna go in?

848
01:15:34.786 --> 01:15:38.248
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in. You never know.

849
01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:41.793
Yeah. He's a kid.
Kids are stupid.

850
01:15:43.837 --> 01:15:47.757
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

851
01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:49.884
and the people
who sold it on sale.

852
01:15:49.968 --> 01:15:51.886
Amen.

853
01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:18.621
This is it.
Don't get scared now.

854
01:16:31.926 --> 01:16:34.387
<i>Merry Christmas. little fella.</i>

855
01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:37.056
We know that you're in there...

856
01:16:37.182 --> 01:16:40.059
and that you're all alone.

857
01:16:40.185 --> 01:16:42.812
Yeah. come on. kid. Open up.

858
01:16:42.896 --> 01:16:46.441
It's Santa Claus and his elf.

859
01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:50.111
We're not gonna hurt you.

860
01:16:50.195 --> 01:16:54.157
No. no. We got
some nice presents for you.

861
01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.702
<i>Be a good little fella now
and open the door.</i>

862
01:17:00.622 --> 01:17:03.374
Shoot!

863
01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:07.253
What? What? What?

864
01:17:07.378 --> 01:17:10.381
What? What happened?

865
01:17:10.507 --> 01:17:14.052
Get that little--

866
01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:25.563
Hello.

867
01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:33.363
Yes! Yes!

868
01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:35.532
The little jerk is armed!

869
01:17:35.615 --> 01:17:39.536
That's it! That's it! I'm goin' around
the front! You go down the basement!

870
01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:42.080
That little--

871
01:18:18.366 --> 01:18:20.410
Ow!

872
01:18:42.056 --> 01:18:44.267
That smart aleck.

873
01:20:12.021 --> 01:20:16.943
Oh. boy. that's it. you little--
you little son of a--

874
01:20:17.068 --> 01:20:20.029
Oh. not this time.
you little brat.

875
01:20:23.616 --> 01:20:26.077
You little creep. you.
where are you?

876
01:20:26.202 --> 01:20:30.373
Where are you. you little creep?

877
01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:54.022
Yes! Yes!
Yes. yes. yes. yes!

878
01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:27.555
I'll rip his head off!

879
01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:38.525
You're dead. kid.

880
01:22:25.572 --> 01:22:28.700
Where are you.
you little creep?

881
01:22:44.048 --> 01:22:47.677
<i>Harry! I'm comin' in!</i>

882
01:22:52.307 --> 01:22:54.684
<i>Oh. no. I'm really scared!</i>

883
01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:57.437
It's too late for you. kid.
We're already in the house.

884
01:22:57.562 --> 01:23:01.608
<i>- We're gonna get you!
- Okay. Come and get me.</i>

885
01:23:01.733 --> 01:23:04.277
Why. you--

886
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.201
Now you're dead!

887
01:23:35.475 --> 01:23:37.977
I'm gonna kill that kid!

888
01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.495
- Marv!
- Harry?

889
01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.622
Why the hell'd
you take your shoes off?

890
01:23:57.747 --> 01:24:00.875
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

891
01:24:02.293 --> 01:24:06.047
I'm up here. you morons!
Come and get me!

892
01:24:08.258 --> 01:24:11.928
You guys give up.
or are you thirsty for more?

893
01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:24.107
<i>- Heads up!
- Huh?</i>

894
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:27.360
Don't worry. Marv. I'll get him for you.

895
01:24:27.485 --> 01:24:30.989
Ow!

896
01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:34.492
Yes!

897
01:24:38.663 --> 01:24:41.374
He's only a kid. Harry.
We can take him.

898
01:24:41.499 --> 01:24:43.459
- Aw. shut up. will ya!
- Oh!

899
01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:46.588
- What is it?
- You're missin' some teeth.

900
01:24:46.671 --> 01:24:50.884
Where? It's my gold tooth.
My gold tooth! I'll kill him!

901
01:24:51.009 --> 01:24:54.387
I'll kill him!

902
01:24:54.512 --> 01:24:57.307
You bomb me
with one more can. kid...

903
01:24:57.390 --> 01:25:01.561
and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!

904
01:25:04.022 --> 01:25:06.149
911 Emergency.

905
01:25:06.232 --> 01:25:08.985
Help. My house is being robbed.

906
01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:13.656
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

907
01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:18.912
Watch it. You never know
what's up there.

908
01:25:19.037 --> 01:25:21.915
There he is!

909
01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:26.169
Ah! I got ya!

910
01:25:26.252 --> 01:25:29.631
I got him. Harry!
Harry. I got him!

911
01:25:29.714 --> 01:25:32.800
<i>Harry. get up! Give me a hand!</i>

912
01:25:32.884 --> 01:25:37.055
<i>Ow! I got him!</i>

913
01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.642
Harry. help me! Get up!

914
01:25:40.767 --> 01:25:43.520
<i>I got him!</i>

915
01:26:22.058 --> 01:26:26.896
- What are you doing. Marv?
- Harry. don't move.

916
01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:30.942
- Marv?
- Don't... move!

917
01:26:31.067 --> 01:26:34.362
<i>Marv. what are you doing?
Marv--</i>

918
01:26:37.448 --> 01:26:41.035
Did I get him?
Did I get him?

919
01:26:41.119 --> 01:26:43.454
Where is it?
Where is it?

920
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:46.749
Never mind did you get it!
How do you like it? Huh?

921
01:26:46.833 --> 01:26:50.628
You jerk! Get that kid!
Go on! Get the kid!

922
01:26:54.007 --> 01:26:57.427
Whoa! Whoa!

923
01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:00.972
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

924
01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:04.225
Whoa! Whoa!

925
01:27:16.779 --> 01:27:18.907
Where'd he go?

926
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:21.034
Maybe he committed suicide.

927
01:27:21.159 --> 01:27:23.286
<i>Down here.
you big horse's ass!</i>

928
01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:26.331
Come and get me
before I call the police!

929
01:27:26.456 --> 01:27:28.625
- Let's get him!
- Wait. Wait.

930
01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:30.668
That's just what
he wants us to do--

931
01:27:30.793 --> 01:27:34.255
us to go back downstairs through
his fun house so we get all tore up.

932
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.592
- He's gonna call the cops!
- He's not callin' the-- From a tree house?

933
01:27:37.675 --> 01:27:39.594
Come on.

934
01:27:39.677 --> 01:27:41.971
- Out the window?
- Yeah.

935
01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:44.724
- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared. Marv?

936
01:27:44.849 --> 01:27:47.435
Are you afraid?
Come on. Get out here.

937
01:27:52.023 --> 01:27:53.942
Come on.

938
01:27:57.529 --> 01:28:02.116
<i>Come on!</i>

939
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:08.414
Come on.
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

940
01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.501
- Let's go back. Harry.
- Shut up!

941
01:28:11.584 --> 01:28:14.838
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

942
01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:17.757
<i>Shut it. Marv!</i>

943
01:28:20.218 --> 01:28:23.137
Hey. guys. check this out.

944
01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:26.015
Go back! Go back!

945
01:28:26.099 --> 01:28:27.600
- Go back.
- Okay.

946
01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:56.838
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way. you dope!

947
01:29:14.439 --> 01:29:19.194
- There he is!
- Hey. I'm calling the cops.

948
01:29:19.277 --> 01:29:22.197
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
He wants us to follow him.

949
01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.407
I got a better idea.
Come on.

950
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:45.678
Hiya. pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

951
01:29:45.803 --> 01:29:48.765
Get over here!

952
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:54.312
What are we
gonna do to him. Harry?

953
01:29:54.437 --> 01:29:58.816
We'll do exactly what he did to us.
I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

954
01:29:58.942 --> 01:30:01.069
Then we can smash his face
with an iron!

955
01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:05.073
<i>I'd like to slap him right in the face
with a paint can maybe.</i>

956
01:30:05.156 --> 01:30:07.659
<i>Or shove a nail through his foot.</i>

957
01:30:07.784 --> 01:30:11.037
I'm gonna bite off every one
of these little fingers one at a time.

958
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:22.966
Come on.
Let's get you home.

959
01:30:44.696 --> 01:30:48.867
Wow. This is great.

960
01:30:51.536 --> 01:30:54.372
Nice move-- always leaving
the water running.

961
01:30:54.497 --> 01:30:57.709
Now we know each and
every house that you've hit.

962
01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:04.340
Hey. you know. we've been looking
for you two guys for a long time.

963
01:31:04.424 --> 01:31:07.385
- Yeah.
- Well. remember. we're the Wet Bandits.

964
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:11.639
- Wet Bandits. W-E-T--
- Shut up! Get in the car!

965
01:31:11.723 --> 01:31:14.559
<i>Hey. come on. Come on.</i>

966
01:31:14.684 --> 01:31:17.020
- Hands off the head. pal!
- Come on!

967
01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:15.286
<i>I'm a bad parent.
I'm a bad parent.</i>

968
01:32:15.411 --> 01:32:18.373
You're not. You know. you're beating
yourself up there. you know.

969
01:32:18.456 --> 01:32:21.000
Come on. This happens.
These things happen. You know. you--

970
01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:24.504
Gee. you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at-- Look at us.

971
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:29.050
I mean. we're on the road 48. 49 weeks
out of the year. We hardly see our families.

972
01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:32.512
Uh. Joe over there-- Gosh. you know. he--

973
01:32:32.637 --> 01:32:35.348
<i>He forgets his kids' names
half the time.</i>

974
01:32:35.473 --> 01:32:39.185
<i>Ziggy over there-- He doesn't even--
He's never even met his kid.</i>

975
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:42.981
<i>Eddie-- Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.</i>

976
01:32:43.106 --> 01:32:47.944
Tell me. have you ever gone on vacation
and left your child home?

977
01:32:50.822 --> 01:32:52.866
No.

978
01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:56.411
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

979
01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.746
Yeah. it was--
it was terrible too.

980
01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:02.125
You know. I was all distraught and
everything. You know. the wife and I...

981
01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:06.254
we left the little tyke
there in the funeral parlor all day.

982
01:33:06.337 --> 01:33:10.258
All day. You know. and we went back
at night when we came to our senses.

983
01:33:10.341 --> 01:33:13.845
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all day with a corpse.

984
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:16.598
- Oh!
- Whew. yeah. He was okay. you know.

985
01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:21.603
After six. seven weeks. you know. he
came around and started talking again.

986
01:33:21.686 --> 01:33:26.149
But he's okay. You know. they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

987
01:33:26.232 --> 01:33:28.985
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well. you brought it up.

988
01:33:29.068 --> 01:33:32.113
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Well. I'm sorry I did.

989
01:33:58.014 --> 01:33:59.891
Mom?

990
01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:06.356
Mom?

991
01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.529
Mom?

992
01:34:58.283 --> 01:35:02.328
Kevin? Kevin!

993
01:35:33.318 --> 01:35:35.612
Merry Christmas. sweetheart.

994
01:35:44.829 --> 01:35:47.540
Oh. Kevin. I'm so sorry.

995
01:36:07.101 --> 01:36:09.229
Where is everybody else?

996
01:36:09.354 --> 01:36:13.441
Oh. baby. they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much. but--

997
01:36:13.525 --> 01:36:18.112
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the cab
and drool all over you. did I?

998
01:36:18.196 --> 01:36:20.490
- I don't drool.

1010
01:36:54.399 --> 01:36:56.956
Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

1011
01:36:56.982 --> 01:36:58.469

1012

You? Shopping?

1013

01:37:07.203 --> 01:37:09.539
