Yep. solid gold
shit. maestro.

God. I'm so late.

It's just round the
corner. you'll make it.

54
00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:27.614
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

55
00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:30.074
No. really. I'm just
feeling so rotten.

56
00:04:30.174 --> 00:04:32.844
I love you.
- I know.

57
00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:35.468
I love you even
when you're sick...

58
00:04:35.568 --> 00:04:36.998
and look disgusting.

59
00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:40.585
I know. Now. go or you
will actually miss it.

60
00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:42.685
Right.

61
00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:47.859
Did I mention
that I love you?

62
00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:50.458
Yes. you did. Get out. loser.

63
00:05:07.044 --> 00:05:09.838
Karen. it's me again.

64
00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:12.778
I'm sorry. I literally
don't have...

65
00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:14.918
anybody else to talk to.

66
00:05:15.343 --> 00:05:17.401
Absolutely. Horrible
moment. though.

67
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.622
Can I call you back?

68
00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:20.165
Of course.

69
00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:22.662
Doesn't mean I'm not
terribly concerned...

70
00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:24.169
that your wife just died.

71
00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:26.438
Understood.

72
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.071
Er. bugger off. call me later.

73
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.303
So what's this big news?

74
00:05:34.403 --> 00:05:37.056
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play...

75
00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:38.933
and I'm the lobster.

76
00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:40.685
The lobster?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:44.622
In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

78
00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.807
There was more than
one lobster present...

79
00:05:46.907 --> 00:05:47.984
at the birth of Jesus?

80
00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:50.086
Duh.

81
00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:56.927
Best sandwiches in Britain.

82
00:05:58.177 --> 00:06:00.429
Try my lovely nuts?

83
00:06:02.848 --> 00:06:06.078
Beautiful muffin for
a beautiful lady.

84
00:06:08.813 --> 00:06:10.981
Morning. my future wife.

85
00:06:29.582 --> 00:06:31.526
OK. you can
stop there. Thanks.

86
00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:33.987
I need a
couple of orange gels.

87
00:06:34.087 --> 00:06:36.048
By the way. he
introduced me as John...

88
00:06:36.148 --> 00:06:37.490
but everyone calls me Jack.

89
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.635
Oh. fine. Nice to
meet you. Jack.

90
00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.829
He got me right.
though. I'm just Judy.

91
00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:45.432
Great. Just Judy...

92
00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:53.230
No surprises?
- No surprises.

93
00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:56.800
Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

94
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.412
You admit the prostitutes
were a mistake?

95
00:06:59.512 --> 00:07:00.512
I do.

96
00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:02.306
And it would've
been much better...

97
00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:04.099
if they'd not turned
out to be men?

98
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.243
That is true.

99
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.748
Good luck. kiddo.

100
00:07:33.895 --> 00:07:37.635
Prime
Minister. over here...

101
00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:50.161
Thank you.

102
00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:53.668
Welcome. Prime Minister.

103
00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:56.148
Woh. I must work
on my wave.

104
00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.167
How are you?

105
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.363
How are you feeling?
- Erm...

106
00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:02.632
Cool. Powerful.

107
00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.368
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

108
00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:08.121
Yes. I would like that
very much indeed.

109
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.931
Anything to put off...

110
00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.495
actually running
the country.

111
00:08:12.933 --> 00:08:14.777
This is Terence.
He's in charge.

112
00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:15.877
Morning. sir.

113
00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:16.729
Good morning.

114
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.630
I had an uncle
called Terence.

115
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.770
Hated him. I think
he was a pervert.

116
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.968
But I very much like
the look of you.

117
00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:25.195
This is Pat.
- Hello. Pat.

118
00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.764
Good morning. sir.
I'm the housekeeper.

119
00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:30.434
Oh. right. I should be
easier than the last lot.

120
00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:33.353
No nappies. no teenagers.
no scary wife.

121
00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:36.273
And this is Natalie.
She's new. like you.

122
00:08:36.373 --> 00:08:40.085
Hello. Natalie.
- Hello. David. I mean. sir.

123
00:08:40.168 --> 00:08:42.446
Shit. I can't believe
I've just said that.

124
00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:44.625
And now I've gone
and said 'shit'.

125
00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.241
Twice. I'm so sorry. sir.

126
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:47.755
You could've said 'fuck'...

127
00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:49.703
and we'd have been
in real trouble.

128
00:08:49.803 --> 00:08:52.499
Thank you. sir. I
had a premonition

129
00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.374
I was gonna fuck up
on my first day.

130
00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:58.269
Oh. piss it.

131
00:08:58.352 --> 00:09:00.225
Right. I'll get my things...

132
00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:03.090
and then let's fix
the country. shall we?

133
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.400
Yeah. I can't see why not.

134
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.691
It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

135
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.818
Yes. I did.
- I just went 'blurh'.

136
00:09:22.918 --> 00:09:25.196
Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

137
00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:28.632
Yeah. I'm in here.
OK. Good. Thank you.

138
00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:30.716
Ah.

139
00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:37.098
Oh. no.

140
00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:39.351
That is so inconvenient.

141
00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:43.959
In the presence of God.

142
00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:46.299
Peter and Juliet have
given their consent...

143
00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.091
and made their
marriage vows...

144
00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:48.927
to each other.

145
00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:50.808
They've declared
their marriage...

146
00:09:50.908 --> 00:09:52.097
by the giving of rings.

147
00:09:52.197 --> 00:09:53.993
I therefore proclaim...

148
00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.728
that they are
husband and wife.

149
00:10:02.082 --> 00:10:03.197
And you resisted...

150
00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:05.026
the temptation
for surprises.

151
00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:07.253
Yeah. I'm mature now.

152
00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:19.973
Love. love. love

153
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.020
Love. love. love...

154
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:28.507
Love. love. love...
- Did you do this?

155
00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:31.610
Er. no.

156
00:10:31.694 --> 00:10:35.906
Love. love. love. love

157
00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:40.894
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

158
00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:43.038
Oh. it...

159
00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:45.357
There's nothing
you can sing...

160
00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:46.734
that can't be sung

161
00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:48.617
There's nothing
you can say...

162
00:10:48.717 --> 00:10:50.988
but you can learn
how to play the game

163
00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:54.590
It's easy

164
00:10:55.883 --> 00:10:58.261
All you need is love

165
00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:03.141
All you need is love

166
00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:09.814
All you need is love. love

167
00:11:10.773 --> 00:11:13.192
Love is all you need...

168
00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:17.822
Look. it's Pikey.

169
00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:31.653
Hello. What the hell
are you doing here?

170
00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:34.613
Oh. I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

171
00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:36.516
The lady of the house
let you in. did she?

172
00:11:36.616 --> 00:11:37.616
Yeah.

173
00:11:37.716 --> 00:11:41.094
Lovely. obliging girl.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:41.178 --> 00:11:42.845
I thought I'd pop
back and see...

175
00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:44.456
if she's better. This is good.

176
00:11:44.556 --> 00:11:45.556
Oh.

177
00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:48.894
Listen. erm. I've
been thinking.

178
00:11:48.977 --> 00:11:51.048
I think we ought to
take Mum out for...

179
00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:53.382
her birthday on Friday.
What do you think?

180
00:11:53.482 --> 00:11:55.948
I just feel we've been
bad sons this year.

181
00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.095
Sounds fine. A bit
boring but fine.

182
00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.138
Hurry up. big boy.

183
00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:03.593
I'm naked and I want
you at least twice...

184
00:12:03.693 --> 00:12:05.693
before Jamie gets home.

185
00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:17.725
I am so
happy to see you.

186
00:12:18.422 --> 00:12:21.482
Delicious delicacy?
- Er. no. thanks.

187
00:12:26.764 --> 00:12:29.016
Taste explosion?

188
00:12:41.112 --> 00:12:43.197
Food?
- No. thanks.

189
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.308
Yeah. a bit dodgy. isn't it?

190
00:12:45.408 --> 00:12:49.036
Looks like a dead
baby's finger. Oooh.

191
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.539
Oh. Tastes like it. too.

192
00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.335
I'm Colin. by the way.

193
00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:59.921
I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

194
00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:02.407
What do you do. Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

195
00:13:02.507 --> 00:13:04.409
Ever do weddings?
- Yes. I do.

196
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:07.230
They should've asked
you to do this one.

197
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.330
They did.

198
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.817
God. I wish you hadn't
have turned it down.

199
00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:11.917
I didn't.

200
00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:14.312
Right.

201
00:13:16.813 --> 00:13:19.116
I've worked out why I
can't find true love.

202
00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:20.216
Why is that?

203
00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:22.761
English girls. They're
stuck up. you see.

204
00:13:22.861 --> 00:13:25.436
And I am primarily
attractive to girls...

205
00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:27.599
who are cooler.
game for a laugh.

206
00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:29.349
Like American girls.

207
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:31.937
So I should just
go to America.

208
00:13:32.037 --> 00:13:34.051
I'd get a girlfriend
there instantly.

209
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:35.105
What do you think?

210
00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:37.458
I think it's crap. Colin.

211
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:39.318
That's where you're wrong.

212
00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:40.912
American girls
would dig me...

213
00:13:41.012 --> 00:13:42.404
with my cute British accent.

214
00:13:42.504 --> 00:13:44.660
You don't have a
cute British accent.

215
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.617
Yes. I do. I'm
going to America.

216
00:13:46.717 --> 00:13:49.062
Colin. you're a
lonely. ugly arsehole.

217
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.162
Accept it.

218
00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.218
Never. I am Colin.
God of Sex.

219
00:13:52.318 --> 00:13:55.209
I'm just on the wrong
continent. that's all.

220
00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:56.458
Bit of quiet...

221
00:13:56.558 --> 00:13:59.380
while we finish
the lighting. guys.

222
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.841
The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

223
00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:05.344
Judy. could you take
the top off this time?

224
00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:07.492
Lighting need to know
when we're gonna...

225
00:14:07.592 --> 00:14:09.640
see the. erm. nipples
and when we're not.

226
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.740
Yes. OK. Right.

227
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.309
At least it's nice
and warm in here.

228
00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:14.811
Not always the case. is it?

229
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:17.103
I was standing in
for Brad Pitt once...

230
00:14:17.203 --> 00:14:18.648
on Seven Years In Tibet...

231
00:14:18.748 --> 00:14:20.942
Yes. yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

232
00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:22.153
Guys. time's tight...

233
00:14:22.253 --> 00:14:24.028
and we have to
get the actors in.

234
00:14:24.128 --> 00:14:26.239
Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

235
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.895
Right. let's have
another look at that. please.

236
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.593
Can you just put your
hands on her breasts?

237
00:14:46.693 --> 00:14:48.970
OK. yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

238
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.070
I'll warm them up.

239
00:14:53.657 --> 00:14:56.535
And massage them. please.
- Right.

240
00:15:01.998 --> 00:15:05.858
It's junction 13 that's
just murder. isn't it?

241
00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.338
Total gridlock this morning.

242
00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:16.013
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

243
00:15:16.096 --> 00:15:18.473
Some of her requests.

244
00:15:18.557 --> 00:15:20.981
for instance. that
I should bring

245
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:24.254
Claudia Schiffer as my
date to the funeral.

246
00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:28.191
I was confident she
expected me to ignore.

247
00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:31.930
But others she was
pretty damn clear about.

248
00:15:32.778 --> 00:15:36.773
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen.

249
00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:39.702
I said. 'Over my dead body. '

250
00:15:39.785 --> 00:15:42.897
And she said. 'No.
Daniel. over mine. '

251
00:15:42.997 --> 00:15:46.125
And as usual. my
darling girl...

252
00:15:47.877 --> 00:15:50.597
and Sam's darling
mum was right.

253
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.611
So she's going to say
her final farewell...

254
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:56.494
to you not through me but.

255
00:15:56.594 --> 00:15:58.637
inevitably.

256
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.974
ever so coolly.

257
00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:05.293
through the
immortal genius...

258
00:16:05.393 --> 00:16:07.171
of the Bay City Rollers.

259
00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:11.025
Bye bye baby.
baby goodbye

260
00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:15.362
Goodbye baby.
baby bye bye

261
00:16:15.445 --> 00:16:17.264
Bye bye baby

262
00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:19.342
Don't make me cry

263
00:16:19.442 --> 00:16:22.494
Goodbye baby.
baby bye bye

264
00:16:22.577 --> 00:16:26.498
You're the one girl
in town I'd marry

265
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:31.920
Girl I'd marry you
now if I were free

266
00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:37.050
I wish it could be

267
00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:41.054
I could love you
but why begin it?

268
00:16:41.137 --> 00:16:44.182
Cos there ain't
any future in it

269
00:16:44.265 --> 00:16:47.811
She's got me but
I'm not free so...

270
00:16:49.904 --> 00:16:51.590
Bye bye baby.
baby goodbye

271
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.360
Goodbye baby.
baby bye bye

272
00:16:56.443 --> 00:16:59.238
Bye bye baby.
don't make me cry

273
00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:03.325
Goodbye baby.
baby bye bye

274
00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:05.185
Wish I never
had known you...

275
00:17:05.285 --> 00:17:07.830
Do you love him?

276
00:17:07.913 --> 00:17:09.957
Er. er. what?

277
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.933
No. I-I just thought
I'd ask bluntly...

278
00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:13.777
in case it was the
right question...

279
00:17:13.877 --> 00:17:16.745
and you needed someone
to talk to about it...

280
00:17:16.845 --> 00:17:18.741
and no one had
ever asked you.

281
00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:23.637
No. No. No is the
answer. Absolutely not.

282
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:25.721
...on my finger...

283
00:17:25.764 --> 00:17:27.625
So that's a no. then?

284
00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:29.852
Yes. Erm...

285
00:17:29.935 --> 00:17:32.395
Bye bye baby.
baby goodbye

286
00:17:32.478 --> 00:17:34.505
Goodbye baby.
baby bye bye...

287
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:37.483
This DJ. what
do you reckon?

288
00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:40.445
The worst in history?
- Probably.

289
00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:42.931
I think it all hangs
on the next song.

290
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:45.016
Now here's one
for the lovers.

291
00:17:45.116 --> 00:17:46.738
That's quite a few of you.

292
00:17:46.838 --> 00:17:49.103
I shouldn't be
surprised and a half.

293
00:17:52.915 --> 00:17:55.209
And they called it...

294
00:17:55.293 --> 00:18:00.423
He's done it. it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

295
00:18:00.506 --> 00:18:04.635
Oh. I guess they'll
never know...

296
00:18:08.014 --> 00:18:10.054
Sarah's waiting for you.

297
00:18:10.975 --> 00:18:13.477
Oh. yes. of course. erm...

298
00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:16.521
Great. er. good. good.

299
00:18:16.605 --> 00:18:18.072
How are you doing. Mia?

300
00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:20.759
Settling in fine?
Learning who to avoid?

301
00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:22.859
Absolutely.

302
00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:26.682
Harry?
- Sarah.

303
00:18:26.782 --> 00:18:30.346
switch off your phone
and tell me exactly...

304
00:18:30.446 --> 00:18:34.271
how long it is that
you've been working here.

305
00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:39.586
Two years. seven months.

306
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.322
three days and. I
suppose. what. two hours?

307
00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:45.250
And how long have
you been in love...

308
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.412
with Karl. our enigmatic
chief designer?

309
00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:50.555
Um...

310
00:18:53.516 --> 00:18:55.907
Two years. seven
months. three days...

311
00:18:56.007 --> 00:18:58.462
and. I suppose. an
hour and 30 minutes.

312
00:18:58.562 --> 00:19:00.214
Thought as much.

313
00:19:00.314 --> 00:19:02.045
Do you think
everybody knows?

314
00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:02.341
Yes.

315
00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:04.991
Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

316
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.781
Oh. that is...
that is bad news.

317
00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:11.826
I just thought that
maybe the time...

318
00:19:11.926 --> 00:19:14.816
had come to do
something about it.

319
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:17.815
Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink...

320
00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:20.517
then casually mention
you'd like to marry...

321
00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.737
him and have lots
of sex and babies.

322
00:19:22.837 --> 00:19:25.172
You know that?
- Yes.

323
00:19:26.424 --> 00:19:28.676
And so does Karl.

324
00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:31.203
Think about it.
for all our sakes.

325
00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:33.847
It's Christmas.

326
00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:38.810
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

327
00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:41.062
Thanks. boss.

328
00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:44.941
Hi. Sarah.
- Hi. Karl.

329
00:19:55.618 --> 00:19:58.830
Babe. Absolutely. fire away.

330
00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:02.973
Mia. Mia. would
you turn that down?

331
00:20:04.294 --> 00:20:05.987
What is that?

332
00:20:06.087 --> 00:20:07.851
That was the
Christmas effort...

333
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:09.658
from the once
great Billy Mack.

334
00:20:09.758 --> 00:20:12.660
Oh. dear me. how are
the mighty fallen.

335
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.195
I can safely say that
is the worst record

336
00:20:16.295 --> 00:20:18.374
I've heard this century...

337
00:20:18.474 --> 00:20:20.083
Oh. and coincidentally.

338
00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:22.586
I believe Billy
will be a guest...

339
00:20:22.686 --> 00:20:26.006
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

340
00:20:26.106 --> 00:20:28.650
Welcome back. Bill.

341
00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:30.761
Billy. welcome back
to the airwaves.

342
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:34.014
New Christmas single.
cover of Love Is All Around.

343
00:20:34.114 --> 00:20:36.338
Except we've changed...

344
00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:39.453
the word 'love'
to 'Christmas'.

345
00:20:39.495 --> 00:20:41.548
Yes. is that an
important message...

346
00:20:41.648 --> 00:20:42.648
to you. Bill?

347
00:20:42.748 --> 00:20:45.209
Not really. Mike.

348
00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:47.231
Christmas is a
time for people...

349
00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:49.572
with someone they
love in their lives.

350
00:20:49.672 --> 00:20:52.116
And that's not you?
- That's not me. Michael.

351
00:20:52.216 --> 00:20:54.305
When I was young
and successful.

352
00:20:54.405 --> 00:20:56.160
I was greedy and foolish...

353
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.705
and now I'm left
with no one.

354
00:20:58.805 --> 00:21:00.373
wrinkled and alone.

355
00:21:00.473 --> 00:21:03.167
Wow. Thanks for that. Bill.
- For what?

356
00:21:03.267 --> 00:21:06.087
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

357
00:21:06.187 --> 00:21:07.927
It doesn't often happen here...

358
00:21:08.027 --> 00:21:09.882
at Radio Watford.
I can tell you.

359
00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:12.327
Ask me anything. I'll
tell you the truth.

360
00:21:12.427 --> 00:21:13.720
Best shag you ever had?

361
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.531
Britney Spears.
- Wow.

362
00:21:16.614 --> 00:21:18.850
No. only kidding...

363
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.311
She was rubbish.
- OK. here's one.

364
00:21:21.411 --> 00:21:23.581
How do you think
the new record...

365
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:25.982
compares to your
old. classic stuff?

366
00:21:26.082 --> 00:21:28.490
Come on. Mikey. you
know as well as I do...

367
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.569
the record's crap.

368
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:32.954
But wouldn't it be great...

369
00:21:33.054 --> 00:21:34.823
if number one
this Christmas...

370
00:21:34.923 --> 00:21:37.200
wasn't some smug
teenager...

371
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.138
but an old ex-heroin addict...

372
00:21:39.238 --> 00:21:41.580
searching for a
comeback at any price?

373
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.579
Those young popsters
come Christmas...

374
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.167
will be stretched
out naked...

375
00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:47.920
with a cute bird balancing
on their balls...

376
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.330
and I'll be stuck in
some dingy flat...

377
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.590
with me manager Joe.

378
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.815
ugliest man in the world.

379
00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:55.798
fucking miserable because...

380
00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:58.263
our fucking gamble
didn't pay off.

381
00:21:58.363 --> 00:22:00.967
So if you believe in
Father Christmas.

382
00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:03.602
children. like your
Uncle Billy does.

383
00:22:03.702 --> 00:22:07.456
buy my festering
turd of a record.

384
00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:10.525
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness...

385
00:22:10.625 --> 00:22:12.626
of the moment we
try to squeeze...

386
00:22:12.726 --> 00:22:15.029
an extra syllable
into the fourth line.

387
00:22:15.129 --> 00:22:17.365
I think you're referring to...

388
00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:19.742
'If you really
love Christmas... '

389
00:22:19.842 --> 00:22:23.054
'Come on and let
it snow. ' Ouch.

390
00:22:23.137 --> 00:22:25.164
So. here it is one more time.

391
00:22:25.264 --> 00:22:27.142
the dark horse
for this year's

392
00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:28.542
Christmas number one.

393
00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:30.286
Christmas Is All Around.

394
00:22:30.386 --> 00:22:33.089
Thank you. Billy.
After this. the news.

395
00:22:33.189 --> 00:22:36.759
Is the new prime minister
in trouble already?

396
00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:40.863
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes...

397
00:22:41.864 --> 00:22:44.475
OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

398
00:22:44.575 --> 00:22:47.537
Ah. yes. yes. I fear
this is going to be...

399
00:22:47.637 --> 00:22:49.689
a difficult one to play. Alex.

400
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:51.801
There's a strong
feeling in the party...

401
00:22:51.901 --> 00:22:54.067
we mustn't allow
ourselves to be bullied...

402
00:22:54.167 --> 00:22:56.653
like the last government.
- Here. here.

403
00:22:56.753 --> 00:22:59.463
This is our first
really important test.

404
00:22:59.563 --> 00:23:00.824
let's take a stand.

405
00:23:00.924 --> 00:23:03.762
Right. Right. I
understand that...

406
00:23:03.862 --> 00:23:05.862
but I have decided...

407
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.224
not to. Not this time.

408
00:23:09.307 --> 00:23:11.198
Let's not forget
that America...

409
00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:13.795
is the most powerful
country in the world.

410
00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:17.550
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

411
00:23:18.483 --> 00:23:21.528
Who do you have to
screw round here...

412
00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:24.518
to get a cup of
tea and a biscuit?

413
00:23:29.244 --> 00:23:30.979
Right.

414
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:34.999
Yeah. come in.

415
00:23:39.253 --> 00:23:40.764
These are from
the Treasury...

416
00:23:40.864 --> 00:23:41.864
Uh-huh.

417
00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:45.050
...and these are for you.

418
00:23:45.134 --> 00:23:46.869
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

419
00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:48.645
I was hoping you'd
win. not that

420
00:23:48.745 --> 00:23:51.123
I wouldn't have been
nice to the other bloke.

421
00:23:51.223 --> 00:23:53.914
just always given him
the boring biscuits...

422
00:23:54.014 --> 00:23:55.085
with no chocolate.

423
00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:57.480
Thanks very
much. Thanks...

424
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:00.858
Natalie.

425
00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:07.437
God. come on. get a grip.

426
00:24:07.537 --> 00:24:11.107
You're the Prime
Minister. for God's sake.

427
00:24:12.243 --> 00:24:14.729
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

428
00:24:14.829 --> 00:24:17.319
Oh. I like him. I
can't understand...

429
00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:19.359
why he's not
married. though.

430
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:22.570
You know the type. he's
married to his job.

431
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.900
Either that or gay
as a picnic basket.

432
00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:27.732
Excuse me. Judy.
if you could...

433
00:24:27.832 --> 00:24:29.202
just lower the nipples...

434
00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:31.432
and cheat them a
bit to the left?

435
00:24:31.532 --> 00:24:33.532
OK.

436
00:24:35.058 --> 00:24:37.627
I have to say. Judy.
this is a real pleasure.

437
00:24:37.727 --> 00:24:41.381
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

438
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:43.508
Thank you.
- Oh. well. you know.

439
00:24:43.608 --> 00:24:45.301
And ditto.
- Thank you.

440
00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:47.720
The move again.
please. Judy.

441
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.820
Ooh. sorry.

442
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.475
Oh. God. sorry.
You all right?

443
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.495
Exciting news.
- What?

444
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.506
I've bought a ticket
to the States.

445
00:24:58.606 --> 00:24:59.856
I'm off in three weeks.

446
00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.358
No.
- Yes.

447
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:04.487
To a fantastic place
called Wisconsin.

448
00:25:04.587 --> 00:25:05.571
No.

449
00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:09.299
Yes. Wisconsin babes.
here comes Sir Colin.

450
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:12.437
No. Col. There are a
few babes in America.

451
00:25:12.537 --> 00:25:13.537
I grant you.

452
00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:16.373
but they're going out
with rich. attractive guys.

453
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:19.685
Tone. you're just jealous.

454
00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:21.364
You know perfectly well...

455
00:25:21.464 --> 00:25:23.630
that any bar anywhere
in America...

456
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.803
contains ten girls
more beautiful...

457
00:25:25.903 --> 00:25:28.093
and more likely to
have sex with me...

458
00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.514
than the whole of
the United Kingdom.

459
00:25:30.614 --> 00:25:32.805
That is total
bollocks. You're mad.

460
00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:36.033
No. I'm wise. Stateside
I am Prince William...

461
00:25:36.133 --> 00:25:37.810
without the weird family.

462
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.162
No. Colin. no.
- Yes.

463
00:25:40.246 --> 00:25:41.397
Nyet.
- Da.

464
00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:42.815
Nein.
- Ja. darling.

465
00:25:42.915 --> 00:25:44.424
Right. the Christmas party.

466
00:25:44.524 --> 00:25:46.611
not my favourite
night of the year...

467
00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:49.030
and your unhappy
job to organise.

468
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.091
Tell me.
- It's basic. really.

469
00:25:52.174 --> 00:25:54.427
Find a venue. over-order
on the drinks.

470
00:25:54.527 --> 00:25:55.953
bulk buy the guacamole...

471
00:25:56.053 --> 00:25:58.024
and advise the girls
to avoid Kevin...

472
00:25:58.124 --> 00:26:00.041
if they want their
breasts unfondled.

473
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:04.587
Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean. not children.

474
00:26:04.687 --> 00:26:08.342
But their wives and
girlfriends. et cetera.

475
00:26:08.357 --> 00:26:11.222
Oh. Christ. you haven't
got some horrible...

476
00:26:11.322 --> 00:26:12.954
six-foot. tight-T
- shirt-wearing...

477
00:26:13.054 --> 00:26:14.054
boyfriend?

478
00:26:14.154 --> 00:26:18.014
No. I'll just be hanging
around the mistletoe.

479
00:26:18.114 --> 00:26:20.114
hoping to be kissed.

480
00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:22.996
Really?

481
00:26:23.079 --> 00:26:25.123
Right.

482
00:26:34.507 --> 00:26:36.617
He now spends all
the time in his room.

483
00:26:36.717 --> 00:26:38.328
I mean. he'll be
up there now.

484
00:26:38.428 --> 00:26:40.982
That's not unusual.
My horrid son...

485
00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:42.082
Bernard?

486
00:26:42.182 --> 00:26:45.396
Bernard. Stays in his
room all the time.

487
00:26:45.496 --> 00:26:46.670
Thank goodness.

488
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.000
Yeah. but Karen. this
is all the time.

489
00:26:51.066 --> 00:26:53.524
I'm afraid that
there's something...

490
00:26:53.624 --> 00:26:55.177
really wrong. you know?

491
00:26:55.277 --> 00:26:57.304
I mean. clearly it's
about his mum...

492
00:26:57.404 --> 00:27:00.247
but Christ. he might
be injecting heroin...

493
00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:02.518
into his eyeballs
for all I know.

494
00:27:02.618 --> 00:27:04.353
At the age of 11?

495
00:27:04.453 --> 00:27:07.243
Well. maybe
not his eyeballs. then.

496
00:27:07.343 --> 00:27:08.649
Maybe just his veins.

497
00:27:08.749 --> 00:27:10.732
The problem is his mum...

498
00:27:10.832 --> 00:27:14.572
always used to talk to
him. you know. and...

499
00:27:14.838 --> 00:27:17.845
I don't know. this whole
stepfather thing...

500
00:27:17.945 --> 00:27:20.119
seems suddenly to
somehow matter

501
00:27:20.219 --> 00:27:22.471
like it never did before.

502
00:27:22.554 --> 00:27:25.588
Listen. it was always
going to be...

503
00:27:25.688 --> 00:27:27.334
a totally shit time.

504
00:27:27.434 --> 00:27:29.978
Just be patient.

505
00:27:30.062 --> 00:27:32.380
And maybe check the
room for needles.

506
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.203
And then when he
sometimes does...

507
00:27:35.303 --> 00:27:38.703
come out. it's obvious
he's been crying.

508
00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:50.164
It's just such a
ridiculous waste.

509
00:27:50.248 --> 00:27:54.498
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

510
00:27:54.794 --> 00:27:57.630
I just don't know.

511
00:27:57.714 --> 00:28:00.383
Get a grip.

512
00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:02.635
People hate sissies.

513
00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:04.493
No one's ever
gonna shag you...

514
00:28:04.593 --> 00:28:05.955
if you cry all the time.

515
00:28:06.055 --> 00:28:08.975
Yeah. Absolutely.

516
00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:11.102
Helpful.

517
00:28:18.817 --> 00:28:22.654
So. what's the
problem. Samuel?

518
00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:29.369
Is it just Mum or is it
something else. huh?

519
00:28:30.787 --> 00:28:32.914
Maybe school?

520
00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:36.124
Are you being bullied?

521
00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:39.338
Or is it something worse?

522
00:28:41.173 --> 00:28:43.978
Can you give me
any clues at all?

523
00:28:45.052 --> 00:28:48.247
You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

524
00:28:48.347 --> 00:28:50.874
Even though you won't
be able to help?

525
00:28:50.974 --> 00:28:53.559
Even if that's
the case. yeah.

526
00:28:55.603 --> 00:28:58.022
OK. Well...

527
00:28:59.231 --> 00:29:01.984
truth is. actually...

528
00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:04.929
I'm in love.

529
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:06.597
Sorry?

530
00:29:06.697 --> 00:29:08.738
I know I should be thinking...

531
00:29:08.838 --> 00:29:11.227
about Mum and I am
but I'm in love.

532
00:29:11.327 --> 00:29:12.918
I was before she died...

533
00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:15.565
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

534
00:29:15.665 --> 00:29:18.610
Aren't you a bit
young to be in love?

535
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.694
No.

536
00:29:19.794 --> 00:29:22.797
Ah. well. OK. well...

537
00:29:24.674 --> 00:29:27.176
I'm a little relieved.

538
00:29:28.302 --> 00:29:30.429
Why?
- Because I...

539
00:29:30.513 --> 00:29:32.622
thought it'd be
something worse.

540
00:29:32.722 --> 00:29:35.709
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

541
00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:38.478
Er...

542
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.189
No. you're right.

543
00:29:41.272 --> 00:29:43.400
Total agony.

544
00:30:20.477 --> 00:30:22.772
Night. Sarah.
- Night. Karl.

545
00:30:32.573 --> 00:30:34.616
Yeah. absolutely.

546
00:30:35.743 --> 00:30:37.953
Free as a bird. Fire away.

547
00:31:09.484 --> 00:31:11.611
Alone again.

548
00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.556
Naturally.

549
00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:16.783
I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

550
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:21.454
Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

551
00:31:23.456 --> 00:31:25.024
Thanks.

552
00:31:25.124 --> 00:31:27.168
Natalie.

553
00:31:29.504 --> 00:31:32.214
Erm. I'm starting to feel...

554
00:31:33.423 --> 00:31:35.023
uncomfortable about us...

555
00:31:35.123 --> 00:31:37.119
working so closely
every day...

556
00:31:37.219 --> 00:31:40.144
and me knowing so
little about you.

557
00:31:40.244 --> 00:31:42.539
it seems elitist and wrong.

558
00:31:42.891 --> 00:31:44.668
Well. there's
not much to know.

559
00:31:44.768 --> 00:31:48.255
Well. erm. where do
you live. for instance?

560
00:31:48.355 --> 00:31:50.565
Wandsworth.
The dodgy end.

561
00:31:50.607 --> 00:31:52.844
Ah. my sister lives
in Wandsworth.

562
00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:54.944
Oh.

563
00:31:55.237 --> 00:31:57.764
So which exactly
is the dodgy end?

564
00:31:57.864 --> 00:31:59.413
At the end of
the high street.

565
00:31:59.513 --> 00:32:01.435
Harris Street. near
the Queen's Head.

566
00:32:01.535 --> 00:32:03.254
Oh. yeah. yeah.
that is dodgy.

567
00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:04.354
Hm.

568
00:32:04.454 --> 00:32:06.141
Erm. and you live...

569
00:32:06.241 --> 00:32:08.709
with your husband?
Boyfriend?

570
00:32:10.002 --> 00:32:11.846
Three illegitimate
but charming children?

571
00:32:11.946 --> 00:32:12.945
No.

572
00:32:13.045 --> 00:32:15.273
I've just split up
with my boyfriend. so

573
00:32:15.373 --> 00:32:17.658
I'm back with my mum
and dad for a while.

574
00:32:17.758 --> 00:32:22.054
Ah. Sorry.
- No. it's fine.

575
00:32:22.138 --> 00:32:24.557
I'm well shot of him.

576
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.418
He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

577
00:32:27.518 --> 00:32:29.305
He said no one'd
fancy a girl...

578
00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:31.422
with thighs the size
of tree trunks.

579
00:32:31.522 --> 00:32:34.667
Not a nice guy.
actually. in the end.

580
00:32:35.484 --> 00:32:37.528
No.

581
00:32:44.577 --> 00:32:46.746
You know. erm...

582
00:32:47.413 --> 00:32:49.148
being Prime Minister.

583
00:32:49.248 --> 00:32:51.734
I could just have
him murdered.

584
00:32:51.834 --> 00:32:54.277
Thank you. sir. I'll
think about it.

585
00:32:54.377 --> 00:32:58.298
Do. The SAS are
absolutely charming.

586
00:32:58.381 --> 00:33:02.801
Ruthless. trained killers
are just a phone call away.

587
00:33:08.058 --> 00:33:10.101
Oh. God.

588
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:15.661
Did you have this
kind of problem?

589
00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:20.136
Yeah. course you
did. you saucy minx.

590
00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:23.640
So. let's go. We can
definitely crack this.

591
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.934
Remember. I was
a kid once. too.

592
00:33:26.034 --> 00:33:30.413
So. come on. it's
someone at school. Right?

593
00:33:30.497 --> 00:33:32.356
Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good. good.

594
00:33:32.456 --> 00:33:35.526
And what does she.
he. feel about you?

595
00:33:35.626 --> 00:33:38.545
SHE doesn't even
know my name.

596
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:41.407
And even if she did.
she'd despise me.

597
00:33:41.507 --> 00:33:43.826
She's the coolest
girl in school.

598
00:33:43.926 --> 00:33:48.013
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

599
00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:50.599
Good. Good.

600
00:33:51.892 --> 00:33:54.019
Well.

601
00:33:54.103 --> 00:33:57.163
basically you're
fucked. aren't you?

602
00:34:03.028 --> 00:34:05.489
Hi there and welcome back.

603
00:34:05.572 --> 00:34:07.842
So. three weeks till
Christmas. looks like...

604
00:34:07.942 --> 00:34:09.852
the real competition
is gonna be Blue.

605
00:34:09.952 --> 00:34:11.959
I saw them on the
show last week.

606
00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:14.439
They weren't very
nice about my record.

607
00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:16.916
No. Little scamps.

608
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.420
But very. very
talented musicians.

609
00:34:20.503 --> 00:34:22.946
Yeah. I understand
you've got a prize...

610
00:34:23.046 --> 00:34:24.741
for our competition
winners.

611
00:34:24.841 --> 00:34:26.284
Yes. I have. Ant or Dec.

612
00:34:26.384 --> 00:34:30.388
It's a personalised
felt-tip pen.

613
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:32.081
Oh. great.

614
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:35.935
It's brilliant. It
even writes on glass.

615
00:34:36.019 --> 00:34:38.238
so if you've got
a framed picture.

616
00:34:38.338 --> 00:34:40.757
like. for instance.
this one of Blue.

617
00:34:40.857 --> 00:34:42.982
you can just write on it.

618
00:34:56.663 --> 00:34:59.323
Er. a lot of
kids watching. Billy.

619
00:34:59.423 --> 00:35:00.525
Oh. yeah.

620
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:03.462
Hiya. kids.

621
00:35:03.545 --> 00:35:05.329
Here's an important
message...

622
00:35:05.429 --> 00:35:06.907
from your Uncle Bill...

623
00:35:07.007 --> 00:35:09.134
don't buy drugs.

624
00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.251
Become a pop star...

625
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:14.164
and they give you
them for free.

626
00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:17.054
And I do believe it's
a commercial break.

627
00:35:17.154 --> 00:35:19.044
We'll see you
soon. Bye-bye.

628
00:35:19.144 --> 00:35:23.940
All I want for
Christmas is you...

629
00:35:31.198 --> 00:35:35.326
Look at him. Eurh.
- Just a minute.

630
00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:38.894
Actually. they're not
funny. They're art.

631
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.194
OK. let's say. er.
Thursday. my place.

632
00:35:45.294 --> 00:35:47.739
Great. I've got Juliet
on the other line.

633
00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:49.615
she wants to ask
you a favour.

634
00:35:49.715 --> 00:35:54.679
OK. fine.
- Thanks and. er. be nice.

635
00:35:54.762 --> 00:35:56.087
I'm always nice.

636
00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:59.842
'You know what I mean.
Marky. be friendly. '

637
00:35:59.934 --> 00:36:02.253
I'm always...
- 'Mark? '

638
00:36:02.353 --> 00:36:05.272
Hi. How was
the honeymoon?

639
00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:06.096
It was great.

640
00:36:06.196 --> 00:36:08.092
Thanks for the
gorgeous sendoff.

641
00:36:08.192 --> 00:36:11.762
So. what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour. '

642
00:36:11.862 --> 00:36:13.704
I've just tried the
wedding video...

643
00:36:13.804 --> 00:36:14.806
and it's a disaster.

644
00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.834
'It's come out all
blue and wibbly. '

645
00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:17.934
I'm sorry.

646
00:36:18.034 --> 00:36:19.650
I remember you filming a lot...

647
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.688
and I wondered if
I could look at it.

648
00:36:21.788 --> 00:36:23.857
To be honest. I
didn't really...

649
00:36:23.957 --> 00:36:26.205
Please. All I want
is one shot of me...

650
00:36:26.305 --> 00:36:28.612
in a wedding dress
that isn't turquoise.

651
00:36:28.712 --> 00:36:31.844
I'll have a look but I'm
pretty sure I wiped it.

652
00:36:31.944 --> 00:36:33.617
so don't get any hopes up.

653
00:36:33.717 --> 00:36:36.553
'Must go. '

654
00:36:41.224 --> 00:36:44.002
Any progress with our
matchmaking plans?

655
00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:46.315
No. I've done fuck-all
and never will...

656
00:36:46.415 --> 00:36:48.006
because he's
too good for me.

657
00:36:48.106 --> 00:36:50.150
How true.

658
00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:53.652
Stop.

659
00:36:53.736 --> 00:36:56.456
And of course.
your mobile goes.

660
00:36:56.989 --> 00:36:59.658
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

661
00:37:00.743 --> 00:37:02.504
So. how's the
Christmas party going?

662
00:37:02.604 --> 00:37:03.604
Good.

663
00:37:03.704 --> 00:37:05.873
Think I've found a venue.

664
00:37:05.956 --> 00:37:09.335
What's it like?
- Good. Good.

665
00:37:09.418 --> 00:37:12.935
It's an art gallery.
Full of dark corners...

666
00:37:13.035 --> 00:37:15.035
for doing dark deeds.

667
00:37:16.383 --> 00:37:19.720
Oh. Right.

668
00:37:19.803 --> 00:37:21.895
Good. Well. I
suppose I should...

669
00:37:21.995 --> 00:37:23.958
take a look at
it or something.

670
00:37:24.058 --> 00:37:26.143
You should.

671
00:37:45.244 --> 00:37:46.771
Ah. bonjour. Eleonore.

672
00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:49.691
Bonjour. Monsieur
Bennett. Welcome back.

673
00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:51.859
And this year you
bring a lady guest?

674
00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:55.154
No. There's a change
of situation. Just me.

675
00:37:55.254 --> 00:37:57.199
Oh. Am I sad or not sad?

676
00:37:57.299 --> 00:37:59.659
I think you're not surprised.

677
00:37:59.759 --> 00:38:01.730
And you stay here
till Christmas?

678
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.453
Yeah. yeah.

679
00:38:02.553 --> 00:38:04.712
Good. Well. I find you...

680
00:38:04.812 --> 00:38:07.767
a perfect lady to
clean the house.

681
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.395
This is Aurelia.

682
00:38:10.478 --> 00:38:12.477
Ah.

683
00:38:12.479 --> 00:38:16.525
Er. bonjour. Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

684
00:38:16.608 --> 00:38:20.123
Er. je suis.
er. tr�s heureux...

685
00:38:20.223 --> 00:38:22.223
de vous avoir ici.

686
00:38:22.531 --> 00:38:25.661
Unfortunately. she
cannot speak French.

687
00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:26.852
just like you.

688
00:38:26.952 --> 00:38:28.952
She's Portuguese.

689
00:38:28.954 --> 00:38:31.540
Ah. ah. buongiorno.

690
00:38:31.623 --> 00:38:33.623
Eusebio. er. er...

691
00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:36.600
Er. molto bueno...

692
00:38:37.295 --> 00:38:39.608
I think she's ten
years too young...

693
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:42.284
to remember a footballer
called Eusebio.

694
00:38:42.384 --> 00:38:44.745
And 'molto bueno'
is Spanish.

695
00:38:44.845 --> 00:38:46.330
Right.

696
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.490
Anyway. it's nice
to meet you and...

697
00:38:49.766 --> 00:38:51.960
Can you drive her
home after her work?

698
00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:53.491
Oh. absolutely. yes.

699
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:55.838
Con-Con grande.
er. pl-plesura.

700
00:38:55.938 --> 00:38:58.149
Which is what? Turkish?

701
00:39:05.906 --> 00:39:08.116
Bello.

702
00:39:09.618 --> 00:39:11.662
Er. bella.

703
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:15.207
Er. mon-montagno.

704
00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:17.335
arvarez...

705
00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:22.840
No. right. Silence is golden.

706
00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:27.094
As the Tremeloes said.

707
00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:30.623
Clever guys.

708
00:39:30.723 --> 00:39:33.483
although I think the
original version was...

709
00:39:33.583 --> 00:39:35.961
by Frankie Valli And
The Four Seasons.

710
00:39:36.061 --> 00:39:38.061
Gr-great band.

711
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.068
Oh. shut up.

712
00:39:53.912 --> 00:39:56.081
Mr President.

713
00:39:57.874 --> 00:39:59.154
Over here. sir.

714
00:39:59.254 --> 00:40:01.954
What will you be
talking about?

715
00:40:02.045 --> 00:40:03.697
Mr President. welcome.

716
00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:05.365
It's a pleasure to meet you.

717
00:40:05.465 --> 00:40:06.465
Come through.

718
00:40:06.565 --> 00:40:08.243
I'm sorry your wife
couldn't make it.

719
00:40:08.343 --> 00:40:10.480
So is she. Although
she would have been...

720
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.580
kind of lonely.

721
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.722
Yes. Pathetic. isn't it?

722
00:40:13.806 --> 00:40:16.250
Just never been able
to tie a girl down.

723
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.961
Not sure that politics
and dating go together.

724
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:22.022
Really? I've
never found that.

725
00:40:22.106 --> 00:40:24.374
Yeah. you're still
sickeningly handsome.

726
00:40:24.474 --> 00:40:26.510
whereas I look like
my Aunt Mildred.

727
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.191
Very jealous of your
plane. by the way.

728
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:31.265
Thank you. We
love that thing.

729
00:40:31.365 --> 00:40:33.617
Ah. Natalie. Hi.

730
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:36.395
Morning. ma'am. How's
your day so far?

731
00:40:36.495 --> 00:40:39.164
Excellent.

732
00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:43.073
My goodness.

733
00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:45.571
that's a pretty little
son of a bitch.

734
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:47.715
Did you see those pipes?

735
00:40:47.798 --> 00:40:50.968
Yeah. she's
terrific. At her job.

736
00:40:51.051 --> 00:40:53.191
No. absolutely
not. We cannot...

737
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:55.705
and will not consult
on that either.

738
00:40:55.805 --> 00:40:57.665
That is unexpected.

739
00:40:57.765 --> 00:41:00.226
Well. it shouldn't be.

740
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.463
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

741
00:41:03.563 --> 00:41:06.382
We're being consistent
with their policies.

742
00:41:06.482 --> 00:41:09.302
With all respect. they
were bad policies.

743
00:41:09.402 --> 00:41:11.034
Thanks. Alex. I don't think...

744
00:41:11.134 --> 00:41:12.597
we're making
progress here.

745
00:41:12.697 --> 00:41:16.576
Let's. erm... move
on. shall we?

746
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.498
Well. now. that was
an interesting day.

747
00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:26.226
Sorry if our line was
firm but there's...

748
00:41:26.326 --> 00:41:28.112
no point in tiptoeing
around today.

749
00:41:28.212 --> 00:41:30.949
then just disappointing
you for four years.

750
00:41:31.049 --> 00:41:33.951
I have plans and I plan
to see them through.

751
00:41:34.051 --> 00:41:35.051
Absolutely.

752
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:37.079
There is one final
thing to look at.

753
00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:40.374
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

754
00:41:40.474 --> 00:41:43.043
I'll give you
anything you ask for.

755
00:41:43.143 --> 00:41:45.558
As long as it's
not something

756
00:41:45.658 --> 00:41:47.658
I don't wanna give.

757
00:41:50.984 --> 00:41:52.636
Hi.

758
00:41:52.736 --> 00:41:54.780
Pathetic.

759
00:42:15.508 --> 00:42:18.970
It's great Scotch.

760
00:42:19.053 --> 00:42:22.974
I'll. erm... I'll be going. then.

761
00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.769
Er. Natalie.

762
00:42:26.852 --> 00:42:28.877
I hope to see much
more of you...

763
00:42:28.977 --> 00:42:31.757
as our countries work
toward a better future.

764
00:42:31.857 --> 00:42:34.318
Thank you. sir.

765
00:42:50.626 --> 00:42:52.625
Er. yes. Peter.

766
00:42:52.627 --> 00:42:54.863
Mr President. has it
been a good visit?

767
00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:58.508
Very satisfactory indeed.

768
00:42:58.591 --> 00:43:01.261
We got what we came for...

769
00:43:01.303 --> 00:43:04.789
and our special relationship
is still very special.

770
00:43:04.889 --> 00:43:07.392
Prime Minister?

771
00:43:07.475 --> 00:43:09.477
I love that word
'relationship'.

772
00:43:09.577 --> 00:43:11.963
Covers all manner of
sins. doesn't it?

773
00:43:12.063 --> 00:43:15.973
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

774
00:43:16.776 --> 00:43:18.406
A relationship based on...

775
00:43:18.506 --> 00:43:20.847
the President taking
what he wants...

776
00:43:20.947 --> 00:43:24.233
and casually ignoring
all those things...

777
00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:26.798
that really matter to. erm...

778
00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:30.665
Britain.

779
00:43:30.749 --> 00:43:34.860
We may be a small country
but we're a great one. too.

780
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.635
The country of
Shakespeare.

781
00:43:36.735 --> 00:43:38.155
Churchill. the Beatles.

782
00:43:38.255 --> 00:43:41.450
Sean Connery. Harry Potter.

783
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.495
David Beckham's right foot.

784
00:43:44.595 --> 00:43:47.248
David Beckham's left
foot. come to that.

785
00:43:47.348 --> 00:43:51.335
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

786
00:43:51.435 --> 00:43:53.530
And since bullies only
respond to strength.

787
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.630
from now onward.

788
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.442
I will be prepared
to be much stronger.

789
00:43:58.525 --> 00:44:01.762
And the President
should be prepared for that.

790
00:44:11.664 --> 00:44:13.706
Mr President.

791
00:44:17.835 --> 00:44:19.835
Joe.

792
00:44:20.171 --> 00:44:22.721
It's your sister on line four.

793
00:44:23.758 --> 00:44:26.038
All right. Er. yes.
I'm very busy...

794
00:44:26.138 --> 00:44:28.288
and important. how
can I help you?

795
00:44:28.388 --> 00:44:30.498
Have you gone
completely insane?

796
00:44:30.598 --> 00:44:32.223
You can't always
be sensible.

797
00:44:32.323 --> 00:44:34.294
'You can if you're
Prime Minister. '

798
00:44:34.394 --> 00:44:36.030
It's the Chancellor
on the other line.

799
00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:37.130
It isn't.

800
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.375
'I'll call you back. '
- No. you won't.

801
00:44:41.901 --> 00:44:44.815
The trouble with being
the Prime Minister's...

802
00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:47.765
sister is it puts your
life into perspective.

803
00:44:47.865 --> 00:44:49.434
What did my
brother do today?

804
00:44:49.534 --> 00:44:50.935
He fought for his country.

805
00:44:51.035 --> 00:44:52.283
What did I do?

806
00:44:52.383 --> 00:44:55.580
I made a papier-mach�
lobster head.

807
00:44:55.664 --> 00:44:58.192
What is this we're
listening to?

808
00:44:58.292 --> 00:45:00.544
Joni Mitchell.

809
00:45:00.627 --> 00:45:03.447
I can't believe you still
listen to Joni Mitchell.

810
00:45:03.547 --> 00:45:07.117
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

811
00:45:08.552 --> 00:45:11.185
Joni Mitchell is the
woman who taught...

812
00:45:11.285 --> 00:45:13.582
your cold English
wife how to feel.

813
00:45:13.682 --> 00:45:16.210
Did she? Oh.
well. that's good.

814
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.171
I must write to
her and say thanks.

815
00:45:19.271 --> 00:45:21.506
Which doll for
Daisy's friend Emily?

816
00:45:21.606 --> 00:45:24.271
The one that looks
like a transvestite...

817
00:45:24.371 --> 00:45:26.970
or the one that looks
like a dominatrix?

818
00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.917
'It's
almost enough...

819
00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:30.474
to make you feel patriotic.

820
00:45:30.574 --> 00:45:31.683
'so here's one...

821
00:45:31.783 --> 00:45:34.185
for our arse-kicking
prime minister.

822
00:45:34.285 --> 00:45:36.938
'A golden oldie for
a golden oldie. '

823
00:45:37.038 --> 00:45:39.398
Hold me

824
00:45:39.498 --> 00:45:42.209
I'll give you
all that you need

825
00:45:43.336 --> 00:45:46.380
Wrap your love around me

826
00:45:46.464 --> 00:45:50.117
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

827
00:45:50.217 --> 00:45:51.869
Oh baby

828
00:45:51.969 --> 00:45:56.557
I'll take you down.
I'll take you down

829
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:58.960
Where no one's
ever gone before

830
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.878
And if you want more

831
00:46:00.978 --> 00:46:05.775
If you want
more. more. more

832
00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:08.611
Jump for my love

833
00:46:08.694 --> 00:46:10.555
Jump in

834
00:46:10.655 --> 00:46:12.389
And feel my touch

835
00:46:12.489 --> 00:46:16.601
Jump. if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then

836
00:46:16.701 --> 00:46:19.371
Jump for my love

837
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.001
I'll take you down.
I'll take you down

838
00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:26.528
Where no one's ever gone...

839
00:46:26.628 --> 00:46:28.488
Yeah. erm.

840
00:46:28.588 --> 00:46:30.984
Mary. can we move
the Japanese...

841
00:46:31.084 --> 00:46:33.702
ambassador to four
o'clock tomorrow?

842
00:46:33.802 --> 00:46:37.372
Certainly. sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

843
00:46:44.729 --> 00:46:47.424
Erm. Would you like
the last. er...?

844
00:46:47.524 --> 00:46:49.801
Thank
you very much but no.

845
00:46:49.901 --> 00:46:52.011
If you saw my sister.
you'd understand why.

846
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:54.179
That's all right.
more for me.

847
00:46:54.856 --> 00:46:56.432
Just don't go eating
it all yourself.

848
00:46:56.532 --> 00:46:58.017
you're getting
chubbier every day.

849
00:46:58.117 --> 00:47:00.709
I'm very lucky I've
got a constitution...

850
00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:02.563
where I never
put on weight.

851
00:47:04.832 --> 00:47:08.460
Hello.

852
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:17.761
Oop. Sorry.

853
00:47:21.265 --> 00:47:23.265
Hello?

854
00:47:38.823 --> 00:47:41.367
Thank you.
- Nao.

855
00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:44.604
Eu peco imensa desculpa.
- Oh. no. Hold on.

856
00:47:44.704 --> 00:47:46.452
God. it's half
the book. Oh. no.

857
00:47:46.552 --> 00:47:47.232
Que desastre.

858
00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:50.818
Just leave them. please.
They're not important.

859
00:47:50.918 --> 00:47:53.588
They're not worth it.

860
00:47:53.671 --> 00:47:56.591
Stop. Stop.

861
00:47:56.674 --> 00:47:59.260
Aa-ahh.

862
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.639
It's all just rubbish.

863
00:48:04.307 --> 00:48:06.434
Just leave it.

864
00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:21.573
Oh. God. she's in.

865
00:48:21.657 --> 00:48:24.768
And now she'll think
I'm a total spaz...

866
00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.478
if I don't go in too.

867
00:48:26.578 --> 00:48:29.128
Fuck
- it's cold.

868
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:34.836
Fuck - it's freezing. Fuck.

869
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.235
This
stuff better be good.

870
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.879
It's not worth it.

871
00:48:39.979 --> 00:48:41.743
this isn't bloody
Shakespeare.

872
00:48:41.843 --> 00:48:43.662
I don't
want to drown...

873
00:48:43.762 --> 00:48:45.467
saving some shit
my grandmother...

874
00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:46.498
could have written.

875
00:48:46.598 --> 00:48:48.000
Just stop. Stop.

876
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.773
What
kind of idiot...

877
00:48:49.873 --> 00:48:50.836
doesn't make copies?

878
00:48:50.936 --> 00:48:52.975
I really must do copies.

879
00:48:54.188 --> 00:48:56.340
There'd better not
be eels in here.

880
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.510
Try not
to disturb the eels.

881
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.820
Oh. what the hell is that?

882
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:14.296
Thank you. Thank
you so much.

883
00:49:18.546 --> 00:49:19.837
I know. I'll name...

884
00:49:19.937 --> 00:49:22.033
one of the characters
after you.

885
00:49:22.133 --> 00:49:24.494
Maybe
you could name...

886
00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:26.621
one of the
characters after me.

887
00:49:26.721 --> 00:49:29.849
Or give me 50%
of the profits.

888
00:49:29.932 --> 00:49:33.161
Or I could give you
5% of the profits.

889
00:49:36.146 --> 00:49:39.291
What
kind of book is it?

890
00:49:47.741 --> 00:49:49.826
Romance?
- Yes.

891
00:49:49.909 --> 00:49:50.909
It's. erm...

892
00:49:52.954 --> 00:49:54.147
Ah. er...

893
00:49:54.247 --> 00:49:56.441
Thr
iller... crime...

894
00:49:56.541 --> 00:49:57.889
Sim.

895
00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:00.487
Crime.
Crime. murder.

896
00:50:00.587 --> 00:50:02.280
Frightening?

897
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.467
Er. scary? Yes.
sometimes scary.

898
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.455
And. er. sometimes not.

899
00:50:07.555 --> 00:50:10.615
Mainly scary how
bad the writing is.

900
00:50:19.229 --> 00:50:21.649
Mm.

901
00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:27.363
I'd better
get back to work.

902
00:50:27.446 --> 00:50:28.446
Ah.

903
00:50:28.546 --> 00:50:31.183
Later
you'll drive me home?

904
00:50:31.283 --> 00:50:33.327
Sure.

905
00:50:36.664 --> 00:50:39.625
It's my favourite
time of day...

906
00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:41.752
driving you.

907
00:50:44.046 --> 00:50:46.984
It's
the saddest part...

908
00:50:47.084 --> 00:50:49.084
of my day. leaving you.

909
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.430
Sorry.

910
00:51:23.376 --> 00:51:24.573
(TV 'And coming up...

911
00:51:24.673 --> 00:51:26.821
later this morning.
it's this guy... '

912
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:31.301
There's no beginning.
there'll be no end...

913
00:51:31.384 --> 00:51:32.698
Cos on Christmas...

914
00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:35.120
'. He bad grandad
of rock'n'roll.

915
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.195
'here at 10:30. Do
not switch off. '

916
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.631
Banoffee pie?

917
00:51:45.731 --> 00:51:47.466
No. thanks.

918
00:51:47.566 --> 00:51:49.928
Thank God. You would've
broken my heart...

919
00:51:50.028 --> 00:51:51.011
if you'd said yes.

920
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:54.573
Right. well. lucky you.

921
00:51:54.656 --> 00:51:55.757
Can I come in?

922
00:51:55.857 --> 00:51:58.519
Er. yeah. well.
I'm a bit busy...

923
00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:00.966
I was just passing
and I thought...

924
00:52:01.066 --> 00:52:03.482
we might check that
video thing out.

925
00:52:03.582 --> 00:52:06.485
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie...

926
00:52:06.585 --> 00:52:08.837
or maybe Munchies?

927
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.134
Actually. I was serious
- I don't know...

928
00:52:11.234 --> 00:52:13.282
where it is. I'll
have a look tonight.

929
00:52:13.382 --> 00:52:16.302
Mark. can I say something?

930
00:52:16.385 --> 00:52:18.429
Yeah.

931
00:52:19.513 --> 00:52:21.999
I know you're Peter's
best friend...

932
00:52:22.099 --> 00:52:27.229
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

933
00:52:27.313 --> 00:52:30.191
Look. don't. don't argue.

934
00:52:30.274 --> 00:52:32.652
We've never got friendly.

935
00:52:32.735 --> 00:52:35.221
But I wanted to say. I
hope that can change.

936
00:52:35.321 --> 00:52:37.100
I'm nice. I really am.

937
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.643
Apart from my terrible
taste in pie and...

938
00:52:40.743 --> 00:52:43.896
It would be great if
we could be friends.

939
00:52:43.996 --> 00:52:46.040
Absolutely. Absolutely.

940
00:52:49.669 --> 00:52:52.045
Great.

941
00:52:52.128 --> 00:52:55.073
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video. though.

942
00:52:55.173 --> 00:52:57.525
I had a real search when
you first called...

943
00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:58.994
and couldn't find it so...

944
00:52:59.094 --> 00:53:00.076
This one says...

945
00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:01.997
'Peter and
Juliet's Wedding'.

946
00:53:02.097 --> 00:53:04.374
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

947
00:53:04.474 --> 00:53:09.020
Er. yeah. well... Wow.
That-that could be it.

948
00:53:09.104 --> 00:53:11.798
Do you mind if I...?
- I've probably taped over it.

949
00:53:11.898 --> 00:53:15.468
Almost everything's
episodes of West Wing.

950
00:53:16.111 --> 00:53:18.154
Oh.

951
00:53:19.781 --> 00:53:21.866
Oh. bingo.

952
00:53:23.535 --> 00:53:25.620
That's lovely.

953
00:53:25.704 --> 00:53:27.831
Well done. you.

954
00:53:29.207 --> 00:53:31.418
Oh. that's gorgeous.

955
00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:34.866
Thank you so much. Mark.

956
00:53:34.966 --> 00:53:38.196
this is exactly what
I was hoping for.

957
00:53:43.971 --> 00:53:46.223
I look quite pretty.

958
00:53:53.522 --> 00:53:55.817
You've stayed rather close.

959
00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.037
They're all of me.

960
00:54:56.124 --> 00:54:59.252
Yeah. Yeah.

961
00:54:59.336 --> 00:55:01.380
Yes.

962
00:55:31.576 --> 00:55:33.575
But...

963
00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:36.831
you never talk to me.

964
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:41.375
You always talk to Peter.

965
00:55:43.879 --> 00:55:46.048
You don't like me.

966
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.343
I hope it's useful.

967
00:55:49.427 --> 00:55:52.471
Don't show it
around too much.

968
00:55:52.555 --> 00:55:55.725
Needs a bit of editing.

969
00:55:55.808 --> 00:55:59.478
Look. I've got to
get to a... lunch.

970
00:55:59.562 --> 00:56:01.562
Early lunch.

971
00:56:01.564 --> 00:56:05.134
You can just show
yourself out. can't you?

972
00:56:10.197 --> 00:56:14.534
It's a... self-preservation
thing. you see.

973
00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:28.840
Oh I am what I am

974
00:56:28.923 --> 00:56:31.843
I'll do what I want

975
00:56:31.926 --> 00:56:36.681
But I can't hide

976
00:56:36.765 --> 00:56:38.892
And I won't go

977
00:56:39.851 --> 00:56:42.646
I won't sleep

978
00:56:42.729 --> 00:56:45.607
And I can't breathe

979
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:48.735
Until you're
resting here with me

980
00:56:48.818 --> 00:56:51.404
And I won't leave

981
00:56:51.488 --> 00:56:54.239
And I can't hide

982
00:56:54.323 --> 00:56:57.117
I cannot be

983
00:56:57.201 --> 00:56:59.787
Until you're resting here

984
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.706
And I won't go

985
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:05.584
And I won't sleep

986
00:57:05.668 --> 00:57:08.545
And I can't breathe

987
00:57:08.629 --> 00:57:13.092
Until you're resting
here with me...

988
00:57:13.175 --> 00:57:16.053
Yeah.

989
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:21.575
Annie. my darling.
my dream. my boat.

990
00:57:22.393 --> 00:57:24.561
Ah...

991
00:57:24.645 --> 00:57:26.537
Need you to do
a favour for me.

992
00:57:26.637 --> 00:57:27.214
Of course.

993
00:57:27.314 --> 00:57:30.204
Anything for the
hero of the hour.

994
00:57:31.193 --> 00:57:32.185
Don't ask me why.

995
00:57:32.285 --> 00:57:34.137
and don't read
stuff into this.

996
00:57:34.237 --> 00:57:36.639
it's just a weird
personality thing.

997
00:57:36.739 --> 00:57:39.767
But. erm. you know
Natalie who works here?

998
00:57:39.867 --> 00:57:42.370
The chubby girl?

999
00:57:42.453 --> 00:57:44.480
Ooh. would we
call her chubby?

1000
00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:48.355
I think there's a pretty
sizeable arse there.

1001
00:57:48.455 --> 00:57:50.236
yes. sir. Huge thighs.

1002
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:53.339
Yeah. Well. whatever. erm...

1003
00:57:54.507 --> 00:57:56.968
I'm sure she's a lovely girl...

1004
00:57:57.068 --> 00:57:59.873
but I wonder if
you could. erm...

1005
00:58:00.972 --> 00:58:03.975
redistribute her?

1006
00:58:04.058 --> 00:58:06.102
It's done.

1007
00:58:41.094 --> 00:58:43.221
Hey. Sammo. Can't sleep?

1008
00:58:43.972 --> 00:58:46.083
I got some terrible
news today.

1009
00:58:46.183 --> 00:58:48.183
Let's have it.

1010
00:58:48.226 --> 00:58:49.982
Joanna's going
back to America.

1011
00:58:50.082 --> 00:58:51.255
Your girl's American?

1012
00:58:51.355 --> 00:58:53.856
Yes. she's American.

1013
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.317
And she's not my girl.

1014
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.185
And she's going
back to America.

1015
00:58:58.285 --> 00:59:00.471
That's the end of my
life as I know it.

1016
00:59:00.571 --> 00:59:02.740
That is bad news.

1017
00:59:04.867 --> 00:59:07.328
Well. we need Kate...

1018
00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:10.706
and we need Leo. and
we need them now.

1019
00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:12.790
Come on.

1020
00:59:16.295 --> 00:59:18.422
'Hold on. Hold on.

1021
00:59:18.506 --> 00:59:20.758
'Keep your eyes closed.

1022
00:59:20.841 --> 00:59:25.304
'Do you trust me? '
- 'I trust you. '

1023
00:59:26.263 --> 00:59:28.849
Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

1024
00:59:28.933 --> 00:59:31.519
Fool.
- Get off. you big bully.

1025
00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:37.190
'All right. open your eyes. '

1026
00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.360
You know. Sammy.

1027
00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.930
I'm sure she's unique
and extraordinary...

1028
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.975
but general wisdom
is that in the end.

1029
00:59:47.075 --> 00:59:50.730
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

1030
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:53.648
There was for Kate and Leo.

1031
00:59:53.748 --> 00:59:56.418
There was for you.

1032
00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.459
And there is for me.

1033
00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.461
She's the one.

1034
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.951
Fair enough. And
her name's Joanna?

1035
01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:08.221
Yeah. I know.
Same as Mum.

1036
01:00:18.564 --> 01:00:21.025
Yeah.

1037
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.965
Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

1038
01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:45.866
Oh. Appolo...
Erm. appologia.

1039
01:00:45.966 --> 01:00:48.100
Grande. er... grande familio.

1040
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.163
grande tradizione de
Christmas presents.

1041
01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:53.306
Stupido.

1042
01:01:19.457 --> 01:01:22.126
Well. goodbye.

1043
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.295
Thank you.

1044
01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:29.842
Erm. it was. erm...

1045
01:01:30.969 --> 01:01:33.971
I
will miss you.

1046
01:01:35.305 --> 01:01:38.183
And your very slow typing...

1047
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:42.145
and your very bad driving.

1048
01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:47.001
You know I love
Christmas. I always will

1049
01:02:48.502 --> 01:02:53.048
My mind's made up.
the way that I feel

1050
01:02:54.507 --> 01:02:59.054
There's no beginning.
there'll be no end

1051
01:02:59.137 --> 01:03:04.142
Cos on Christmas
you can depend

1052
01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:12.400
Daniel.

1053
01:03:13.526 --> 01:03:17.572
I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

1054
01:03:17.656 --> 01:03:19.625
Well. girls love
musicians. don't they?

1055
01:03:19.725 --> 01:03:20.725
Uh-huh.

1056
01:03:20.825 --> 01:03:22.628
Even the weird ones
get girlfriends.

1057
01:03:22.728 --> 01:03:23.728
That's right.

1058
01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:26.231
Meat Loaf definitely
got laid at least once.

1059
01:03:26.331 --> 01:03:27.487
For God's sake.

1060
01:03:27.587 --> 01:03:30.110
Ringo Starr married
a Bond girl.

1061
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.126
Whatever. There's
this big concert...

1062
01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:34.196
at the end of term
and Joanna's in it.

1063
01:03:34.296 --> 01:03:36.599
I thought if I
was in the band...

1064
01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:38.075
and played superbly.

1065
01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:40.067
she might fall
in love with me.

1066
01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:41.245
What do you think?

1067
01:03:41.345 --> 01:03:44.165
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's stellar.

1068
01:03:44.265 --> 01:03:48.127
Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

1069
01:03:48.227 --> 01:03:50.952
I don't play a
musical instrument?

1070
01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:52.256
Yes. sir.

1071
01:03:52.356 --> 01:03:54.466
A tiny. insignificant detail.

1072
01:03:59.215 --> 01:04:00.139
You look into my eyes

1073
01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:02.908
I go out of my mind

1074
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:04.950
I can't see anything

1075
01:04:04.994 --> 01:04:07.538
Cos this love's got me blind

1076
01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:10.416
I can't help myself

1077
01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:12.150
I can't break this spell

1078
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.878
I can't even try

1079
01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:21.676
Baby. I'm too lost in you

1080
01:04:21.759 --> 01:04:23.928
Caught in you

1081
01:04:24.012 --> 01:04:27.473
Lost in everything
about you

1082
01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:32.020
So deep I can't
sleep. I can't...

1083
01:04:32.103 --> 01:04:34.797
I suppose I'd better
do the duty round.

1084
01:04:34.897 --> 01:04:36.941
You're a saint.

1085
01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:47.008
Any chance of a
dance with the boss?

1086
01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.912
Yeah. sure. sure.

1087
01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.310
As long as your
boyfriend doesn't mind.

1088
01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.127
Not my boyfriend.

1089
01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.338
And you're all I see

1090
01:04:59.421 --> 01:05:01.923
And you're all I need

1091
01:05:02.007 --> 01:05:04.217
Help me. baby
Help me. baby

1092
01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.661
Help me. baby

1093
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:11.099
Oh baby. I'm too lost in you

1094
01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.334
Caught in you...

1095
01:05:12.434 --> 01:05:15.409
You're looking very
pretty tonight.

1096
01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.857
It's for you.

1097
01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:22.361
Sorry?

1098
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.990
It's all for you. sir.

1099
01:05:28.909 --> 01:05:30.727
You do

1100
01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:33.955
I'm too lost in you
Baby. baby

1101
01:05:34.038 --> 01:05:38.209
Baby. I'm too lost in you
Yeah. yeah

1102
01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.711
Caught in you

1103
01:05:40.795 --> 01:05:43.965
Lost in everything
about you

1104
01:05:44.048 --> 01:05:48.135
So deep I can't sleep...

1105
01:05:49.303 --> 01:05:51.497
'This must be very
exciting for you.

1106
01:05:51.597 --> 01:05:53.916
fighting for the
Christmas number one.

1107
01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:57.086
'How's it looking so far? '
- 'Very bad indeed.

1108
01:05:57.186 --> 01:06:00.416
'Blue are outselling
me five to one...

1109
01:06:00.439 --> 01:06:03.484
'but I'm hoping
for a late surge.

1110
01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:06.570
'And. if I reach number one.

1111
01:06:06.654 --> 01:06:10.305
'I promise to sing a
song stark naked...

1112
01:06:10.405 --> 01:06:12.575
on TV on Christmas Eve. '

1113
01:06:13.743 --> 01:06:16.396
'Do you mean that? '
- 'Of course I do. Michael.

1114
01:06:16.496 --> 01:06:19.524
'Do you want a preview?
You old flirt. '

1115
01:06:23.086 --> 01:06:25.155
'That'll never
make number one. '

1116
01:06:28.341 --> 01:06:31.745
And I burn every track
Clipse and J Timberlake...

1117
01:06:31.845 --> 01:06:33.334
I suppose it's his job...

1118
01:06:33.434 --> 01:06:35.415
to dance with
everyone. isn't it?

1119
01:06:35.515 --> 01:06:37.684
Some more than others.

1120
01:06:40.937 --> 01:06:43.106
Just one dance?

1121
01:06:43.189 --> 01:06:45.551
Before we run
out of chances.

1122
01:06:45.651 --> 01:06:46.635
Who. me?

1123
01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:50.905
Unless you just...
- No. No. Good.

1124
01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:53.115
Yes. Thanks.

1125
01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:55.707
You're a good girl

1126
01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:58.646
And that's what makes
me trust you like I do

1127
01:06:58.746 --> 01:07:01.415
Late at night I talk to you

1128
01:07:01.457 --> 01:07:02.942
Hey

1129
01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:05.027
You will know the
difference when...

1130
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:17.473
Like a flower

1131
01:07:17.556 --> 01:07:21.602
Waiting to bloom

1132
01:07:23.771 --> 01:07:26.523
Like a light bulb

1133
01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:30.069
In a dark room

1134
01:07:32.195 --> 01:07:34.906
I'm just sitting here

1135
01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:37.700
Waiting for you

1136
01:07:37.784 --> 01:07:40.078
To come on home

1137
01:07:40.161 --> 01:07:42.205
And turn me on

1138
01:07:48.127 --> 01:07:51.005
Like the desert

1139
01:07:52.131 --> 01:07:56.886
Waiting for the rain

1140
01:07:58.012 --> 01:08:00.556
Like a schoolkid

1141
01:08:02.225 --> 01:08:04.978
Waiting for the spring

1142
01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:08.548
I'm just sitting here

1143
01:08:08.648 --> 01:08:13.652
Waiting for you
to come on home

1144
01:08:13.735 --> 01:08:16.947
And turn me on

1145
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:21.952
Turn me on

1146
01:08:22.035 --> 01:08:24.245
Well. then. I'd better go.

1147
01:08:24.288 --> 01:08:26.331
OK.

1148
01:08:27.708 --> 01:08:29.918
Good night.
- Good night.

1149
01:08:47.102 --> 01:08:49.146
Actually...

1150
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:51.507
I don't have to go.
- Right. Good.

1151
01:08:51.606 --> 01:08:53.901
I mean...
- No. that's good.

1152
01:08:54.734 --> 01:08:57.110
Just. erm. would
you excuse me...

1153
01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:58.262
for one second?

1154
01:08:58.362 --> 01:09:01.032
Sure.
- Just one second.

1155
01:09:08.456 --> 01:09:11.834
Erm. OK. that's done. Erm...

1156
01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:15.462
Why don't you
come upstairs...

1157
01:09:15.562 --> 01:09:16.948
in about ten seconds?

1158
01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:19.300
Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

1159
01:09:44.115 --> 01:09:48.370
For you

1160
01:09:49.621 --> 01:09:54.417
There'll be no crying

1161
01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:02.801
For you

1162
01:10:04.427 --> 01:10:09.182
The sun will be shining

1163
01:10:09.599 --> 01:10:14.812
Cos I feel that
when I'm with you

1164
01:10:15.938 --> 01:10:19.733
It's all right...

1165
01:10:19.817 --> 01:10:22.278
Just tug it.
- OK.

1166
01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:27.700
I know it's right

1167
01:10:27.783 --> 01:10:31.328
And the songbirds

1168
01:10:31.412 --> 01:10:40.337
Keep singing like
they know the score

1169
01:10:40.421 --> 01:10:43.657
And I love you. I love
you. I love you...

1170
01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:46.468
You're beautiful.

1171
01:10:46.552 --> 01:10:50.931
Like never before...

1172
01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:12.035
I- I'd better answer that.

1173
01:11:16.331 --> 01:11:19.500
Hello. Hi. Hello. darling.

1174
01:11:19.584 --> 01:11:22.644
No. no. I'm not
busy. No. fire away.

1175
01:11:23.671 --> 01:11:25.490
Right.

1176
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:29.577
Yes. I... I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible...

1177
01:11:29.677 --> 01:11:33.331
to get the Pope on the
phone tonight but...

1178
01:11:33.513 --> 01:11:37.162
Yes. Yes. I'm sure
he's very good...

1179
01:11:37.262 --> 01:11:39.262
at exorcism but...

1180
01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.025
Well. I'm sure...

1181
01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:46.723
Jon Bon Jovi is as well...

1182
01:11:46.823 --> 01:11:48.887
and I'll definitely
look into it.

1183
01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:52.532
OK? OK. I'll talk
to you later.

1184
01:11:52.616 --> 01:11:54.660
All right. bye-bye.

1185
01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:03.961
Sorry about that.
- No. it's fine.

1186
01:12:04.044 --> 01:12:08.039
It's my brother. he's
not well. he calls a lot.

1187
01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:11.451
I'm sorry.
- No. it's fine. It's fine.

1188
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.871
I mean. it's not really
fine. it is what it is.

1189
01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:17.050
and there being
no parents now...

1190
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:18.583
and us being over here.

1191
01:12:18.683 --> 01:12:21.001
it's my job to keep
an eye on him.

1192
01:12:21.101 --> 01:12:24.046
Not my job. obviously.
I'm glad to do it...

1193
01:12:24.146 --> 01:12:26.197
That's OK. Life is full...

1194
01:12:26.297 --> 01:12:29.272
of interruptions
and complications.

1195
01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:33.570
So...

1196
01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:52.132
Will it make him better?

1197
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.285
No.

1198
01:12:55.385 --> 01:12:57.429
Then maybe...

1199
01:12:58.221 --> 01:13:00.265
don't answer.

1200
01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:10.317
Hey. How you doing?

1201
01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:14.029
Right. right. Oh. no. please.

1202
01:13:14.112 --> 01:13:17.349
Oh. please. please
don't. little darling.

1203
01:13:17.449 --> 01:13:20.385
Between the two of us
we'll find the answer...

1204
01:13:20.485 --> 01:13:22.187
and it won't hurt any more.

1205
01:13:22.287 --> 01:13:24.287
No. no.

1206
01:13:24.331 --> 01:13:26.374
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

1207
01:13:28.043 --> 01:13:32.462
Of course. if you want me
to come over I will. Mm-hm.

1208
01:13:33.088 --> 01:13:35.088
OK.

1209
01:13:43.933 --> 01:13:46.769
That was a good night.

1210
01:13:46.852 --> 01:13:49.505
Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1211
01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:51.215
It's true.

1212
01:13:51.315 --> 01:13:53.746
Nowadays the only
clothes I can get into...

1213
01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.469
were once owned
by Pavarotti.

1214
01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:59.224
I always think Pavarotti
dresses very well.

1215
01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:04.078
Mia's very pretty.

1216
01:14:05.996 --> 01:14:08.040
Is she?

1217
01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:12.460
You know she is. darling.

1218
01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:14.712
Be careful there.

1219
01:14:37.986 --> 01:14:40.961
Have you been
watching stuff on TV?

1220
01:14:42.115 --> 01:14:44.659
Yeah.

1221
01:14:44.742 --> 01:14:46.742
Every night.
- Good.

1222
01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:48.913
And every day.

1223
01:14:55.877 --> 01:14:58.716
The nurses are
trying to kill me.

1224
01:14:58.816 --> 01:15:01.742
Nobody's trying to
kill you. babe.

1225
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:08.974
Thank you.

1226
01:15:11.727 --> 01:15:14.187
Don't do that. my darling.

1227
01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:18.567
Thank you.

1228
01:15:25.657 --> 01:15:27.784
Don't do that.

1229
01:16:00.483 --> 01:16:03.281
Right. Back at three.
Christmas shopping.

1230
01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:04.929
never easy or pleasant.

1231
01:16:05.029 --> 01:16:07.907
Are you gonna
get me something?

1232
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.034
Er...

1233
01:16:11.576 --> 01:16:13.603
I don't know. I
hadn't thought.

1234
01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.522
Where's Sarah. by the way?

1235
01:16:15.622 --> 01:16:18.358
She couldn't make it
in. Family thing.

1236
01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:20.365
There's a word
for hangover

1237
01:16:20.465 --> 01:16:22.154
I've never heard before.

1238
01:16:22.254 --> 01:16:26.383
See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

1239
01:16:29.803 --> 01:16:31.846
A lot.

1240
01:16:43.942 --> 01:16:46.662
Are you gonna give
me something?

1241
01:16:47.153 --> 01:16:49.848
I thought I made it
clear last night.

1242
01:16:49.948 --> 01:16:53.687
When it comes to me.
you can have everything.

1243
01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:57.204
So. erm. what do you need?

1244
01:16:58.497 --> 01:17:00.763
Something along the
stationery line?

1245
01:17:00.863 --> 01:17:02.485
Are you short of staplers?

1246
01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:06.005
No. I don't want
something I need.

1247
01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:09.658
I want something I
want. Something pretty.

1248
01:17:10.718 --> 01:17:12.718
Right.

1249
01:17:13.721 --> 01:17:15.764
Right.

1250
01:17:23.147 --> 01:17:25.902
Sorry I'm late.
I had to drop off

1251
01:17:26.002 --> 01:17:28.002
Bernie at rehearsal.

1252
01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.389
Right. listen. you keep
yourself occupied...

1253
01:17:33.489 --> 01:17:37.229
while I do the boring
stuff for our mothers.

1254
01:17:58.598 --> 01:18:00.725
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1255
01:18:00.808 --> 01:18:03.503
Looking for anything
in particular. sir?

1256
01:18:03.603 --> 01:18:07.231
Yes. That necklace
there. how much is it?

1257
01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:09.484
It's 270.

1258
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.947
Erm. all right. Er. I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1259
01:18:17.991 --> 01:18:21.078
Would you like i
t... giftwrapped?

1260
01:18:21.161 --> 01:18:23.914
Yes. all right.
- Lovely.

1261
01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:29.592
Let me just pop
it in the box.

1262
01:18:30.963 --> 01:18:32.364
There.

1263
01:18:32.464 --> 01:18:34.794
Look. could we
be quite quick?

1264
01:18:34.894 --> 01:18:36.034
Certainly. sir.

1265
01:18:36.134 --> 01:18:39.024
Ready in the
flashiest of flashes.

1266
01:18:46.478 --> 01:18:48.088
There.
- That's great.

1267
01:18:48.188 --> 01:18:50.983
Not quite finished.

1268
01:18:54.527 --> 01:18:57.427
I don't need a bag. I'll
put it in my pocket.

1269
01:18:57.527 --> 01:18:59.182
Oh. this isn't a bag. sir.

1270
01:18:59.282 --> 01:19:00.282
Really?

1271
01:19:00.382 --> 01:19:03.102
This is so much
more than a bag.

1272
01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:11.460
Ooh.

1273
01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:28.252
Could we be quite
quick. please?

1274
01:19:28.352 --> 01:19:31.105
Prontissimo.

1275
01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:52.108
What's that?
- A cinnamon stick. sir.

1276
01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:55.695
Actually. I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it. sir.

1277
01:19:55.795 --> 01:19:58.048
Want to bet?

1278
01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:00.681
'Tis but the work
of a moment.

1279
01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.289
There we go.
Almost finished.

1280
01:20:06.389 --> 01:20:08.527
Are you gonna
dip it in yogurt?

1281
01:20:08.627 --> 01:20:10.836
Cover it with
chocolate buttons?

1282
01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:12.761
No. sir. we're
going to pop it...

1283
01:20:12.861 --> 01:20:14.004
in the Christmas box.

1284
01:20:14.104 --> 01:20:15.673
I don't want a
Christmas box.

1285
01:20:15.773 --> 01:20:17.677
But you wanted
it giftwrapped.

1286
01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:18.509
I did but...

1287
01:20:18.609 --> 01:20:20.344
The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1288
01:20:20.444 --> 01:20:23.155
All we need now...
- Oh. God.

1289
01:20:23.239 --> 01:20:25.391
...is a sprig of holly.
- No. no. no. no.

1290
01:20:25.491 --> 01:20:27.476
No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1291
01:20:27.576 --> 01:20:30.246
Leave it.
- Ooh.

1292
01:20:30.329 --> 01:20:32.509
Loitering around the
jewellery section?

1293
01:20:32.609 --> 01:20:34.275
No. I was just
looking around.

1294
01:20:34.375 --> 01:20:35.912
Don't worry. My
expectations...

1295
01:20:36.012 --> 01:20:36.986
are not that high...

1296
01:20:37.086 --> 01:20:38.286
after 13 years of

1297
01:20:38.386 --> 01:20:40.698
Mr Oh-But-You-Alw
ays-Love-Scarves.

1298
01:20:40.798 --> 01:20:42.825
Actually. I do love this one.

1299
01:20:45.177 --> 01:20:47.346
I've gotta know

1300
01:20:47.429 --> 01:20:53.559
Where do the lonely
hearts go...

1301
01:20:53.643 --> 01:20:56.980
Hey.
- What are you doing here?

1302
01:20:57.063 --> 01:21:00.049
Had to rent out my flat
to pay for my ticket.

1303
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:02.115
You're not actually
going ahead...

1304
01:21:02.215 --> 01:21:03.469
with this stupid plan?

1305
01:21:03.569 --> 01:21:05.263
I bloody am.

1306
01:21:05.363 --> 01:21:07.542
You think this is
full of clothes?

1307
01:21:07.642 --> 01:21:08.641
Like hell it is.

1308
01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:11.801
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

1309
01:21:11.869 --> 01:21:15.273
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect. keep that going.

1310
01:21:15.373 --> 01:21:17.753
Look. erm...

1311
01:21:19.002 --> 01:21:21.529
sorry to be a bit forward
and all that but...

1312
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:24.250
you don't fancy going
for a Christmas drink.

1313
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:26.242
do you? I mean.
nothing implied.

1314
01:21:26.342 --> 01:21:29.386
Just maybe go
and see something

1315
01:21:29.486 --> 01:21:31.930
Christmassy or something.

1316
01:21:32.014 --> 01:21:33.871
Obviously. if you
don't want to.

1317
01:21:33.971 --> 01:21:35.292
you don't have to. I...

1318
01:21:35.392 --> 01:21:37.085
I'm rambling now. sorry.

1319
01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:39.855
No. That would be lovely.

1320
01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.274
Oh. great.

1321
01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:45.928
Yay.

1322
01:21:46.028 --> 01:21:48.138
You know. that
is really great.

1323
01:21:48.238 --> 01:21:50.829
Normally. I'm really
shy. takes me ages...

1324
01:21:50.929 --> 01:21:53.143
to get the courage
up. so thank you.

1325
01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:02.533
Explain again why
you're so late.

1326
01:22:02.633 --> 01:22:05.098
Can't a man have
any secrets?

1327
01:22:05.172 --> 01:22:07.257
We've been
waiting for hours.

1328
01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:09.368
it's the first ever preview.

1329
01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:11.592
...is a thing of the past

1330
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.956
Maybe you can bring
us all hope this year

1331
01:22:15.056 --> 01:22:18.000
Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared...

1332
01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.129
It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem...

1333
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:25.399
and the baby Jesus
was in his manger.

1334
01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:37.203
Sherlock Holmes is
not a real detective.

1335
01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:40.273
Is this the
way to the train station?

1336
01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:43.501
I would like
half-pint of churly.

1337
01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.280
I would like a
one-day Travelcard.

1338
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.932
Oh. my God.

1339
01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:51.117
I've got a terrible
stomachache.

1340
01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:53.451
It must have
been the prawns.

1341
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:56.526
Milton Keynes has
many roundabouts.

1342
01:22:57.264 --> 01:23:01.434
My goodness.
this is a very big fish.

1343
01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.521
It tastes delicious.

1344
01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:06.256
All alone on Christmas

1345
01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.967
Nobody ought to be
alone on Christmas

1346
01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.473
All alone on Christmas

1347
01:23:10.573 --> 01:23:12.971
Nobody ought to be
alone on Christmas

1348
01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:14.556
Tell me I've got to know

1349
01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:17.477
Nobody ought to be
alone on Christmas

1350
01:23:17.577 --> 01:23:19.311
Don't leave me alone...

1351
01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.515
You'll come back
a broken man.

1352
01:23:21.615 --> 01:23:24.149
Yeah. back broken
from too much sex.

1353
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.568
You are on the
road to disaster.

1354
01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:30.130
No. I am on shag
highway. heading west.

1355
01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:32.754
Farewell. failure.

1356
01:23:32.798 --> 01:23:36.719
America. watch out.
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1357
01:23:36.802 --> 01:23:40.347
And he's got a big knob...

1358
01:23:41.473 --> 01:23:43.858
(Santana Featuring
Rob Thomas:

1359
01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:45.958
Smooth)...

1360
01:23:51.108 --> 01:23:53.636
Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1361
01:23:53.736 --> 01:23:54.791
Just any bar.

1362
01:23:54.891 --> 01:23:57.526
Just your average
American bar.

1363
01:23:57.907 --> 01:24:00.784
(On jukebo Man.
it's a hot one

1364
01:24:00.868 --> 01:24:04.183
Like seven inches
from the midday sun...

1365
01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:05.340
Can I help you?

1366
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.983
Yes. I'd like a
Budweiser. please.

1367
01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:11.461
King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1368
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.672
Oh. my God.

1369
01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:16.756
Are you from England?

1370
01:24:18.301 --> 01:24:20.720
Yes.
- Oh...

1371
01:24:20.803 --> 01:24:23.765
that is so cute.

1372
01:24:23.848 --> 01:24:27.518
Hi. I'm Stacey.

1373
01:24:27.602 --> 01:24:29.646
Jeannie?

1374
01:24:31.564 --> 01:24:33.650
Yeah?

1375
01:24:33.733 --> 01:24:36.486
This is...
- Colin.

1376
01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:40.240
Frissell.

1377
01:24:40.323 --> 01:24:42.408
Cute name.

1378
01:24:42.492 --> 01:24:45.286
Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1379
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.580
Yep. Basildon.

1380
01:24:47.664 --> 01:24:50.541
Oh.
- Oh.

1381
01:24:50.625 --> 01:24:53.027
Wait till Carol-Anne
gets here.

1382
01:24:53.127 --> 01:24:55.529
She's crazy about
English guys.

1383
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:57.756
Uh-huh.

1384
01:25:00.842 --> 01:25:01.910
Hey. girls.

1385
01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.805
Carol-Anne. come
meet Colin.

1386
01:25:04.888 --> 01:25:07.474
He's from England.

1387
01:25:07.557 --> 01:25:11.770
Well. step aside.
ladies. This one's on me.

1388
01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.490
Hey. gorgeous.

1389
01:25:19.278 --> 01:25:21.363
That is so funny.

1390
01:25:22.739 --> 01:25:25.058
What do you call that?
- Er. bottle.

1391
01:25:25.158 --> 01:25:27.227
'Bottle. '

1392
01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:29.354
What about this?
- Er. straw.

1393
01:25:29.454 --> 01:25:31.273
'Straw. '

1394
01:25:31.372 --> 01:25:33.412
What about this?
- Table.

1395
01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.652
Table. The same.
- Oh. it's the same.

1396
01:25:36.752 --> 01:25:40.114
Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1397
01:25:40.214 --> 01:25:42.992
I'll just check into a
motel like in the movies.

1398
01:25:43.092 --> 01:25:46.370
Oh. my God. Oh. my
God. that is so cute.

1399
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:49.421
No. no. no. listen. This
may be a bit pushy...

1400
01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:51.167
cos we just met you but...

1401
01:25:51.267 --> 01:25:53.753
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1402
01:25:53.853 --> 01:25:55.980
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1403
01:25:56.063 --> 01:25:59.008
Well. if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1404
01:25:59.108 --> 01:26:02.111
Hell no.
- But there's one problem.

1405
01:26:02.194 --> 01:26:04.280
What?

1406
01:26:04.363 --> 01:26:06.875
Well. we're not the
richest of girls.

1407
01:26:06.975 --> 01:26:07.975
you know.

1408
01:26:08.075 --> 01:26:13.038
So we just have a little
bed and no couch.

1409
01:26:13.121 --> 01:26:16.441
So you'd have to share
with all three of us.

1410
01:26:16.541 --> 01:26:20.397
And on this cold. cold
night it's gonna be...

1411
01:26:20.497 --> 01:26:22.964
crowded and
sweaty and stuff.

1412
01:26:23.048 --> 01:26:25.853
And we can't even
afford pyjamas.

1413
01:26:25.884 --> 01:26:28.261
No?

1414
01:26:28.345 --> 01:26:30.847
Which means...

1415
01:26:30.931 --> 01:26:33.099
we would be naked.

1416
01:26:37.812 --> 01:26:39.422
No. no. I think it'd be fine.

1417
01:26:39.522 --> 01:26:41.900
Great.
- Erm...

1418
01:26:41.983 --> 01:26:43.953
The thing that's
gonna make it...

1419
01:26:44.053 --> 01:26:45.053
more crowded...

1420
01:26:45.153 --> 01:26:47.305
Harriet. You
haven't met Harriet.

1421
01:26:47.405 --> 01:26:49.224
There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1422
01:26:49.324 --> 01:26:51.985
Don't worry. you're
totally gonna like her...

1423
01:26:52.085 --> 01:26:53.602
cos she is 'the sexy one'.

1424
01:26:53.702 --> 01:26:56.455
Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1425
01:26:56.538 --> 01:27:00.376
Praise the Lord.
- Oh. and he's a Christian.

1426
01:27:02.878 --> 01:27:04.488
Cheers.

1427
01:27:04.588 --> 01:27:07.091
If I could

1428
01:27:07.174 --> 01:27:09.301
Then I would

1429
01:27:09.385 --> 01:27:13.555
I'll go wherever you will go

1430
01:27:13.639 --> 01:27:15.641
Way up high

1431
01:27:15.724 --> 01:27:17.768
Or down low

1432
01:27:17.851 --> 01:27:22.022
I'll go wherever you will go

1433
01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:25.484
If I could turn back...

1434
01:27:25.568 --> 01:27:27.361
One present only
each tonight.

1435
01:27:27.461 --> 01:27:28.762
Who's got one for Dad?

1436
01:27:28.862 --> 01:27:30.806
I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1437
01:27:30.906 --> 01:27:31.905
I'll get it.

1438
01:27:32.005 --> 01:27:34.017
No. no. no. I want
to choose mine.

1439
01:27:34.117 --> 01:27:36.369
I think I want...

1440
01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.580
...this one.

1441
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.317
I have bought the
traditional scarf as well...

1442
01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:43.944
but this is my other.

1443
01:27:44.044 --> 01:27:46.321
slightly special.
personal one.

1444
01:27:46.421 --> 01:27:48.548
Thank you.

1445
01:27:48.631 --> 01:27:50.717
That's a real first.

1446
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.219
Rip it.
- What is it?

1447
01:27:53.303 --> 01:27:56.618
I'm going to... All
right. I'll rip it.

1448
01:28:02.437 --> 01:28:04.814
God. that's a surprise.

1449
01:28:06.107 --> 01:28:08.107
What is it?

1450
01:28:09.777 --> 01:28:13.447
It's a CD. Joni
Mitchell. wow.

1451
01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:15.849
To continue your
emotional education.

1452
01:28:15.949 --> 01:28:18.118
Yes.

1453
01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:20.662
Goodness.

1454
01:28:20.746 --> 01:28:22.746
That's great.

1455
01:28:22.789 --> 01:28:25.709
My brilliant wife.
- Ah. yes.

1456
01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:31.182
Actually. do you mind if
I just absent myself...

1457
01:28:31.282 --> 01:28:32.282
for a second?

1458
01:28:32.382 --> 01:28:35.260
All that ice cream. Er...

1459
01:28:35.344 --> 01:28:37.085
Darling. could
you make sure...

1460
01:28:37.185 --> 01:28:38.580
the kids are ready to go?

1461
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680
Back in a minute.

1462
01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.084
All
right. take it easy.

1463
01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:44.394
Mine first. Mine.

1464
01:28:44.561 --> 01:28:46.335
(Joni Mitchell:
Both Sides No

1465
01:28:46.435 --> 01:28:47.297
Moons and Junes

1466
01:28:47.397 --> 01:28:49.775
And Ferris wheels

1467
01:28:51.276 --> 01:28:56.489
The dizzy dancing
way that you feel

1468
01:28:56.572 --> 01:29:01.619
As every fairy
tale comes real

1469
01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:06.499
I've looked at love that way

1470
01:29:10.169 --> 01:29:13.798
But now it's just
another show

1471
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:20.596
And you leave 'em
laughing when you go

1472
01:29:22.014 --> 01:29:24.725
And if you care

1473
01:29:24.809 --> 01:29:26.978
Don't let them know

1474
01:29:28.813 --> 01:29:32.023
Don't give yourself away

1475
01:29:34.859 --> 01:29:37.153
I've looked at love

1476
01:29:37.237 --> 01:29:40.115
From both sides now

1477
01:29:40.198 --> 01:29:42.284
From give and take

1478
01:29:43.535 --> 01:29:46.705
And still somehow

1479
01:29:46.788 --> 01:29:52.002
It's love's illusions
that I recall

1480
01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.339
I really don't know love

1481
01:30:00.677 --> 01:30:03.388
I really don't
know love at all

1482
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:17.401
Tears and fears

1483
01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:20.279
And feeling proud

1484
01:30:21.405 --> 01:30:26.452
To say I love you
right out loud

1485
01:30:27.578 --> 01:30:30.247
Dreams and schemes

1486
01:30:30.331 --> 01:30:33.125
And circus crowds

1487
01:30:34.501 --> 01:30:37.546
I've looked at life that way

1488
01:30:39.048 --> 01:30:41.216
Oh but now old friends...

1489
01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.910
Oh. my God.

1490
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:46.055
It's a miracle.
You're all dressed.

1491
01:30:46.138 --> 01:30:47.799
Come on. come
on. come on.

1492
01:30:47.899 --> 01:30:49.166
we're horribly late.

1493
01:30:49.266 --> 01:30:52.495
Come on. then. In
the car. In the car.

1494
01:30:52.936 --> 01:30:55.730
Well something's lost

1495
01:30:55.813 --> 01:30:57.813
But something's gained

1496
01:30:59.108 --> 01:31:02.403
In living every day...

1497
01:31:02.695 --> 01:31:05.740
Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

1498
01:31:05.823 --> 01:31:08.080
But the thing about
romance is people...

1499
01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:10.436
only get together
right at the very end.

1500
01:31:10.536 --> 01:31:12.705
Of course.

1501
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:16.074
By the way. I feel bad.
I never ask you...

1502
01:31:16.174 --> 01:31:17.652
how your love life is going.

1503
01:31:17.752 --> 01:31:19.752
Er-huh.

1504
01:31:19.796 --> 01:31:21.573
No.

1505
01:31:21.673 --> 01:31:22.673
As you know.

1506
01:31:22.773 --> 01:31:25.323
that was a done
deal long ago.

1507
01:31:25.927 --> 01:31:28.598
Unless Claudia Schiffer
calls. in which case

1508
01:31:28.698 --> 01:31:30.874
I want you out of
here straightaway.

1509
01:31:30.974 --> 01:31:33.084
you wee motherless
mongrel.

1510
01:31:33.184 --> 01:31:34.168
Oh.

1511
01:31:34.268 --> 01:31:36.553
No. no. We'll want
to have sex...

1512
01:31:36.653 --> 01:31:38.797
in every room.
including yours.

1513

'It's a rainy Christmas
Eve all over the UK...

- Hello.

'How will you be
celebrating? '

1525
01:32:09.143 --> 01:32:09.870
I don't know.

1526
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:11.630
Er. either I could
behave like...

1527
01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:13.080
a real rock'n'roll loser...

1528
01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.917

my fat manager...

01:32:18.185 --> 01:32:20.364
I'll be flooded by invitations...

glamorous parties.

Oh. Jesus. not
that crap again.

01:32:31.157 --> 01:32:33.826
I feel it in my fingers...

1537
01:32:33.868 --> 01:32:36.329
Bill. it's for you. babe.

1538
01:32:37.371 --> 01:32:39.832
Hello. Elton.

1539
01:32:39.916 --> 01:32:43.377
O- Of course. Of course.

1540
01:32:43.461 --> 01:32:45.586
Send an embarrassingly
big car...

1541
01:32:45.686 --> 01:32:46.823
and I'll be there.

1542
01:32:48.674 --> 01:32:52.344
It's gonna be a very
good Christmas.

1543
01:33:00.352 --> 01:33:01.352
Right.

1544
01:33:01.452 --> 01:33:03.088
I'd better be getting
inside. actually.

1545
01:33:03.188 --> 01:33:04.589
My mum and... you know.

1546
01:33:04.689 --> 01:33:07.342
Of course. yeah. It's
getting a bit cold.

1547
01:33:07.442 --> 01:33:09.903
Erm...

1548
01:33:09.986 --> 01:33:12.781
Well. good night.
- Night.

1549
01:33:15.408 --> 01:33:17.408
Er...

1550
01:33:22.707 --> 01:33:25.752
Er... OK.

1551
01:33:38.514 --> 01:33:41.183
All I want for Christmas...

1552
01:33:41.267 --> 01:33:44.728
is you.

1553
01:33:44.812 --> 01:33:47.398
Right.

1554
01:33:47.481 --> 01:33:50.484
Thank you. Good.

1555
01:33:50.568 --> 01:33:52.568
Good night.

1556
01:33:53.571 --> 01:33:56.865
Ha ha ha. Ho.

1557
01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:01.750
I'm. I'm dreaming

1558
01:34:02.496 --> 01:34:06.083
Dreaming of a white...

1559
01:34:06.166 --> 01:34:08.736
Oh. look. everyone.
it's Uncle Jamie.

1560
01:34:08.836 --> 01:34:11.671
Hi. Uncle Jamie.

1561
01:34:11.754 --> 01:34:16.009
Yes. oh. splendid. It's
lovely to see you all.

1562
01:34:16.092 --> 01:34:18.553
And. er...

1563
01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:20.997
I'm off. actually.

1564
01:34:21.097 --> 01:34:23.975
But Jamie. darling.

1565
01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:26.603
Sorry.

1566
01:34:26.686 --> 01:34:29.831
Man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

1567
01:34:32.442 --> 01:34:34.442
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1568
01:34:34.444 --> 01:34:37.680
I hate Uncle Jamie.
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1569
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.908
And try to listen

1570
01:34:41.659 --> 01:34:44.704
To hear

1571
01:34:44.787 --> 01:34:47.081
Hear for the sleigh bells

1572
01:34:47.165 --> 01:34:49.192
That are ringing
in the snow...

1573
01:34:49.292 --> 01:34:52.776
Gatwick airport.
please. Fast as you can.

1574
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:59.051
I- I-I

1575
01:35:00.135 --> 01:35:02.179
I'm dreaming

1576
01:35:04.223 --> 01:35:06.934
Of a white...

1577
01:35:07.017 --> 01:35:09.770
Night. Sarah.
- Night. Karl.

Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

I want you to
know. may your day

1581
01:35:27.913 --> 01:35:31.083
May your day

1582
01:35:31.166 --> 01:35:35.503
Be so merry. merry
and bright...

1583
01:35:40.132 --> 01:35:43.135
Hi. babe. how's
it going? Yeah.

1584
01:35:43.219 --> 01:35:45.830
Is it all party. party.
party down there?

1585
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:48.015
All of your Christmases

1586
01:35:49.141 --> 01:35:51.686
And may all

1587
01:35:51.769 --> 01:35:55.106
And may all of
your Christmases

1588
01:35:56.649 --> 01:35:58.468
Baby may your days

1589
01:35:58.568 --> 01:36:02.280
May your days be merry

1590
01:36:02.363 --> 01:36:04.574
Merry. so merry...

1591
01:36:04.657 --> 01:36:07.768
Sam. time for dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

1592
01:36:07.868 --> 01:36:11.329
Sam. I've done
chicken kebabs.

1593
01:36:11.413 --> 01:36:13.565
Look at the
sign on the door.

1594
01:36:17.752 --> 01:36:19.796
Right.

1595
01:36:25.594 --> 01:36:28.305
It's a little long.

1596
01:36:28.388 --> 01:36:29.456
Dreaming.

1597
01:36:29.556 --> 01:36:34.352
dreaming of a white.
white Christmas...

1598
01:36:36.479 --> 01:36:38.523
I'll get it.

1599
01:36:44.738 --> 01:36:47.699
Oh. hi.
- Who is it?

1600
01:36:52.244 --> 01:36:54.104
It's carol singers.

1601
01:36:54.204 --> 01:36:56.273
Give them a quid and
tell them to bugger off.

1602
01:37:00.002 --> 01:37:04.882
Silent night

1603
01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:09.345
Holy night

1604
01:37:09.428 --> 01:37:13.849
All is calm

1605
01:37:13.933 --> 01:37:18.354
All is bright

1606
01:37:18.437 --> 01:37:22.983
Round yon virgin

1607
01:37:23.067 --> 01:37:27.404
Mother and child

1608
01:37:27.488 --> 01:37:31.532
Holy infant

1609
01:37:31.616 --> 01:37:36.204
So tender and mild

1610
01:37:36.287 --> 01:37:44.379
Sleep in heavenly peace

1611
01:37:45.713 --> 01:37:51.052
Sleep in heavenly peace

1612
01:37:54.806 --> 01:37:58.893
Silent night

1613
01:37:58.977 --> 01:38:03.439
Holy night

1614
01:38:03.523 --> 01:38:07.777
Shepherds quake

1615
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.860
At the sight...

1616
01:38:09.904 --> 01:38:11.972
Merry Christmas.

1617
01:38:12.072 --> 01:38:16.326
Glories stream

1618
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:20.747
From heaven afar

1619
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:30.340
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia

1620
01:38:30.424 --> 01:38:38.515
Christ the saviour is born

1621
01:38:39.641 --> 01:38:45.147
Christ the saviour is born

1622
01:38:48.191 --> 01:38:50.903
Enough.

1623
01:38:50.986 --> 01:38:52.845
Enough now.

1624
01:39:00.328 --> 01:39:02.422
What the hell are
you doing here?

1625
01:39:02.522 --> 01:39:04.941
You're supposed to
be at Elton John's.

1626
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.069
Well. I was there for
a minute or two...

1627
01:39:08.169 --> 01:39:10.196
and then I had an epiphany.

1628
01:39:10.296 --> 01:39:12.673
Really?
- Yeah.

1629
01:39:12.757 --> 01:39:14.842
Come on. Just come up.

1630
01:39:14.926 --> 01:39:18.054
So what was
this epiphany?

1631
01:39:18.137 --> 01:39:20.942
Erm. it... it was
about Christmas.

1632
01:39:20.973 --> 01:39:23.209
You realised it
was all around.

1633
01:39:23.309 --> 01:39:26.430
No. I realised that
Christmas is the time...

1634
01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:28.714
to be with the
people you love.

1635
01:39:28.814 --> 01:39:30.299
Right.

1636
01:39:30.399 --> 01:39:33.987
And I realised that.
as dire chance...

1637
01:39:34.087 --> 01:39:37.197
and fateful cockup
would have it.

1638
01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.282
here I am.

1639
01:39:39.366 --> 01:39:41.660
mid-fifties.

1640
01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:42.943
and without knowing it.

1641
01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.896
I've spent most of
my adult life...

1642
01:39:44.996 --> 01:39:48.792
with a chubby
employee.

1643
01:39:48.875 --> 01:39:51.570
And. much as it
grieves me to say it.

1644
01:39:51.670 --> 01:39:57.425
it might be that the people
I love is. in fact...

1645
01:39:58.552 --> 01:40:01.429
you.

1646
01:40:02.556 --> 01:40:04.681
Well. this is a surprise.

1647
01:40:04.724 --> 01:40:06.501
Yeah.

1648
01:40:06.601 --> 01:40:08.837
Ten minutes at Elton
John's and you're gay?

1649
01:40:08.937 --> 01:40:10.964
No. look. I'm serious here.

1650
01:40:11.064 --> 01:40:13.569
I left Elton's and
a hefty number...

1651
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:16.886
of half-naked chicks with
their mouths open...

1652
01:40:16.986 --> 01:40:21.282
in order to hang out
with you at Christmas.

1653
01:40:22.866 --> 01:40:24.075
Well. Bill...

1654
01:40:24.175 --> 01:40:28.289
It's a terrible. terrible
mistake. chubs...

1655
01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:36.376
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1656
01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:40.361
And to be honest.

1657
01:40:40.461 --> 01:40:42.926
despite all my
complaining...

1658
01:40:44.763 --> 01:40:47.228
we have had a
wonderful life.

1659
01:40:51.728 --> 01:40:53.728
Well...

1660
01:40:55.231 --> 01:40:57.400
thank you.

1661
01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:02.255
I mean. come on.
it's been an honour.

1662
01:41:03.656 --> 01:41:06.034
I feel very proud.

1663
01:41:06.117 --> 01:41:08.412
Oh. look. don't be a moron.

1664
01:41:19.172 --> 01:41:22.657
Come on. let's get
pissed and watch porn.

1665
01:41:42.069 --> 01:41:44.555
'Dear
sir. Dear David.

1666
01:41:44.655 --> 01:41:46.781
'Merry Christmas and
I hope you have...

1667
01:41:46.881 --> 01:41:48.058
a very happy New Year.

1668
01:41:48.158 --> 01:41:49.040
'I'm very sorry...

1669
01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.644
about the thing
that happened.

1670
01:41:50.744 --> 01:41:53.814
'It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.

1671
01:41:53.914 --> 01:41:55.774
'Particularly because...

1672
01:41:55.874 --> 01:41:57.485
'if you can't say
it at Christmas.

1673
01:41:57.585 --> 01:41:58.610
when can you. eh?...

1674
01:41:58.710 --> 01:42:02.620
'I'm actually yours. With
love. your Natalie. '

1675
01:42:22.441 --> 01:42:24.610
Jack. yeah. I need a car.

1676
01:42:24.694 --> 01:42:26.737
Right now. Thank you.

1677
01:42:38.374 --> 01:42:40.710
Oh. don't wait up.

1678
01:42:44.463 --> 01:42:45.330
I'd like to go to

1679
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:46.783
Wandsworth.
the dodgy end.

1680
01:42:46.883 --> 01:42:49.093
Very good. sir.

1681
01:42:49.176 --> 01:42:52.804
Tell me how you want me

1682
01:42:52.888 --> 01:42:56.558
I can feel it in
your heart beat

1683
01:42:56.641 --> 01:42:59.603
I know you like
what you see...

1684
01:42:59.686 --> 01:43:02.589
Harris Street.
What number. sir?

1685
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:05.071
Oh. God. it's
the longest street...

1686
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:07.552
in the world and I have
absolutely no idea.

1687
01:43:07.652 --> 01:43:10.572
Wrap your love around me

1688
01:43:10.655 --> 01:43:11.627
You're so excited

1689
01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:13.600
I can feel you
getting hotter...

1690
01:43:15.744 --> 01:43:17.604
Hello. does
Natalie live here?

1691
01:43:17.704 --> 01:43:18.704
No.

1692
01:43:18.804 --> 01:43:21.149
Right. fine. thank
you. Sorry to disturb.

1693
01:43:21.249 --> 01:43:23.376
Here. aren't...

1694
01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:26.796
Aren't you the
Prime Minister?

1695
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.451
Er. yes. In fact. I
am. Merry Christmas.

1696
01:43:30.551 --> 01:43:31.534
Oh.

1697
01:43:31.634 --> 01:43:34.010
Part of the service now.
Trying to get round...

1698
01:43:34.110 --> 01:43:35.454
everyone by
New Year's Eve.

1699
01:43:39.725 --> 01:43:43.020
Ah. Hello. Does
Natalie live here?

1700
01:43:43.103 --> 01:43:45.773
No. she doesn't.
- Oh dear. OK.

1701
01:43:45.814 --> 01:43:49.051
Are you singing carols?
- Er. no. No. I'm not.

1702
01:43:49.151 --> 01:43:52.363
Please. sir. please.
- Please.

1703
01:43:55.241 --> 01:43:57.059
Well. I suppose I could.

1704
01:43:57.159 --> 01:43:59.159
Please.

1705
01:44:00.371 --> 01:44:02.581
All right.

1706
01:44:04.917 --> 01:44:07.878
Good King Wenceslas
looked out

1707
01:44:07.962 --> 01:44:11.714
On the feast of Stephen...

1708
01:44:13.655 --> 01:44:15.243
When the snow
lay round about

1709
01:44:15.343 --> 01:44:18.763
Deep and crisp and even

1710
01:44:18.846 --> 01:44:22.350
Brightly shone the
moon that night...

1711
01:44:22.433 --> 01:44:24.961
Hello. Sorry to disturb.

1712
01:44:25.061 --> 01:44:28.022
Does Natalie live here?
- No.

1713
01:44:28.106 --> 01:44:30.233
She lives next door.

1714
01:44:32.735 --> 01:44:35.321
Ah. Brilliant.

1715
01:44:35.405 --> 01:44:38.349
You're not who I think
you are. are you?

1716
01:44:38.449 --> 01:44:40.518
Yes and I'm sorry
about all the cockups.

1717
01:44:40.618 --> 01:44:42.213
My cabinet are
absolute crap.

1718
01:44:42.313 --> 01:44:44.022
We hope to do
better next year.

1719
01:44:44.122 --> 01:44:46.332
Merry Christmas to you.

1720
01:45:01.138 --> 01:45:04.933
Ah. Hello.

1721
01:45:05.017 --> 01:45:07.269
Is. er. Natalie in?

1722
01:45:07.352 --> 01:45:10.582
Oh. where the fuck
is my fucking coat?

1723
01:45:11.607 --> 01:45:15.485
Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1724
01:45:15.569 --> 01:45:17.844
Erm. this is my
mum and my dad...

1725
01:45:17.944 --> 01:45:20.641
and my Uncle Tony
and my Auntie Glynne.

1726
01:45:20.741 --> 01:45:22.643
Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1727
01:45:22.743 --> 01:45:26.538
And. erm... this is
the Prime Minister.

1728
01:45:26.622 --> 01:45:29.499
Yes. we can see
that. darling.

1729
01:45:29.583 --> 01:45:32.360
And erm. unfortunately.
we're very late.

1730
01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:34.430
It's the school
Christmas concert.

1731
01:45:34.530 --> 01:45:35.530
you see. David.

1732
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:37.979
All the local schools
have joined together.

1733
01:45:38.079 --> 01:45:39.033
even St Basil's...

1734
01:45:39.133 --> 01:45:40.688
Too much detail. Mum.

1735
01:45:40.788 --> 01:45:42.954
Anyway. how can
we help. sir?

1736
01:45:43.054 --> 01:45:46.933
Well. I... just
needed Natalie...

1737
01:45:49.727 --> 01:45:51.771
on some state business.

1738
01:45:51.854 --> 01:45:56.442
Oh.
- Right. yes. Of course.

1739
01:45:56.525 --> 01:45:58.261
Right. er...

1740
01:45:58.361 --> 01:46:01.055
Well. perhaps you should
come on later. Plumpy.

1741
01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:02.515
Er. Natalie.

1742
01:46:02.615 --> 01:46:05.101
I don't want to make you
late for the concert.

1743
01:46:05.201 --> 01:46:06.793
No. it's nothing. really.

1744
01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.813
Keith'll be very
disappointed.

1745
01:46:08.913 --> 01:46:10.677
No. really. it doesn't matter.

1746
01:46:10.777 --> 01:46:13.024
The octopus costume's
taken me months.

1747
01:46:13.124 --> 01:46:15.110
Eight is a lot of legs. David.

1748
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:17.712
Mm. Erm...

1749
01:46:19.548 --> 01:46:21.616
Listen. why don't I
give you a lift...

1750
01:46:21.716 --> 01:46:24.024
and then we can talk about...

1751
01:46:24.124 --> 01:46:27.524
this state business
business in the car.

1752
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:29.875
OK.

1753
01:46:29.975 --> 01:46:32.811
Lovely. yes.
- Thank you.

1754
01:46:32.894 --> 01:46:34.980
Hold tight. everybody.

1755
01:46:41.611 --> 01:46:44.389
How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1756
01:46:44.489 --> 01:46:47.158
Ah. right. Well. er...

1757
01:46:49.119 --> 01:46:51.328
I just wanted to say...

1758
01:46:53.289 --> 01:46:55.399
thank you for the
Christmas card.

1759
01:46:55.499 --> 01:46:57.276
You're welcome.

1760
01:46:57.376 --> 01:46:59.278
Look. I'm so sorry
about that day.

1761
01:46:59.378 --> 01:47:01.370
I came in and he
slinked towards me...

1762
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:02.656
and there was a fire...

1763
01:47:02.756 --> 01:47:05.329
and he's the President
of the United States...

1764
01:47:05.429 --> 01:47:07.203
and nothing
happened. I promise.

1765
01:47:07.303 --> 01:47:10.414
I just felt like such
a fool because...

1766
01:47:10.514 --> 01:47:13.751
I think about you all
the time. actually.

1767
01:47:13.851 --> 01:47:16.113
And I think you're the
man that I really...

1768
01:47:16.213 --> 01:47:17.213
We're here.

1769
01:47:17.313 --> 01:47:18.923
...love.
- Oh. wow.

1770
01:47:19.023 --> 01:47:22.763
That really was just
round the corner. Er...

1771
01:47:23.402 --> 01:47:25.446
Erm...

1772
01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:30.159
Ow.

1773
01:47:36.706 --> 01:47:38.958
Well. look. I...

1774
01:47:40.752 --> 01:47:44.237
I think I'd better
not come in. you know?

1775
01:47:44.255 --> 01:47:46.091
Nobody wants some
politician...

1776
01:47:46.191 --> 01:47:47.784
stealing the kids' thunder.

1777
01:47:47.884 --> 01:47:51.471
No. please come.
It'll be great.

1778
01:47:51.554 --> 01:47:54.224
No. I'd... I'd better not.

1779
01:47:55.350 --> 01:48:00.146
But I will be very sorry...

1780
01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:02.315
to drive away from you.

1781
01:48:03.816 --> 01:48:05.985
Just give me one second.

1782
01:48:19.957 --> 01:48:21.615
John's been very
mysterious.

1783
01:48:21.715 --> 01:48:23.068
Where did you two meet?

1784
01:48:23.168 --> 01:48:26.255
Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1785
01:48:29.383 --> 01:48:31.426
No.

1786
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:06.419
Come on in. We can
watch from backstage.

1787
01:49:06.502 --> 01:49:08.797
OK. Terry. I won't be long.

1788
01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:15.036
Look. this has to be a
very secret visit. OK?

1789
01:49:15.136 --> 01:49:17.806
Don't worry. This
was my school.

1790
01:49:17.906 --> 01:49:20.456
I know my way
around. Come on.

1791
01:49:22.018 --> 01:49:23.951
Look. the sheep are
ready already...

1792
01:49:24.051 --> 01:49:25.213
and you're not even...

1793
01:49:25.313 --> 01:49:29.317
Oh. David.
- Ah.

1794
01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.693
Oh. how are you?

1795
01:49:31.776 --> 01:49:35.822
Hi. guys. Hey. hey.
hey. You all right?

1796
01:49:35.906 --> 01:49:38.016
What the hell are
you doing here?

1797
01:49:38.116 --> 01:49:39.102
Well. you know...

1798
01:49:39.202 --> 01:49:41.103
We always tell
your secretary...

1799
01:49:41.203 --> 01:49:43.725
that these things are
going on but it never...

1800
01:49:43.825 --> 01:49:45.899
occurred to me you'd
actually turn up.

1801
01:49:45.999 --> 01:49:47.859
I thought it was time I did.

1802
01:49:47.959 --> 01:49:49.590
I didn't want anyone to see.

1803
01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:51.321
so I'm gonna
hide somewhere.

1804
01:49:51.421 --> 01:49:53.824
Good luck. Daisy.
good luck. Bernie.

1805
01:49:53.924 --> 01:49:55.621
I've never been gladder...

1806
01:49:55.721 --> 01:49:57.619
to see my stupid
big brother.

1807
01:49:57.719 --> 01:50:00.972
Thank you.
- All right.

1808
01:50:01.056 --> 01:50:03.959
Oh. now. We haven't
been introduced.

1809
01:50:04.059 --> 01:50:07.103
Right. Well. this is Gavin.

1810
01:50:07.187 --> 01:50:09.397
Hello. Gavin.
- My copper.

1811
01:50:09.481 --> 01:50:11.507
And this is Natalie.
who's my. erm...

1812
01:50:11.607 --> 01:50:13.327
who's my. erm.
catering manager.

1813
01:50:13.427 --> 01:50:14.427
Oh.

1814
01:50:14.527 --> 01:50:16.570
Hi.
- Catering manager.

1815
01:50:16.654 --> 01:50:18.681
Watch he keeps
his hands off you.

1816
01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:20.933
20 years ago. you'd
have been his type.

1817
01:50:21.033 --> 01:50:24.057
I'll be very careful.
Don't try something. sir.

1818
01:50:24.157 --> 01:50:25.938
just because it's Christmas.

1819
01:50:26.038 --> 01:50:28.165
No. seriously.

1820
01:50:28.249 --> 01:50:30.584
Come on.
Showtime. Quickly.

1821
01:50:30.668 --> 01:50:33.279
Look. see you after. yeah?
- Probably.

1822
01:50:33.379 --> 01:50:36.282
Thank you. Prime Minister.
- It's all right.

1823
01:50:36.382 --> 01:50:38.551
Come on.
- Right.

1824
01:50:38.634 --> 01:50:41.871
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

1825
01:50:41.971 --> 01:50:46.559
Save it for a rainy day

1826
01:50:46.642 --> 01:50:50.688
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket

1827
01:50:50.771 --> 01:50:53.898
Never let it fade away

1828
01:50:55.024 --> 01:50:59.070
Never let it fade away

1829
01:50:59.737 --> 01:51:04.868
Never let it fade away...

1830
01:51:12.542 --> 01:51:14.818
Hillier School would
now like to present...

1831
01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:16.112
their Christmas number.

1832
01:51:16.212 --> 01:51:19.115
Lead vocals by ten-year-old
Joanna Anderson.

1833
01:51:19.215 --> 01:51:21.785
backing vocals
coordinated by her mother.

1834
01:51:21.885 --> 01:51:24.078
the great Mrs
Jean Anderson.

1835
01:51:24.178 --> 01:51:27.040
Erm. some of the staff
have decided to help out...

1836
01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:31.643
and for this. we ask
you to forgive us.

1837
01:51:31.727 --> 01:51:33.545
Thank you.

1838
01:51:39.318 --> 01:51:42.888
I don't want
a lot for Christmas

1839
01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:47.284
There's just
one thing I need

1840
01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:50.662
I don't care
about the presents

1841
01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:54.625
Underneath the
Christmas tree

1842
01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:58.337
I just want you for my own

1843
01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:02.216
More than you
could ever know

1844
01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:06.220
Make my wish come true

1845
01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:10.432
All I want for Christmas

1846
01:52:10.515 --> 01:52:18.189
Is you

1847
01:52:20.274 --> 01:52:22.844
I don't want a
lot for Christmas

1848
01:52:22.944 --> 01:52:26.239
There's just
one thing I need

1849
01:52:26.322 --> 01:52:29.283
I don't care
about the presents

1850
01:52:29.367 --> 01:52:32.537
Underneath the
Christmas tree

1851
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.915
I just want you for my own

1852
01:52:35.998 --> 01:52:38.918
More than you
could ever know

1853
01:52:39.001 --> 01:52:42.088
Make my wish come true

1854
01:52:42.171 --> 01:52:46.842
All I want for
Christmas is you

1855
01:52:48.511 --> 01:52:50.805
You baby

1856
01:52:50.888 --> 01:52:54.766
Oh. all the lights are shining

1857
01:52:54.849 --> 01:52:58.937
So brightly everywhere

1858
01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.658
And the sound of
children's laughter...

1859
01:53:01.758 --> 01:53:02.758
fills the air

1860
01:53:02.858 --> 01:53:05.235
Laughter fills the air

1861
01:53:05.318 --> 01:53:08.238
Everyone is singing
Oh yeah

1862
01:53:08.321 --> 01:53:10.682
I hear those sleigh
bells ringing

1863
01:53:10.782 --> 01:53:13.587
Santa won't you
bring me my honey

1864
01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:17.122
Won't you please
bring my baby to me

1865
01:53:17.205 --> 01:53:20.125
I don't want a
lot for Christmas

1866
01:53:20.208 --> 01:53:23.695
This is all I'm asking for
All I'm asking for

1867
01:53:23.795 --> 01:53:26.715
I just wanna see my baby

1868
01:53:26.798 --> 01:53:29.926
Standing right
outside my door

1869
01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:32.678
Cos I just want
you for my own

1870
01:53:32.761 --> 01:53:34.734
More than you
could ever know

1871
01:53:34.834 --> 01:53:36.040
You will ever know

1872
01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:39.476
Make my wish come true

1873
01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:43.689

1876
01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:53.324
And you and you

1877
01:53:53.407 --> 01:53:56.722
And you and you
All I want for Christmas

1878
01:53:57.203 --> 01:54:00.748
All I want for Christmas...

1879
01:54:17.013 --> 01:54:19.013
Right.

1880
01:54:21.976 --> 01:54:24.337
So. not quite as
secret as we'd hoped.

1881
01:54:24.437 --> 01:54:26.689
What do we do now?
- Smile.

1882
01:54:27.815 --> 01:54:29.859
Little bow.

1883
01:54:33.279 --> 01:54:35.406
And a wave.

1884
01:54:48.753 --> 01:54:51.947
Absolutely no idea.
I mean. can you imagine?

1885
01:54:52.047 --> 01:54:54.116
I'll see you later. all right?

1886
01:54:54.216 --> 01:54:56.343
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1887
01:54:58.804 --> 01:55:01.495
Tell me. if you were
in my position.

1888
01:55:01.595 --> 01:55:02.916
what would you do?

1889
01:55:03.016 --> 01:55:05.060
What position is that?

1890
01:55:05.143 --> 01:55:08.839
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace...

1891
01:55:08.939 --> 01:55:12.009
and. come Christmas.
gave it to somebody else.

1892
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:13.109
Oh. Karen...

1893
01:55:13.209 --> 01:55:14.845
Would you wait around
to find out...

1894
01:55:14.945 --> 01:55:15.563
Good night.

1895
01:55:15.663 --> 01:55:17.556
Night. darling.
Happy Christmas.

1896
01:55:17.656 --> 01:55:19.316
Would you wait around
to find out...

1897
01:55:19.416 --> 01:55:20.601
if it's just a necklace...

1898
01:55:20.701 --> 01:55:23.061
or if it's sex
and a necklace...

1899
01:55:23.161 --> 01:55:27.071
or if. worst of all. it's
a necklace and love?

1900
01:55:28.125 --> 01:55:30.477
Would you stay?
Knowing life...

1901
01:55:30.577 --> 01:55:33.237
would always be a
little bit worse?

1902
01:55:33.337 --> 01:55:36.799
Or would you cut and run?
- Oh. God.

1903
01:55:41.429 --> 01:55:44.223
I am so in the wrong.

1904
01:55:44.307 --> 01:55:46.350
A classic fool.

1905
01:55:46.434 --> 01:55:49.587
Yes. but you've also
made a fool out of me.

1906
01:55:49.687 --> 01:55:53.172
You've made the life
I lead foolish. too.

1907
01:55:54.942 --> 01:55:57.904
Darling. Ooh. darlings.

1908
01:55:57.987 --> 01:56:01.157
Oh. you were wonderful.

1909
01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.243
My little lobster.
you were so...

1910
01:56:04.327 --> 01:56:06.621
What is that word?

1911
01:56:06.704 --> 01:56:08.915
Orange.

1912
01:56:08.998 --> 01:56:11.752
Come on. I've got
treats at home.

1913
01:56:11.852 --> 01:56:13.443
Dad's coming.

1914
01:56:13.543 --> 01:56:18.256
Sammy. Fantastic show.
Classic drumming. son.

1915
01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:21.060
Thanks. Plan didn't
work. though.

1916
01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.369
Tell her. then.

1917
01:56:22.469 --> 01:56:24.329
Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1918
01:56:24.429 --> 01:56:27.349
No way. Anyway.
they fly tonight.

1919
01:56:27.432 --> 01:56:31.027
Even better. Sam. you've
got nothing to lose...

1920
01:56:31.127 --> 01:56:34.256
and you'll always
regret it if you don't.

1921
01:56:34.356 --> 01:56:36.550
I never told
your mum enough.

1922
01:56:36.650 --> 01:56:39.384
I should have told
her every day...

1923
01:56:39.484 --> 01:56:42.139
because she was
perfect every day.

1924
01:56:42.239 --> 01:56:44.654
You've seen the
films. kiddo.

1925
01:56:44.754 --> 01:56:47.219
It ain't over till it's over.

1926
01:56:48.495 --> 01:56:51.486
OK. Dad. Let's do it.
Let's go get the shit...

1927
01:56:51.586 --> 01:56:53.190
kicked out of us by love.

1928
01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:55.584
Yes.

1929
01:56:55.668 --> 01:56:58.048
Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1930
01:56:59.547 --> 01:57:02.383
Oh. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1931
01:57:02.466 --> 01:57:04.593
That's OK.

1932
01:57:04.677 --> 01:57:08.097
My fault.
- No. no. really. it wasn't.

1933
01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:11.058
You're Sam's
dad. aren't you?

1934
01:57:11.141 --> 01:57:14.019
Yeah. Stepdad. actually.

1935
01:57:14.103 --> 01:57:16.897
Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1936
01:57:16.981 --> 01:57:18.716
Carol.

1937
01:57:18.816 --> 01:57:23.195
OK. I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1938
01:57:24.613 --> 01:57:26.891
I hope we'll meet
again. Karen.

1939
01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:29.201
Carol...

1940
01:57:30.578 --> 01:57:35.164
I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1941
01:57:43.047 --> 01:57:45.091
Tell her.
- What?

1942
01:57:45.174 --> 01:57:48.177
You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1943
01:57:51.848 --> 01:57:53.917
Look. there she is.
- Where?

1944
01:57:54.017 --> 01:57:56.269
Over there.

1945
01:57:58.146 --> 01:58:00.148
Oh. no.

1946
01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:04.029
It's OK. we'll go
to the airport.

1947
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:06.129
I know a short cut.

1948
01:58:19.458 --> 01:58:21.527
Good evening.

1949
01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:24.630
Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1950
01:58:24.713 --> 01:58:28.383
I am here to ask
your daughter...

1951
01:58:28.467 --> 01:58:30.369
for her hands in marriage.

1952
01:58:30.469 --> 01:58:32.663
You want to marry
my daughter?

1953
01:58:32.763 --> 01:58:34.623
Yes.

1954
01:58:34.723 --> 01:58:36.125
Come here.

1955
01:58:36.225 --> 01:58:38.520
there is a man at the door.

1956
01:58:39.353 --> 01:58:41.522
He wants to marry you.

1957
01:58:41.605 --> 01:58:42.923
But I've never
seen him before.

1958
01:58:43.023 --> 01:58:44.383
Who cares?

1959
01:58:44.483 --> 01:58:46.677
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1960
01:58:46.777 --> 01:58:49.780
Sell? Who said
sell? I'll pay him.

1961
01:58:49.863 --> 01:58:51.954
Pardon me. I'm meaning...

1962
01:58:52.054 --> 01:58:54.604
your other daughter
- Aurelia.

1963
01:58:54.659 --> 01:58:58.354
She's not here - she's
at work. I'll take you.

1964
01:58:58.454 --> 01:58:59.897
You. Stay here.

1965
01:58:59.997 --> 01:59:02.917
As if I would. Stupid.

1966
01:59:05.878 --> 01:59:08.583
Father is about to
sell Aurelia...

1967
01:59:08.683 --> 01:59:11.233
as a slave to
this Englishman.

1968
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:16.514
Wait. Wait.

1969
01:59:19.892 --> 01:59:21.892
Oh. no.

1970
01:59:22.812 --> 01:59:24.630
You better not
say yes. Father.

1971
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:27.692
Shut up. Miss
Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1972
01:59:32.863 --> 01:59:34.890
Look. we're not
actually flying.

1973
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:36.433
You can't come through.

1974
01:59:36.533 --> 01:59:39.557
Not even to let the
boy say goodbye...

1975
01:59:39.657 --> 01:59:41.697
to the love of his life?

1976
01:59:42.664 --> 01:59:44.664
No.

1977
01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:49.880
I'm sorry. Sam.
- Boarding pass. sir?

1978
01:59:49.963 --> 01:59:51.913
Just a moment. I
know I've got it.

1979
01:59:52.013 --> 01:59:53.492
Would you hang on to that?

1980
01:59:53.592 --> 01:59:55.594
Unless...
- What?

1981
01:59:55.677 --> 01:59:57.330
Do you want to
make a run for it?

1982
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:58.205
Hold on to that.

1983
01:59:58.305 --> 02:00:00.807
You think I should?
- Yeah.

1984
02:00:01.474 --> 02:00:04.561
OK.
- Yes.

1985
02:00:04.644 --> 02:00:06.530
I must have left them...

1986
02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:09.605
where I was having
a cup of coffee.

1987
02:01:21.845 --> 02:01:24.414
Apparently he is
going to kill Aurelia.

1988
02:01:24.514 --> 02:01:26.683
Cool.

1989
02:02:00.966 --> 02:02:03.010
Joanna.

1990
02:02:04.094 --> 02:02:06.138
Sam?

1991
02:02:09.391 --> 02:02:12.484
I thought you didn't
know my name.

1992
02:02:12.584 --> 02:02:13.628
Course I do.

1993
02:02:13.728 --> 02:02:17.398
Oh. Jesus. Here.
I've gotta run.

1994
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:11.358
Where is Aurelia?

1995
02:03:11.458 --> 02:03:12.477
Why should I tell you?

1996
02:03:12.577 --> 02:03:14.563
This man wants
to marry her.

1997
02:03:14.663 --> 02:03:18.318
He can't do that -
she's our best waitress.

1998
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:38.350
Boa noite. Aurelia.

1999
02:03:39.687 --> 02:03:41.730
Boa noite. Jamie.

2000
02:03:57.079 --> 02:04:00.040
Beautiful Aurelia...

2001
02:04:00.124 --> 02:04:04.295
I've come here with a
view to asking you...

2002
02:04:05.421 --> 02:04:07.590
to marriage me.

2003
02:04:08.966 --> 02:04:11.667
I know I seems an
insane person...

2004
02:04:11.767 --> 02:04:14.232
because I hardly
knows you...

2005
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:22.395
but sometimes things
are so transparency.

2006
02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:27.108
they don't need
evidential proof.

2007
02:04:29.068 --> 02:04:31.327
And I will inhabit here.

2008
02:04:31.427 --> 02:04:35.033
or you can inhabit
with me in England.

2009
02:04:35.116 --> 02:04:37.602
Definitely go for
England. girl.

2010
02:04:37.702 --> 02:04:39.750
You'll meet Prince William...

2011
02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:41.898
then you can
marry him instead.

2012
02:04:41.998 --> 02:04:45.505
Of course I don't
expecting you...

2013
02:04:45.605 --> 02:04:47.962
to be as foolish as me.

2014
02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:53.550
and of course I
prediction you say no...

2015
02:04:54.676 --> 02:05:02.559
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to... check.

2016
02:05:06.813 --> 02:05:10.400
Oh. God - say yes.
you skinny moron.

2017
02:05:13.237 --> 02:05:15.280
Thank you.

2018
02:05:17.115 --> 02:05:19.159
That will be nice.

2019
02:05:21.453 --> 02:05:24.206
Yes is being my answer.

2020
02:05:25.916 --> 02:05:28.210
Easy question.

2021
02:05:28.293 --> 02:05:30.696
What
did you say?

2022
02:05:30.795 --> 02:05:32.321
Yes. of course.

2023
02:05:34.924 --> 02:05:37.218
Bravo.

2024
02:06:02.618 --> 02:06:05.168
You
learned English?

2025
02:06:05.288 --> 02:06:07.456
Just in cases.

2026
02:06:41.072 --> 02:06:43.867
I may not always love you

2027
02:06:44.868 --> 02:06:48.330
But long as there are
stars above you...

2028
02:06:48.413 --> 02:06:49.815
Hello. Daisy.

2029
02:06:49.915 --> 02:06:52.833
This one's Greta.
- Hello. Greta.

2030
02:06:52.917 --> 02:06:55.236
I'll make you so
sure about it...

2031
02:06:55.336 --> 02:06:59.323
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

2032
02:06:59.423 --> 02:07:02.535
Mark. didn't see you there.
- Just thought I'd tag along.

2033
02:07:02.635 --> 02:07:05.538
Jamie's friends are
so good-looking.

2034
02:07:05.638 --> 02:07:07.890
He never tells me this.

2035
02:07:07.973 --> 02:07:09.073
I think maybe now

2036
02:07:09.173 --> 02:07:11.085
I have made the
wrong choice.

2037
02:07:11.185 --> 02:07:12.837
picked wrong Englishman.

2038
02:07:12.937 --> 02:07:15.742
She can't speak
English properly.

2039
02:07:16.023 --> 02:07:18.150
Dad. Dad.

2040
02:07:20.361 --> 02:07:21.929
Oh. God.

2041
02:07:22.029 --> 02:07:23.768
Did you get us
any presents?

2042
02:07:23.868 --> 02:07:25.224
Matter of fact. I did.

2043
02:07:25.324 --> 02:07:27.743
Thanks. Dad.

2044
02:07:30.287 --> 02:07:33.373
How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

2045
02:07:35.458 --> 02:07:37.627
Good to have you back.

2046
02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:40.088
Come on. Home.

2047
02:07:42.882 --> 02:07:44.926
There she is.

2048
02:07:46.344 --> 02:07:50.098
Hi.
- Hello.

2049
02:07:50.181 --> 02:07:52.792
Aw. he should
have kissed her.

2050
02:07:52.892 --> 02:07:54.892
No. that's cool.

2051
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:57.229
All right?

2052
02:07:57.329 --> 02:07:59.716
Hey. What are you
two doing here?

2053
02:07:59.816 --> 02:08:02.302
I might get a shag at last.
- Naughty.

2054
02:08:02.402 --> 02:08:05.822
Got to go.
- Bye.

2055
02:08:05.905 --> 02:08:07.905
Yahoo.

2056
02:08:10.951 --> 02:08:13.370
Now. this is Harriet.

2057
02:08:14.496 --> 02:08:17.595
Hi. Really pleased
to meet you.

2058
02:08:17.695 --> 02:08:19.151
Hello. Harriet.

2059
02:08:19.251 --> 02:08:21.071
I hope you don't mind.

2060
02:08:21.171 --> 02:08:24.231
I sort of brought
my sister to stay.

2061
02:08:24.882 --> 02:08:29.303
This is Carla.
She's real friendly.

2062
02:08:29.386 --> 02:08:31.680
Hello. you must be Tony.

2063
02:08:33.557 --> 02:08:35.626
I heard you were gorgeous.

2064
02:08:35.726 --> 02:08:38.504
God only knows
what I'd be without you...

2065
02:08:40.564 --> 02:08:44.234
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2066
02:08:44.318 --> 02:08:47.863
God only knows
what I'd be without you...

2067
02:08:47.946 --> 02:08:51.515
God. you weigh a lot.
- Oh. shut your face.

2068
02:08:51.616 --> 02:08:54.510
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2069
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:55.645
God only knows

2070
02:08:55.745 --> 02:09:02.449
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2071
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:03.528
God only knows

2072
02:09:03.628 --> 02:09:10.545
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2073
02:09:10.645 --> 02:09:11.702
God only knows

2074
02:09:11.802 --> 02:09:18.345
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2075
02:09:18.445 --> 02:09:19.502
God only knows

2076
02:09:19.602 --> 02:09:26.295
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2077
02:09:26.395 --> 02:09:27.385
God only knows

2078
02:09:27.485 --> 02:09:34.294
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2079
02:09:34.394 --> 02:09:35.350
God only knows

2080
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:42.133
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2081
02:09:42.233 --> 02:09:43.233
God only knows

2082
02:09:43.333 --> 02:09:50.037
God only knows what
I'd be without you

2083
02:09:50.137 --> 02:09:51.116
God only knows

2084
02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:56.304
God only knows what
I'd be without you...

2085
02:10:15.239 --> 02:10:18.742
Love can be a many
splendored thing

2086
02:10:18.826 --> 02:10:22.913
Can't deny the joy it brings

2087
02:10:22.997 --> 02:10:26.375
A dozen roses.
diamond rings

2088
02:10:26.458 --> 02:10:30.588
Dreams for sale
and fairy tales

2089
02:10:30.671 --> 02:10:34.300
It'll make you
hear a symphony

2090
02:10:34.383 --> 02:10:38.220
And you just want
the world to see

2091
02:10:38.304 --> 02:10:41.932
But like a drug that
makes you blind

2092
02:10:42.016 --> 02:10:44.268
It'll fool ya every time

2093
02:10:44.351 --> 02:10:47.813
The trouble with love is

2094
02:10:49.064 --> 02:10:53.151
It can tear you up inside

2095
02:10:53.234 --> 02:10:57.113
Make your heart
believe a lie

2096
02:10:57.197 --> 02:11:00.158
It's stronger than your pride

2097
02:11:00.241 --> 02:11:04.496
The trouble with love is

2098
02:11:04.579 --> 02:11:08.791
It doesn't care
how fast you fall

2099
02:11:08.875 --> 02:11:12.545
And you can't
refuse the call

2100
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:15.673
See you got no say at all

2101
02:11:17.717 --> 02:11:21.387
Now I was once a
fool. it's true

2102
02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:25.475
I played the game
by all the rules

2103
02:11:25.558 --> 02:11:28.853
But now my world's
a deeper blue

2104
02:11:28.937 --> 02:11:32.272
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too

2105
02:11:33.232 --> 02:11:36.401
I swore I'd never love again

2106
02:11:37.194 --> 02:11:40.656
I swore my heart
would never mend

2107
02:11:41.281 --> 02:11:44.576
Said love wasn't
worth the pain

2108
02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:47.329
But then I hear
it call my name

2109
02:11:47.412 --> 02:11:51.708
The trouble with love is

2110
02:11:51.792 --> 02:11:55.754
It can tear you up inside

2111
02:11:55.838 --> 02:11:59.633
Make your heart
believe a lie

2112
02:11:59.716 --> 02:12:02.845
It's stronger than your pride

2113
02:12:02.928 --> 02:12:07.349
The trouble with love is

2114
02:12:07.432 --> 02:12:11.602
It doesn't care
how fast you fall

2115
02:12:11.686 --> 02:12:15.189
And you can't
refuse the call

2116
02:12:15.273 --> 02:12:18.234
See you got no say at all

2117
02:12:20.987 --> 02:12:23.739
Every time I turn around

2118
02:12:23.823 --> 02:12:27.410
I think I've got
it all figured out

2119
02:12:27.493 --> 02:12:31.414
My heart keeps calling
And I keep on falling

2120
02:12:31.497 --> 02:12:35.877
Over and over again

2121
02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:39.964
The sad story always
ends the same

2122
02:12:40.047 --> 02:12:42.842
Me standing in
the pouring rain

2123
02:12:43.801 --> 02:12:46.804
It seems no
matter what I do

2124
02:12:46.888 --> 02:12:49.682
It tears my heart in two

2125
02:12:49.765 --> 02:12:54.769
The trouble with love is
The trouble with love

2126
02:12:54.853 --> 02:12:58.507
It can tear you up inside
It can tear you up inside

2127
02:12:58.607 --> 02:13:00.801
Make your heart
believe a lie

2128
02:13:00.901 --> 02:13:03.095
Make your heart
believe a lie

2129
02:13:03.195 --> 02:13:05.472
It's stronger than your pride

2130
02:13:05.572 --> 02:13:07.452
The trouble with love is

2131
02:13:07.552 --> 02:13:10.477
It's in your heart.
it's in your soul

2132
02:13:10.577 --> 02:13:12.360
It doesn't care
how fast you fall

2133
02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:13.855
You're losing that control

2134
02:13:13.955 --> 02:13:17.918
And you can't
refuse the call

2135
02:13:18.001 --> 02:13:21.004
See you got no say at all

2136
02:13:21.087 --> 02:13:25.967
The trouble with love is
Ooh. yeah

2137
02:13:26.051 --> 02:13:30.222
It can tear you up inside
Ooh...

2138
02:13:37.436 --> 02:13:42.900
Your eyes tell me
how you want me

2139
02:13:42.983 --> 02:13:46.403
I can feel it in
your heartbeat

2140
02:13:46.487 --> 02:13:50.141
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

2141
02:13:50.241 --> 02:13:51.976
Oh baby

2142
02:13:52.076 --> 02:13:56.705
I'll take you down.
I'll take you down

2143
02:13:56.789 --> 02:13:59.191
Where no one's
ever gone before

2144
02:13:59.291 --> 02:14:01.152
And if you want more

2145
02:14:01.252 --> 02:14:05.339
If you want
more. more. more

2146
02:14:05.422 --> 02:14:09.009
Then jump for my love

2147
02:14:09.093 --> 02:14:10.827
Jump in

2148
02:14:10.927 --> 02:14:12.927
And feel my touch

2149
02:14:12.929 --> 02:14:13.929
Jump

2150
02:14:14.029 --> 02:14:16.166
If you want to taste
my kisses in the night

2151
02:14:16.266 --> 02:14:20.395
Then jump for my love

2152
02:14:20.478 --> 02:14:21.478
I know my heart

2153
02:14:21.578 --> 02:14:23.381
I know my heart
can make you happy

2154
02:14:23.481 --> 02:14:24.481
Jump in

2155
02:14:24.581 --> 02:14:27.051
You know these arms
can fill you up

2156
02:14:27.151 --> 02:14:28.151
Jump

2157
02:14:28.251 --> 02:14:30.555
If you want to taste
my kisses in the night

2158
02:14:30.655 --> 02:14:34.325
Then jump for my love

2159
02:14:35.305 --> 02:15:35.650
