Now. we have a body rotting
 arrives. that you think that we can do with that?

103
00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:57.848
Soon. when aoscuro we take it
 place to a secret and we bury it.

104
00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:00.885
Good if. if we can do that.

105
00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:07.696
it does not believe that it has relative that
 soon is trying to look for it.

106
00:08:13.363 --> 00:08:15.301
Parece a clear pain.

107
00:08:16.223 --> 00:08:16.694
Pain?

108
00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:21.038
lost Parece an ugly one.

109
00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:25.036
a so pretty picture.

110
00:08:25.681 --> 00:08:26.995
As it is its name�� was.

111
00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:29.722
Serious�� it was.

112
00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:32.272
Or it cannot be negotiated.

113
00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.199
businesses need alze.

114
00:08:37.674 --> 00:08:39.456
debts must erase.

115
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.703
Piensalo as a saving.

116
00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.004
Like a gift.

117
00:08:44.886 --> 00:08:45.665
If you understand to me.

118
00:08:47.585 --> 00:08:50.784
ugly Parece a lost one.

119
00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:53.872
That is to say.

120
00:08:54.523 --> 00:08:55.945
With the price of the meat. that is.

121
00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:58.356
When you understand it. if you understand it.

122
00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:01.085
Good. you understood it.

123
00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:04.259
For example it takes to Mrs.
 Martin and her store from pies.

124
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.850
businesses nape of the neck were
 better with toasted pussycats and.

125
00:09:09.573 --> 00:09:12.245
and now cats are good
 for six or seven to much.

126
00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.649
and I am sure that
 they cannot compare in the flavor.

127
00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:17.763
Srta Lovett. that charming notion��

128
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.715
practical and Eminently even appropriate as
always.

129
00:09:20.972 --> 00:09:23.514
Srta Lovett since I have lived without you
 these years without having it well-known.

130

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:30.686
Piense in all those pies.

133
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.830
As is the Earth sound outside?

134
00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:36.664
As is Mr. Todd? As is that sound?

135
00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.958
Those sounds saturating the air?

136
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.265
If Mr. Todd. by all around.

137
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.732
He is the man devouring
 to the dear man.

138
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.438
- And that somo we to deny it here?
 - And that somo we to deny it here?

139
00:09:55.004 --> 00:09:56.825
These are desperate
 moments Srta Lovett

140
00:09:58.782 --> 00:10:00.014
and are needed desperate measures.

141
00:10:01.863 --> 00:10:02.804
it is Here.

142
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.713
just exit of the furnace.

143
00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:06.703
That is that?

144
00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:10.028
He is a father. I have a small father.

145
00:10:10.698 --> 00:10:11.431
Is really good?

146
00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:13.283
Sir is very good. at least.

147
00:10:14.058 --> 00:10:18.459
and then they do not commit meat sins
 so it is fresh meat.

148
00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:21.954
Ugly lost of fat.

149
00:10:22.675 --> 00:10:23.726
Single where one feels.

150
00:10:24.405 --> 00:10:26.066
Does not have a poet or something thus?

151
00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:32.021
No. sides the problem with the poets
 is that like knowing if they estan dead?

152
00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:33.874
Pruebe to the father.

153
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.058
lawyers are something better.

154
00:10:46.008 --> 00:10:46.983
If it is by the price.

155
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:52.054
Ordene something but but. since
 nobody must swallow 2 times the same.

156
00:10:52.847 --> 00:10:53.811
Something that is thin.

157
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.966
Good if it is that he is British and loyal. 
 perhaps it it likes the Real Navy.

158
00:10:58.295 --> 00:11:00.460
and they are clean.

159
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.098
Clear that they know where there are been.

160
00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:07.705
And that escudero in the fire?

161
00:11:08.173 --> 00:11:11.641

Vendre again cuand
 otenga to the judge in the menu.

183

Sir. a horseman touches before
 entering the quarter of one young lady.
