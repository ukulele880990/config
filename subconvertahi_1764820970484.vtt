00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:49.924
<i>It all starts
with something... magnificent.</i>

3
00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.280
<i>A flower.</i>

4
00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:54.582
<i>Just a flower.</i>

5
00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.108
<i>Then a honeybee.</i>

6
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.376
<i>Very fragile.</i>

7
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.548
<i>Very complicated.</i>

8
00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:09.644
<i>The bee gathers pollen</i>

9
00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:13.735
<i>and deposits it
in another flower's stigma.</i>

10
00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:17.000
<i>It's like sex but cleaner.</i>

11
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.735
<i>And nobody gets hurt.</i>

12
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.823
A third of our food
is pollinated this way.

13
00:01:57.906 --> 00:02:00.256
You understand
the scope of that?

14
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:04.395
That's how vital
the bees are. Don.

15
00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.176
And they're dying.

16
00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:09.661
Why?

17
00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:12.751
It's like we talked about. cuz.
Remember?

18
00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.446
CCD. It's like a pandemic.

19
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.022
Workers desert the queen

20
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:26.895
until she's all alone
with her young.

21
00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:29.807
and the colony wastes away.

22
00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:36.858
But why do they leave her?

23
00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.691
Well...

24
00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:42.694
people claim it's pesticides
or habitat loss.

25
00:02:42.777 --> 00:02:44.957
Or some people think
world governments

26
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.482
and their agro-corporate
overlords

27
00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:52.352
bio engineered CCD
to manipulate food supplies.

28
00:02:53.744 --> 00:02:57.230
<i>But I knew there had to be</i>

29
00:02:57.313 --> 00:03:00.229
<i>a larger organizing
principle at work.</i>

30
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.884
<i>So I studied.</i>

31
00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:05.369
<i>I observed.</i>

32
00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:06.761
Down.

33
00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:08.676
<i>I searched in the ground</i>

34
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.462
<i>and in the stars</i>

35
00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.634
<i>until I found it.</i>

36
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.858
<i>It was there all along.</i>

37
00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:28.914
<i>Fucking caging us. poisoning us.</i>

38
00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:31.042
<i>choking us out.</i>

39
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.440
One. Two.

40
00:03:33.523 --> 00:03:35.877
<i>We are not steering
the ship. Don.</i>

41
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.531
Oh. good job.

42
00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:39.442
<i>They are.</i>

43
00:03:42.358 --> 00:03:45.670
<i>And now it's up to you and me</i>

44
00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:47.755
<i>to stop them.</i>

45
00:03:49.974 --> 00:03:53.112
<i>The training
is for a reason. Don.</i>

46
00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:55.245
<i>It's going to try
and dominate us.</i>

47
00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:58.248
<i>but we're not gonna
let it. are we?</i>

48
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.338
You mean she'll try to hurt us?

49
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.900
<i>Oh. yes. Don.
It's highly dangerous.</i>

50
00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:10.216
<i>So we have to prepare...</i>

51
00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.132
-Down. Up.
<i>-...our bodies. our brains.</i>

52
00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.260
Come on. Come on. Come on.

53
00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:28.843
Why are you laughing?

54
00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:30.584
Sorry. you just look
a little funny doing that.

55
00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:31.933
to be honest. Sorry. Teddy.

56
00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:33.757
-Okay. well. now you do it.
-Okay.

57
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.941
Hey. I think I look funny. too.

58
00:04:40.024 --> 00:04:41.548
Okay.

59
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.681
See? It's good.

60
00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:52.210
<i>Oh. and don't forget
they track it remotely.</i>

61
00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:55.823
<i>And they'll try
and track us. too.</i>

62
00:04:57.477 --> 00:05:01.224
<i>It'll... weevil into your
brain box every chance it gets.</i>

63
00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:03.961
<i>so we have to fortify that shit.</i>

64
00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:08.226
Okay.

65
00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:11.364
I'll try.

66
00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:13.540
You-you hear that. though?

67
00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:15.412
Donny?

68
00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:17.758
In your voice. how they
fucked your confidence?

69
00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.809
I'm sorry. Teddy.

70
00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:25.418
No. Donny. look at me.

71
00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.033
Don't you ever apologize. Ever.

72
00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:30.509
None of this
is your fault. Okay?

73
00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:34.383
Thanks.

74
00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:39.779
<i>It won't play fair.</i>

75
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:43.653
<i>So we have to be better.</i>

76
00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:49.881
How can you tell them apart?

77
00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:52.797
Well. you have to know
where to look.

78
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.142
There are signs.

79
00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.890
What about these people?

80
00:05:58.973 --> 00:06:01.414
No.

81
00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:03.503
No. they're fine.

82
00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:06.506
I mean. they're not fine-fine.

83
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.682
but hollowed.

84
00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:10.249
You know. like the rest of us.

85
00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:11.859
Harmless.

86
00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.248
Hopeless.

87
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.910
<i>And that's the way
they planned it.</i>

88
00:06:18.993 --> 00:06:22.740
<i>To make us the same as the bees.</i>

89
00:06:22.823 --> 00:06:28.136
<i>A dead colony. atomized
in a trillion directions</i>

90
00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.874
<i>with no way home again.</i>

91
00:06:36.837 --> 00:06:38.712
-Morning. Ms. Fuller.
-Good morning.

92
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:40.710
Have a good day.

93
00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:02.649
<i>What does the cream do?</i>

94
00:07:02.732 --> 00:07:03.955
The same.

95
00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:05.696
Mitigation.

96
00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:07.257
Here. get all of it.

97
00:07:35.548 --> 00:07:38.250
What if someone finds out
about what we're doing?

98
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.860
They won't.

99
00:07:39.943 --> 00:07:42.089
No one on earth gives
a single fuck about us.

100
00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:48.909
So until the day comes...

101
00:07:50.563 --> 00:07:53.348
...we clear
the psychic cache. okay?

102
00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.355
No distractions.

103
00:07:56.438 --> 00:07:59.441
No gaming. no vape.
no whacking it.

104
00:08:01.312 --> 00:08:05.012
No screens whatsoever.
except for research.

105
00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:08.494
You promise. Don?

106
00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.372
I know this is a lot.

107
00:08:13.455 --> 00:08:16.114
but I...
I want you with me on this.

108
00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.595
I need you. Don.

109
00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:20.161
-Hmm.
-I know...

110
00:08:20.244 --> 00:08:24.339
you're actually smart and brave.

111
00:08:24.422 --> 00:08:27.251
and no one else sees it but me.

112
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.218
No. you're...
No. you're the smart one.

113
00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:37.174
The brains of this
operation. really. Hmm.

114
00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:43.180
-Hmm. But...
-Is something wrong?

115
00:08:45.052 --> 00:08:46.710
I just...

116
00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.363
I don't think I can do this.

117
00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:49.669
Hey.

118
00:08:49.752 --> 00:08:51.149
Come here.

119
00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:52.803
Hmm.

120
00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:55.022
-Give me a hug.
-Ah.

121
00:08:55.105 --> 00:08:56.676
I love you. cuzzie.

122
00:08:56.759 --> 00:08:59.849
I love you. too. man.

123
00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:06.421
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

124
00:09:07.378 --> 00:09:09.341
My only friend.

125
00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.427
And I'm doing this
to save you most of all.

126
00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:16.213
I won't let anyone
hurt you. okay?

127
00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:19.394
Okay?

128
00:09:19.477 --> 00:09:21.309
-Okay.
-Never.

129
00:09:21.392 --> 00:09:22.528
Yeah.

130
00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:25.527
Medroxyprogesterone acetate.

131
00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:29.923
It's a progestin-type
hormonal med.

132
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:34.057
Chemical castration.

133
00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:38.192
-Okay?
-Okay.

134
00:09:42.152 --> 00:09:46.813
In order for us to hit
maximum focus.

135
00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:52.075
we have to clear our heads of
all psychic compulsions. okay?

136
00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:55.213
What does that mean?

137
00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:56.910
Hey. buddy.

138
00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:59.696
Trust me. I've done
a shit ton of research on this.

139
00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:01.698
The more of that
fuck filler we have

140
00:10:01.781 --> 00:10:03.438
jamming up our neurons.

141
00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:06.307
the bigger advantage
it will have over us.

142
00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:08.830
Are you sure?

143
00:10:10.137 --> 00:10:11.617
Yes. Donny. I'm sure.

144
00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:15.969
It's really important. Don.

145
00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:21.065
I just...

146
00:10:21.148 --> 00:10:25.718
wanted to be
with someone someday.

147
00:10:27.807 --> 00:10:29.552
Bud...

148
00:10:29.635 --> 00:10:31.075
you gotta believe me.

149
00:10:31.158 --> 00:10:32.986
I've figured it out.

150
00:10:34.727 --> 00:10:37.995
The part of your brain
that distracts you.

151
00:10:38.078 --> 00:10:39.910
part of your brain
that makes you sad.

152
00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:43.043
it's all connected
to the biological imperative.

153
00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:47.004
These synapses firing off
on procreation

154
00:10:47.087 --> 00:10:51.791
and seed spread and monogamy.

155
00:10:51.874 --> 00:10:54.834
like all these
fucking pain traps.

156
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.365
It's all...
it's all neurons. dude.

157
00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:02.972
You just have to harness them.

158
00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:07.111
Once you kill the urges.
like I have.

159
00:11:07.194 --> 00:11:10.284
you'll be your own master.

160
00:11:12.242 --> 00:11:14.118
No one can fuck with you.

161
00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:16.594
You'll be totally free.

162
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.033
Don't you want to be free?

163
00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:23.823
Yes.

164
00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:25.691
So you ready?

165
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.608
Let's do this.

166
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.267
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

167
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.226
Okay. so. uh...

168
00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:37.402
Lean over the chair
and talk to me.

169
00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:39.273
-It'll distract you.
-Yeah.

170
00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:41.449
How are you. Teddy?

171
00:11:41.532 --> 00:11:42.973
I'm doing great. man.

172
00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:44.627
How are you?

173
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.325
Uh. I'm doing good.

174
00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:49.806
So. you excited to be free?

175
00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:51.242
Yeah.

176
00:11:51.325 --> 00:11:53.374
What does free feel like to you?

177
00:11:53.457 --> 00:11:55.725
I guess it...

178
00:11:55.808 --> 00:11:58.336
feels like when we were little.

179
00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:00.730
before things got bad.

180
00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:03.729
When everyone was still here.

181
00:12:04.904 --> 00:12:07.998
Hey. hey.

182
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.044
I know it's been hard. man.

183
00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:15.566
But we're gonna get it
back again. I promise.

184
00:12:16.567 --> 00:12:19.096
<i>All we've lost.</i>

185
00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:22.312
<i>all these years. all the shit
that's been done to us...</i>

186
00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.490
<i>...we're setting that shit
right again.</i>

187
00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:30.281
<i>And no one can fuck with us.</i>

188
00:12:30.364 --> 00:12:32.283
<i>Not even ourselves.</i>

189
00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:35.108
-Morning. Corey.
-Good morning. Michelle.

190
00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:03.749
I believe every company
should strive

191
00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:05.925
to form a diverse table.

192
00:13:06.008 --> 00:13:08.319
If the people on your team
are from diverse backgrounds.

193
00:13:08.402 --> 00:13:10.843
they'll find new and creative
solutions to problems

194
00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:12.584
rather than just iterating.

195
00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.238
We need to find
the next generation

196
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:15.587
of diverse engineers.

197
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.981
diverse biologists.
diverse doctors.

198
00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:20.287
Because it's not just
diverse employees.

199
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.811
it's diverse thinking.

200
00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:24.552
It's about using
our corporate resources

201
00:13:24.635 --> 00:13:29.296
to empower people of different
skills and identities...

202
00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:30.863
Holy fucking fucker.

203
00:13:30.946 --> 00:13:32.082
Jesus Christ.

204
00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:33.997
Every time. What is it?

205
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.694
"Skills and identities
to foster..."

206
00:13:35.777 --> 00:13:36.869
To foster a new
generation of Auxolith talent.

207
00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:38.127
Okay. let's reset.

208
00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:40.743
It's too many "diverses." Chris.

209
00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:42.309
It's... I'm going.
"diverse. diverse. diverse."

210
00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:43.920
Like "Buh-duh.
buh-duh. buh-duh."

211
00:13:44.003 --> 00:13:45.573
Like a fucking metronome.

212
00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:48.838
Well. uh. [clears throat].
it is diversity training.

213
00:13:48.921 --> 00:13:50.491
Yeah. but it's too many. Chris.

214
00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:52.755
Can we try to diversify
the language a little bit?

215
00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:55.061
No. sure.

216
00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:56.885
Let's go again.

217
00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:02.982
Okay. so that's it then.

218
00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:04.897
You just have
the investor call with Sara

219
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.553
and a VC with Wieden+Kennedy
at 9:00 that you can do remote.

220
00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:11.425
Thank you. Corey.

221
00:14:11.508 --> 00:14:12.862
The 5:30 thing.

222
00:14:12.945 --> 00:14:14.385
Uh-huh?

223
00:14:14.468 --> 00:14:15.734
Look. I know you sent
the email already.

224
00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:17.083
but I need you
to let everyone know

225
00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.476
that they are free
to leave at 5:30

226
00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.521
from now on.
starting today. okay?

227
00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:22.480
But do it in a way
that's. you know.

228
00:14:22.563 --> 00:14:24.003
what we talked about.

229
00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:25.744
-Yeah. of course.
-We need to send the message

230
00:14:25.827 --> 00:14:27.441
that we have a new culture
here now.

231
00:14:27.524 --> 00:14:29.182
Where people should.
yes. of course.

232
00:14:29.265 --> 00:14:31.271
feel free to leave at 5:30
and be with their families.

233
00:14:31.354 --> 00:14:33.186
No one is gonna be overworked
like in the past.

234
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.275
No more unpleasant incidents.

235
00:14:35.358 --> 00:14:37.364
But. of course.
it's not compulsory.

236
00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:39.279
And. obviously. if people
still have work to do.

237
00:14:39.362 --> 00:14:41.325
they should absolutely stay
and continue to work.

238
00:14:41.408 --> 00:14:43.675
-Yeah.
-But it's not strictly enforced.

239
00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.895
Although we still do want
to meet quotas.

240
00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:48.027
So if we can do that
with no pressure.

241
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.986
just remembering. you know.
we are running a business here.

242
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:52.118
so "let your conscience
guide you" kind of thing.

243
00:14:52.201 --> 00:14:53.554
Yeah? Good?

244
00:14:53.637 --> 00:14:54.947
I'll definitely let them know.

245
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.688
Great.

246
00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.081
New era.

247
00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:00.601
Thank you. Corey.

248
00:15:07.477 --> 00:15:08.700
Thanks. Tony.

249
00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.658
Feel free to leave early.

250
00:15:10.741 --> 00:15:12.486
I mean. unless you're busy.

251
00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:15.533
Or you have things to do.
but feel free if you can.

252
00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:17.187
-Up to you.
-Yes. ma'am.

253
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.053

Shit! Fuck. fuck!

269
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:36.800
No. no. no! Stay back with her.

270
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:48.595
Spray! Spray!

271
00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:12.840
Really have to hurry. bud.

272
00:18:12.923 --> 00:18:15.582
-Um. I know. I'm sorry.
-Okay. quick as you can.

273
00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:17.845
It's like GPS. remember?

274
00:18:17.928 --> 00:18:20.370
If its hair is still attached.
it can track us remotely.

275
00:18:20.453 --> 00:18:22.154
so we want to go
as quick as we can.

276
00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:24.069
Okay.

277
00:18:24.152 --> 00:18:25.418
Is it working?

278
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:28.508
Not much is coming off.

279
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:30.467
Y-You really. you really
got to run it through. Harder.

280
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.295
But wh-what if I cut her?

281
00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:34.601
Don! Do it harder!
You won't cut her!

282
00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:35.771
Okay.

283
00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:01.237
Man. I feel good. Don't you?

284
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.542
I guess.

285
00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:04.457
You were amazing. cuz.

286
00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.676
I was?

287
00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.286
Oh. yeah.

288
00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:09.767
Fucking alpha king shit.

289
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.639
Well. thanks. man.

290
00:19:12.722 --> 00:19:14.076
I knew you could do it.

291
00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:17.640
Sure enough.
you fucking crushed it.

292
00:19:23.907 --> 00:19:25.522
Incredible.

293
00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:27.306
What is?

294
00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:29.961
Just the detail.

295
00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.615
The best I've seen.

296
00:19:31.698 --> 00:19:34.748
Uh. how can you tell
she's an alien?

297
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:39.101
Well. the signs are obvious.

298
00:19:39.184 --> 00:19:41.320
They did a hell of a job on it.
but the tells are there.

299
00:19:41.403 --> 00:19:43.540
Narrow feet.

300
00:19:43.623 --> 00:19:46.499
Thin cuticles.

301
00:19:46.582 --> 00:19:49.194
Slight overbite.

302
00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:55.204
Semi-obtruding earlobes.

303
00:19:55.287 --> 00:19:56.466
See?

304
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:58.990
High hair density.

305
00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:02.994
You won't notice unless you know
what you're looking for.

306
00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:05.344
Guess I can see it.

307
00:20:05.427 --> 00:20:09.914
It's like.
if you don't cook steaks a lot.

308
00:20:09.997 --> 00:20:11.785
you won't know
when it's cooked medium-rare.

309
00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:16.312
but if you cook steaks
all the time. you just know.

310
00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:18.096
You don't even
have to cut into it.

311
00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:20.747
You just... know.

312
00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:26.017
Hey. hey. um...

313
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.280
Why are we doing this?

314
00:20:28.363 --> 00:20:29.847
Is she itchy?

315
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.719
No. Don. It's not itchy.

316
00:20:32.802 --> 00:20:36.114
Its genetic structure
is the same as ours.

317
00:20:36.197 --> 00:20:39.117
uh. but its nervous system
is different.

318
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.772
The antihistamine reacts
to the neurotransmitters

319
00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:44.862
in its nervous system
and weakens it.

320
00:20:44.945 --> 00:20:48.170
We're just leveling
the playing field.

321
00:20:48.253 --> 00:20:51.651
It's not torture.
Torture is what it's done to us.

322
00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:54.132
Huh.

323
00:20:54.215 --> 00:20:56.221
The sedative
should wear off soon.

324
00:20:56.304 --> 00:20:57.831
Should we go get dressed?

325
00:20:57.914 --> 00:20:59.785
-Okay.
-Okay. come on.

326
00:21:14.061 --> 00:21:16.498
-Is it too tight?
-No. man.

327
00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:20.071
No. this was my dad's shit.

328
00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.769
He left it behind for a reason.

329
00:21:22.852 --> 00:21:24.898
so that it could be
put to good use.

330
00:21:25.942 --> 00:21:28.205
Everything's for a reason. Don.

331
00:21:29.424 --> 00:21:31.125
It's too tight.

332
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:33.476
-I look stupid.
-No. you don't.

333
00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:36.218
You look fine. honestly.
You look fine.

334
00:21:36.301 --> 00:21:38.829
Anyway...
what's that swine gonna do.

335
00:21:38.912 --> 00:21:41.745
call the fashion police
and arrest you?

336
00:21:41.828 --> 00:21:44.400
This isn't about her.

337
00:21:44.483 --> 00:21:46.184
Hey.

338
00:21:46.267 --> 00:21:49.361
It is not in control anymore.

339
00:21:49.444 --> 00:21:50.750
We are.

340
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.715
Besides. I'll be doing
most of the talking anyway.

341
00:21:55.798 --> 00:21:59.023
In fact. maybe don't say much.

342
00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:00.938
Like. you-you don't really
have to say much.

343
00:22:01.021 --> 00:22:02.809
Okay.

344
00:22:02.892 --> 00:22:05.899
Like. don't talk at all. maybe.

345
00:22:05.982 --> 00:22:07.505
Oh.

346
00:22:31.878 --> 00:22:33.314
Welcome.

347
00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:37.191
Are you conscious?

348
00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:40.238
-What?
-Is she conscious?

349
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:43.763
I can only proceed if
you're fully conscious. so...

350
00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:45.548
Uh...

351
00:22:45.631 --> 00:22:46.897
What?

352
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.899
Yes. Greetings.

353
00:22:48.982 --> 00:22:50.505
This is my home.

354
00:22:52.072 --> 00:22:53.595
Where...

355
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.605
This I... this is a hospital?

356
00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:03.566
-No. this is not a hospital.
-Is this a...

357
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:06.569
Fuck it. I'm just gonna start.

358
00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:09.702
"Welcome to the headquarters
of the human resistance.

359
00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:12.357
"Despite our general suspicion
and disavowal

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.403
"of all extant governing bodies.

361
00:23:14.486 --> 00:23:16.970
"and despite the fact that you.
as an Andromedan.

362
00:23:17.053 --> 00:23:19.016
"are not subject to
the human rights guidelines

363
00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:21.061
"detailed in
the Geneva Conventions.

364
00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:22.933
"we nevertheless endeavor
to adhere to those guidelines

365
00:23:23.016 --> 00:23:25.714
out of the humanist principles
to which they aspire."

366
00:23:26.933 --> 00:23:28.373
What is happening?

367
00:23:28.456 --> 00:23:30.332
I'm explaining to you
that I would like to keep

368
00:23:30.415 --> 00:23:35.293
all of this very aboveboard
and civilized. so...

369
00:23:35.376 --> 00:23:36.903
Where's my hair?

370
00:23:36.986 --> 00:23:39.819
-Your hair's been destroyed.
-You shaved off my hair?

371
00:23:39.902 --> 00:23:41.908
Yes. we've shaved off your hair.

372
00:23:41.991 --> 00:23:44.389
Why have you shaved off my hair?

373
00:23:44.472 --> 00:23:47.606
To prevent you
from contacting your ship.

374
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.870
-My ship?
-Your ship.

375
00:23:51.827 --> 00:23:53.829
What ship?

376
00:23:54.874 --> 00:23:56.353
Your mother ship.

377
00:23:58.312 --> 00:24:01.145
-Okay.
-Full disclosure:

378
00:24:01.228 --> 00:24:02.538
I've also applied a thin layer

379
00:24:02.621 --> 00:24:04.322
of antihistamine cream
to your skin...

380
00:24:04.405 --> 00:24:06.411
-Excuse me. Listen to me.
-...which we'll need to reapply

381
00:24:06.494 --> 00:24:07.586
every day
for full effectiveness.

382
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:09.454
Listen to me.

383
00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:13.070
I'm listening.

384
00:24:13.153 --> 00:24:14.328
Right.

385
00:24:15.938 --> 00:24:18.684
H-Here's what's gonna happen.

386
00:24:18.767 --> 00:24:22.122
And I want to be clear.
I'm not threatening you.

387
00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:23.428
Or you.

388
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:26.518
But the following is
my best guess

389
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:30.479
of how the next 48 hours
are likely to transpire.

390
00:24:30.562 --> 00:24:32.611
The police
and soon thereafter the FBI

391
00:24:32.694 --> 00:24:34.047
will begin a statewide manhunt

392
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.310
using all of the methods
at their disposal

393
00:24:36.393 --> 00:24:40.010
and the combined resources
of neighboring jurisdictions.

394
00:24:40.093 --> 00:24:43.622
My company is a key job creator

395
00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:45.711
and economic engine
of the region.

396
00:24:45.794 --> 00:24:47.191
I am crucial.

397
00:24:47.274 --> 00:24:50.194
Think of it like
you've abducted the governor

398
00:24:50.277 --> 00:24:51.674
but worse.

399
00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:53.240
That's the level
of bureaucratic urgency

400
00:24:53.323 --> 00:24:54.459
you're contending with here.

401
00:24:54.542 --> 00:24:56.461
In all humility. I can say that.

402
00:24:56.544 --> 00:24:59.682
I'm also a high-profile
female corporate executive.

403
00:24:59.765 --> 00:25:01.118
Does that add a certain.

404
00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:02.641
you know.
politicized optics to this?

405
00:25:02.724 --> 00:25:04.034
I would say absolutely.

406
00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:06.253
I would say
that's a tremendous factor

407
00:25:06.336 --> 00:25:08.299
for you to consider here.

408
00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:10.388
Now. I don't make the rules.
and I don't enforce anything.

409
00:25:10.471 --> 00:25:13.913
and I am not in charge
of the situation in this room.

410
00:25:13.996 --> 00:25:15.698
You are.

411
00:25:15.781 --> 00:25:18.918
But you are not in charge
of what is happening out there.

412
00:25:19.001 --> 00:25:22.226
and what is happening out there
is a rapid cross-coordination

413
00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:24.271
of law enforcement
and digital media.

414
00:25:24.354 --> 00:25:25.664
which is all leading
quite inevitably

415
00:25:25.747 --> 00:25:27.623
to your imprisonment.

416
00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:30.103
And very likely worse.

417
00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:31.927
If I can be frank.

418
00:25:33.755 --> 00:25:35.935
I-I'm not privy to
what their methods might be

419
00:25:36.018 --> 00:25:39.461
under extreme duress.
or yours for that matter.

420
00:25:39.544 --> 00:25:43.290
but I can assure you that
there is no possible scenario

421
00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:44.901
where you benefit
from this incident.

422
00:25:44.984 --> 00:25:48.165
unless you cooperate with me
right now

423
00:25:48.248 --> 00:25:51.556
and negotiate a deal that's fair
and advantageous to us both.

424
00:25:59.215 --> 00:26:00.346
Okay.

425
00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:04.264
Wow.

426
00:26:05.787 --> 00:26:08.790
That was really good.
That was really good.

427
00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:12.145
My pulse is racing right now.

428
00:26:12.228 --> 00:26:14.278
Um...

429
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:15.801
Fuck.

430
00:26:15.884 --> 00:26:18.369
You got a real human response
out of me there.

431
00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:21.764
which is impressive given your
cellular composition and all.

432
00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:24.114
-It-It's the truth.
-Well. no. it's not the truth.

433
00:26:24.197 --> 00:26:25.985
Nothing you say is true.

434
00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:30.203
Objective human truth has no
value in Andromedan cognition.

435
00:26:31.334 --> 00:26:33.732
L-Let's just unpack
the problem here.

436
00:26:33.815 --> 00:26:35.821
"Unpack"? Wow. heady shit.

437
00:26:35.904 --> 00:26:39.042
Sure. let's unpack
the old fact bag. shall we?

438
00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:44.613
You are a high-ranking official
in the royal Andromedan court.

439
00:26:44.696 --> 00:26:48.791
and you've aided your species
in the techno-enslavement

440
00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:50.749
and the agro-corporate
disintegration

441
00:26:50.832 --> 00:26:53.360
of planet Earth. okay?

442
00:26:53.443 --> 00:26:55.798
And we need you to bring us
to your mother ship

443
00:26:55.881 --> 00:26:58.191
on the night
of the lunar eclipse

444
00:26:58.274 --> 00:27:01.368
to broker a sit-down
with your royal superiors.

445
00:27:01.451 --> 00:27:04.110
How's that?
Fucking unpacked enough for ya?

446
00:27:04.193 --> 00:27:05.677
I hear where you're coming from.

447
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.244
I do.

448
00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:09.507
And I respectfully disagree.

449
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.505
On which part?

450
00:27:12.941 --> 00:27:14.860
-Primarily. I'm not an alien.
-You are.

451
00:27:14.943 --> 00:27:17.559
I've done thermal imaging
on your face.

452
00:27:17.642 --> 00:27:19.996
There's Andromedan code
all over your Instagram.

453
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:22.168
You're barely even hiding it.

454
00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:25.131
I mean. look at you.

455
00:27:25.214 --> 00:27:29.179
I'm supposed to believe
you're a 45-year-old woman?

456
00:27:29.262 --> 00:27:30.702
Human woman?

457
00:27:30.785 --> 00:27:32.574
I mean. I follow a very strict

458
00:27:32.657 --> 00:27:35.446
reverse-aging diet
and therapy program.

459
00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:38.505
It's very expensive. as you can
imagine. but I'm not an alien.

460
00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:41.104
Well. there's really
no time for this.

461
00:27:41.187 --> 00:27:42.970
-You are.
-I'm not.

462
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.461
All right. then.

463
00:27:50.544 --> 00:27:53.029
We're going to give you
the night...

464
00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:55.292
to give your statement.

465
00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:57.033
My statement?

466
00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:58.687
That you will give
to your emperor...

467
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.036
Uh-huh.

468
00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:02.342
...to grant us passage
to your ship

469
00:28:02.425 --> 00:28:05.389
and negotiate your species'
withdrawal from planet Earth.

470
00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:08.218
Right. C-Could we have
a dialogue about this. please?

471
00:28:08.301 --> 00:28:11.743
Because what you're asking me
to do is not quite clear to me.

472
00:28:11.826 --> 00:28:13.179
I think it is.

473
00:28:13.262 --> 00:28:16.048
And I want you to know...

474
00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:20.617
...this is really difficult
for me as well.

475
00:28:21.749 --> 00:28:23.146
You killed my family.

476
00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:26.540
You killed my community.
You killed my coworkers.

477
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:28.542
You killed the bees.

478
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:30.457
So. given that.

479
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.939
you should really appreciate
how super professional

480
00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:36.329
I'm being right now
by not gutting you.

481
00:28:47.862 --> 00:28:51.653
So. your sustenance
and waste disposal

482
00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:53.480
will be attended to
in the morning.

483
00:28:53.563 --> 00:28:56.396
Uh. I haven't gathered
adequate data

484
00:28:56.479 --> 00:28:59.443
on what type of sleep
you require. if any.

485
00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:01.963
but you should try
and get some. okay?

486
00:29:05.575 --> 00:29:07.320
I'm very sorry.

487
00:29:07.403 --> 00:29:11.673
I think that we maybe
got off on the wrong foot.

488
00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:15.672
And I would love to keep
the conversation going. please.

489
00:29:16.586 --> 00:29:19.593
Excuse me. please?

490
00:29:19.676 --> 00:29:21.508
Don. Don. Don. come on.

491
00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:23.680
Come on. let's keep talking.

492
00:29:24.638 --> 00:29:26.118
Please?

493
00:29:28.555 --> 00:29:29.773
Please?!

494
00:29:44.397 --> 00:29:46.093
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

495
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.881
Don. Don. Don. Don!

496
00:30:19.998 --> 00:30:22.004
Hey.

497
00:30:22.087 --> 00:30:28.184
We can't see it as
a human woman. you know?

498
00:30:28.267 --> 00:30:31.274
It's not a person
named Michelle Fuller.

499
00:30:31.357 --> 00:30:34.229
It's the Fuller Humanoid.
That's all it is.

500
00:30:35.404 --> 00:30:38.281
Even if it was human...
and it's not...

501
00:30:38.364 --> 00:30:39.935
it's still evil.

502
00:30:40.018 --> 00:30:43.155
Pure corporate evil.

503
00:30:43.238 --> 00:30:46.289
It's killing our planet. cuzzie.

504
00:30:46.372 --> 00:30:47.899
It was the lead executive

505
00:30:47.982 --> 00:30:49.640
on the neonicotinoid
linked to honeybee death.

506
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:51.681
It only knows cruelty.

507
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.599
Is it an alien?

508
00:30:57.905 --> 00:30:59.689
Yes.

509
00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:06.958
It knows you're watching
right now. too.

510
00:31:08.046 --> 00:31:09.573
It's trying to gain
your sympathy.

511
00:31:09.656 --> 00:31:11.183
That shitty way
that you feel right now.

512
00:31:11.266 --> 00:31:12.837
that's how it wants you to feel.

513
00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.101
It's mastered the art
of emotional manipulation.

514
00:31:16.184 --> 00:31:17.624
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:17.707 --> 00:31:22.499
I-I promise
I won't mess this up. Teddy.

516
00:31:22.582 --> 00:31:24.758
Don't apologize. remember?

517
00:31:25.933 --> 00:31:28.635
We just stick to the plan.

518
00:31:28.718 --> 00:31:31.334
We have four days
until the lunar eclipse.

519
00:31:31.417 --> 00:31:34.859
when the Andromedan ship
can return undetected. Yeah?

520
00:31:34.942 --> 00:31:36.687
Yeah.

521
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.518
So. we need the Fuller Humanoid
to help us make contact

522
00:31:41.601 --> 00:31:45.696
so we can fight
for our self-worth.

523
00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:48.699
For our material existence. Don.

524
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:51.920
You know. I... wish
I could fix everything

525
00:31:52.003 --> 00:31:54.875
that's been done to you.

526
00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:57.877
This is not about me. Don.

527
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:02.408
This is about everyone.

528
00:32:02.491 --> 00:32:06.843
And one day very soon.
you'll see.

529
00:32:08.758 --> 00:32:12.592
And the world will see you
as you truly are.

530
00:32:12.675 --> 00:32:14.290
A hero.

531
00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:18.468
That's why we stick to...

532
00:32:18.551 --> 00:32:22.211
We stick to...

533
00:32:22.294 --> 00:32:24.557
-the plan.
-Plan.

534
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.173
-Uh...
-See? You're listening.

535
00:32:28.256 --> 00:32:30.215
Uh. yeah.

536
00:33:04.423 --> 00:33:07.169
I don't even
fucking know what's in it.

537
00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:10.041
I just eat the poison
they give me.

538
00:33:10.124 --> 00:33:12.826
But I know...

539
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:15.481
they hide shit in there.

540
00:33:15.564 --> 00:33:19.090
to program my cells...

541
00:33:20.352 --> 00:33:22.924
...my blood.

542
00:33:23.007 --> 00:33:26.362
I see what their plan is. okay?

543
00:33:26.445 --> 00:33:28.799
<i>They sell me the sickness.
then they sell me the cure.</i>

544
00:33:28.882 --> 00:33:31.758
<i>and it's money on both sides</i>

545
00:33:31.841 --> 00:33:34.109
<i>from the mind control.</i>

546
00:33:34.192 --> 00:33:38.504
um... industry. okay?

547
00:33:38.587 --> 00:33:40.589
Get it?

548
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.679
But I'll do it for you.

549
00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:47.205
You know. if it helps.

550
00:33:48.684 --> 00:33:50.425
If it makes me not like me.

551
00:33:51.426 --> 00:33:52.475
<i>Like I am. you know?</i>

552
00:33:52.558 --> 00:33:55.434
<i>Like. weak.</i>

553
00:33:55.517 --> 00:33:59.521
<i>Your slob. cunt mom
will do it for you. baby.</i>

554
00:34:00.609 --> 00:34:03.524
Just don't let them
get you. too.

555
00:34:40.997 --> 00:34:42.264
You can go faster.

556
00:34:42.347 --> 00:34:44.262
-This isn't the spa.
-Okay. Okay.

557
00:34:55.055 --> 00:34:56.887
PODCAST HOST [over headphones]:
With scientific evidence

558
00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.932
pointing to the potential
of other life

559
00:34:59.015 --> 00:35:02.936
even on our own planet
that we can't comprehend yet.

560
00:35:03.019 --> 00:35:05.287
and with unexplainable
phenomenon

561
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.029
experienced by people daily
in the skies.

562
00:35:08.112 --> 00:35:11.293
in the oceans. and even
in their own backyard.

563
00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:13.686
I think it's kind of
just a little uninformed

564
00:35:13.769 --> 00:35:16.428
to not at least acknowledge
the potential

565
00:35:16.511 --> 00:35:20.650
that humankind may not be
the only intelligent life

566
00:35:20.733 --> 00:35:23.343
to ever exist
throughout the galaxy.

567
00:35:39.317 --> 00:35:40.452
...other higher-intelligent

568
00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:41.975
beings somewhere.

569
00:35:42.058 --> 00:35:43.934
I don't know if they're
coming. like I said.

570
00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:45.892
through the vibrations.
coming through frequencies

571
00:35:45.975 --> 00:35:47.590
into our world.
or if they're coming through...

572
00:35:47.673 --> 00:35:49.461
...trillions and billions

573
00:35:49.544 --> 00:35:51.985
of miles of space.
which seems kind of ridiculous

574
00:35:52.068 --> 00:35:53.596
when you think about it. but...

575
00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:55.902
-There's a whole...
-But what if it's...

576
00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:57.556
what if it's both
of those things?

577
00:35:57.639 --> 00:35:59.297
What if it's not one
or the other?

578
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.624
-It-it could be a mixture of everything.
-Yeah.

579
00:36:05.865 --> 00:36:07.566
Hey.

580
00:36:07.649 --> 00:36:09.655
Saw you there. You all right?

581
00:36:09.738 --> 00:36:12.919
Uh. yeah. I'm fine.

582
00:36:13.002 --> 00:36:15.357
-How are you?
-I'm good.

583
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.099
Off to work. then. or...?

584
00:36:18.182 --> 00:36:20.231
Uh-huh.

585
00:36:20.314 --> 00:36:21.798
I-I'm sorry. man.

586
00:36:21.881 --> 00:36:23.365
I know you're like.
"This fucking guy." right?

587
00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:24.496
No. no.

588
00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:26.150
No. it's all right. It's just...

589
00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:29.110
You know. we haven't had
a chance to catch up in a while.

590
00:36:29.193 --> 00:36:31.112
'cause. you know...

591
00:36:31.195 --> 00:36:33.897
all the shit. and. uh. yeah.

592
00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.117
Just wanted to check up on you.

593
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.075
Casey. I'm good. What's up?

594
00:36:38.158 --> 00:36:40.251
Nothing's up. man. I just...

595
00:36:40.334 --> 00:36:41.861
I know I wasn't always
the best babysitter

596
00:36:41.944 --> 00:36:43.863
back in the day. but. um...

597
00:36:43.946 --> 00:36:46.253
I do want you to be okay.

598
00:36:48.821 --> 00:36:51.610
You still up there with Don?

599
00:36:51.693 --> 00:36:52.785
Yep.

600
00:36:52.868 --> 00:36:55.005
Great. Well. uh...

601
00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:56.485
I think about you sometimes.

602
00:36:56.568 --> 00:36:59.440
Not... not in a weird way.
just... Yeah.

603
00:37:00.789 --> 00:37:02.317
I'm a different guy now...
I've grown up...

604
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.141
so if you ever need help
with anything. just...

605
00:37:06.142 --> 00:37:08.192
I'm good.

606
00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:10.325
I just gotta get to work. so...

607
00:37:10.408 --> 00:37:11.848
Maybe I'll stop by sometime.

608
00:37:11.931 --> 00:37:16.065
Yeah. I mean. I-I'm j...
I'm super busy right now.

609
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.333
-Crazy busy.
-Right.

610
00:37:18.416 --> 00:37:21.162
But. um.
yeah. maybe sometime later.

611
00:37:21.245 --> 00:37:23.947
Later. yeah. All right.

612
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.684
Cool. See ya.

613
00:37:26.685 --> 00:37:28.560
Take it easy.

614
00:37:28.643 --> 00:37:30.123
See ya. Teddy.

615
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.739
HOST 2 [over headphones]: Some
people say they're all demons.

616
00:37:33.822 --> 00:37:36.873
A lot of people think they're
higher-intelligent beings

617
00:37:36.956 --> 00:37:40.442
from a different wavelength.

618
00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:41.791
That's a possibility.
too. I guess.

619
00:37:41.874 --> 00:37:43.314
I-I don't know anything.

620
00:37:43.397 --> 00:37:45.273
So I'm not saying. like.
one way or the other.

621
00:37:45.356 --> 00:37:47.318
I just. personally.
I have my opinion.

622
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:49.277
and I think it's somehow
all connected.

623
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.017
HOST 1 [over headphones]:
I think that

624
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.456
all of those things
are each a small part of...

625
00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:55.805
How you doing?

626
00:37:55.888 --> 00:37:57.676
-What's up. man?
-Morning.

627
00:37:57.759 --> 00:37:59.809
HOST 2 [over headphones]:
I honestly start to believe

628
00:37:59.892 --> 00:38:01.724
that we're all in.
like. a simulation.

629
00:38:01.807 --> 00:38:04.295
And I don't want to say
it's like <i>The Matrix.</i> but...

630
00:38:09.162 --> 00:38:10.472
What's wrong. Tina?

631
00:38:10.555 --> 00:38:13.475
My frickin' hand
is still killing me.

632
00:38:13.558 --> 00:38:16.434
Christ. Did you file that shit
with OSHA yet?

633
00:38:16.517 --> 00:38:20.003
I looked into it. but I...

634
00:38:20.086 --> 00:38:22.832
I don't think it's a violation.

635
00:38:22.915 --> 00:38:26.183
Tina. their machinery cut you.

636
00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:28.316
and you get punished
for missing quotas?

637
00:38:28.399 --> 00:38:31.014
That's a... that's a violation.

638
00:38:31.097 --> 00:38:32.707
Fucking demons.

639
00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:36.798
I just don't want any trouble.

640
00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:42.504
Don't you worry.

641
00:38:42.587 --> 00:38:44.767
One day soon.
it's all gonna change.

642
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.679
They're not gonna get away
with this shit in the end. okay?

643
00:38:48.549 --> 00:38:50.076
I promise you that.

644
00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:51.730
On Monday afternoon.

645
00:38:51.813 --> 00:38:54.516
following what coworkers
describe as a routine workday.

646
00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:58.215
Auxolith Biomedical CEO
Michelle Fuller

647
00:38:58.298 --> 00:39:00.826
got into her car.
passed the security gate

648
00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:03.699
at Auxolith headquarters
in Fayette County. Georgia.

649
00:39:03.782 --> 00:39:05.570
and drove towards home.

650
00:39:05.653 --> 00:39:07.833
That was nearly 48 hours ago.

651
00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:10.096
No one has heard from her since.

652
00:39:10.179 --> 00:39:12.447
Authorities now believe
there is a strong chance...

653
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:13.839
Hey.

654
00:39:13.922 --> 00:39:15.232
Oh. yo. What up. Carlos?

655
00:39:15.315 --> 00:39:17.408
I brought some
fresh honey in for toast.

656
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:18.670
Oh. great.

657
00:39:18.753 --> 00:39:20.368
-Thank you. Teddy.
-Yeah.

658
00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:22.021
A furious statewide
manhunt is now underway.

659
00:39:22.104 --> 00:39:24.633
with state police urging
Fayette County locals

660
00:39:24.716 --> 00:39:28.114
to come forward with
any information at all.

661
00:39:28.197 --> 00:39:30.116
Given Fuller's wealth
and high profile.

662
00:39:30.199 --> 00:39:32.554
state police are not ruling out
the possibility

663
00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:35.121
that Fuller is being held
for ransom.

664
00:39:35.204 --> 00:39:37.689
though. as of yet.
there is no evidence

665
00:39:37.772 --> 00:39:39.474
to suggest this might be
the case.

666
00:39:39.557 --> 00:39:41.384
The only clue authorities...

667
00:40:17.246 --> 00:40:19.252
Hey. cuz. Did she eat?

668
00:40:19.335 --> 00:40:20.645
No.

669
00:40:20.728 --> 00:40:22.081
Bedpan?

670
00:40:22.164 --> 00:40:23.514
No.

671
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.612
Maybe she's too scared to go?

672
00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:32.614
No. she's not too scared to go.

673
00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:35.791
<i>It's trying to pity-trap
our asses.</i>

674
00:40:35.874 --> 00:40:37.706
<i>It's a ploy.</i>

675
00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:39.887
We're not gonna let it
pity-trap us. are we?

676
00:40:42.228 --> 00:40:43.451
No.

677
00:40:43.534 --> 00:40:44.887
Just stay over there.

678
00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.711
Okay. Teddy.

679
00:41:07.383 --> 00:41:10.826
MICHELLE [over recorder]: Um.
I am an alien from outer space.

680
00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:15.570
I live here on planet Earth.
but I am not a human being.

681
00:41:15.653 --> 00:41:18.790
My mother ship
is coming to Earth.

682
00:41:18.873 --> 00:41:21.663
and I would like to bring
my new friend with me.

683
00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:23.095
Thanks.

684
00:41:25.184 --> 00:41:26.494
Uh-huh.

685
00:41:26.577 --> 00:41:28.931
So...

686
00:41:29.014 --> 00:41:31.194
this is a joke. then?

687
00:41:31.277 --> 00:41:35.198
You're trying to simulate
sapient humor. or...

688
00:41:35.281 --> 00:41:37.287
That was the best I could do.

689
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.767
This is the best you could do?

690
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.948
You didn't even say it
in your own language.

691
00:41:42.114 --> 00:41:44.120
Sorry. that was the best
I could do.

692
00:41:44.203 --> 00:41:46.510
No. it isn't.

693
00:41:47.902 --> 00:41:50.692
What would you like me
to say. then?

694
00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:52.345
Well. I already did that.

695
00:41:52.428 --> 00:41:56.132
Um. I would like you
to request an audience

696
00:41:56.215 --> 00:41:59.091
with your emperor
to discuss the terms

697
00:41:59.174 --> 00:42:01.267
of your species' withdrawal
from Earth.

698
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:02.486
And I did that.

699
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:03.835
But convincingly.

700
00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:05.446
Well. that's gonna be difficult.

701
00:42:05.529 --> 00:42:06.878
Why?

702
00:42:08.183 --> 00:42:11.883
At the risk of repeating myself.
I'm not an alien.

703
00:42:18.977 --> 00:42:20.983
Teddy?

704
00:42:21.066 --> 00:42:22.637
What?

705
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.684
I thought all night
about our situation here.

706
00:42:26.767 --> 00:42:28.773
and I think I know
what's going on.

707
00:42:28.856 --> 00:42:31.210
Okay. Yeah. please.
enlighten me.

708
00:42:31.293 --> 00:42:33.822
So. look. I feel qualified here

709
00:42:33.905 --> 00:42:36.651
because I am a chemist
by training. but I also have

710
00:42:36.734 --> 00:42:38.261
-a psych degree.
-Oh.

711
00:42:38.344 --> 00:42:40.045
Okay. Wow. Great.

712
00:42:40.128 --> 00:42:41.656
A degree from a university?

713
00:42:41.739 --> 00:42:43.353
From a credentialist scam
for laundering privilege?

714
00:42:43.436 --> 00:42:44.441
Amazing.

715
00:42:44.524 --> 00:42:46.095
Well. yeah. I do have a degree.

716
00:42:46.178 --> 00:42:48.837
And I also have read
a lot about this.

717
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.318
You can't talk your way
out of this again.

718
00:42:52.401 --> 00:42:54.664
I'm not a kid anymore.

719
00:42:57.885 --> 00:43:01.458
I think you're in
a kind of echo chamber.

720
00:43:01.541 --> 00:43:03.591
-Echo chamber? Right now?
-Mm-hmm.

721
00:43:03.674 --> 00:43:05.371
Echo?

722
00:43:07.025 --> 00:43:10.293
Yeah. I read the same 5.000
think pieces about that. too.

723
00:43:10.376 --> 00:43:13.470
You're consuming content
on the Internet

724
00:43:13.553 --> 00:43:17.387
that is reinforcing
this sort of warped.

725
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.389
subjective idea of reality.

726
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:21.696
This is your best shot at me?

727
00:43:21.779 --> 00:43:24.655
Some "rabbit holes" bullshit
you read in <i>The Times?</i>

728
00:43:24.738 --> 00:43:26.309
Come on. Come on.

729
00:43:26.392 --> 00:43:28.267
Can we have a dialogue. please?

730
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.921
Don't call it a dialogue.

731
00:43:30.004 --> 00:43:31.532
This isn't <i>Death of a Salesman.</i>

732
00:43:31.615 --> 00:43:33.403
Okay. can we talk. please?

733
00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:35.057
Or are-are you just gonna
keep doing this?

734
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.624
-We don't need to talk.
-Yes. okay.

735
00:43:36.707 --> 00:43:38.669
Because I know exactly
what you're going to say.

736
00:43:38.752 --> 00:43:41.106
You're going to say
that I'm in some kind of

737
00:43:41.189 --> 00:43:44.893
Internet-induced autohypnotic
feedback loop.

738
00:43:44.976 --> 00:43:47.156
and-and gatekeepers.
and-and norms.

739
00:43:47.239 --> 00:43:49.550
and all that weak
hegemonic horseshit.

740
00:43:49.633 --> 00:43:52.161
But that is precisely
the limp-dick rhetoric

741
00:43:52.244 --> 00:43:53.554
that you've been instructed

742
00:43:53.637 --> 00:43:55.468
to counter the human
insurgency with.

743
00:43:55.551 --> 00:43:58.341
That's the fucking
hyper-normalized dialectic

744
00:43:58.424 --> 00:44:00.778
by which you've convinced
seven and a half billion people

745
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:02.606
that they're not your captives.

746
00:44:02.689 --> 00:44:07.306
To keep us believing in these
fucking false institutional.

747
00:44:07.389 --> 00:44:10.571
fucking "shy-boleths."

748
00:44:10.654 --> 00:44:12.398
You mean shibboleths.

749
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:14.052
That's what I said.

750
00:44:14.135 --> 00:44:15.837
-You said...
-Yeah. whatever.

751
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.621
Sorry.

752
00:44:17.704 --> 00:44:20.058
I guess grammar is a false
Andromedan construct as well.

753
00:44:20.141 --> 00:44:22.100
Hmm?

754
00:44:28.062 --> 00:44:29.716
Fucking...

755
00:44:39.204 --> 00:44:40.684
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.604
You're angry.

757
00:44:43.687 --> 00:44:45.823
I see that.

758
00:44:45.906 --> 00:44:48.043
I-I even think you have
a right to be angry.

759
00:44:48.126 --> 00:44:49.348
-You do?
-Yes.

760
00:44:49.431 --> 00:44:52.395
But we need to have
an honest talk

761
00:44:52.478 --> 00:44:55.659
in good faith about
what is going on here.

762
00:44:55.742 --> 00:44:57.748
Yes. you're right.
Let's-let's-let's talk it out.

763
00:44:57.831 --> 00:44:59.010
Let's create a safe space.

764
00:44:59.093 --> 00:45:01.752
safe words. good faith. dialogue.

765
00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:04.146
We need to talk about this.
we need to talk about that.

766
00:45:04.229 --> 00:45:06.061
and what we talk about
when we talk about

767
00:45:06.144 --> 00:45:07.715
fucking talk. talk. talk. talk.

768
00:45:07.798 --> 00:45:09.020
talk. talk. talk. talk.
talking forever

769
00:45:09.103 --> 00:45:11.240
until we're all fucking dead.

770
00:45:11.323 --> 00:45:12.589
Yeah. I agree.

771
00:45:12.672 --> 00:45:15.592
So. what is this exactly
that you want?

772
00:45:15.675 --> 00:45:16.941
Like. what do you really want?

773
00:45:17.024 --> 00:45:18.460
Is it money?

774
00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.816
Your capital has no value to us.

775
00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:24.427
So. what is it then.
a power thing?

776
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.033
A sex thing?

777
00:45:28.427 --> 00:45:30.738
We have no interest
in you sexually.

778
00:45:30.821 --> 00:45:35.525
Irrespective of the fact that
your reproductive organs

779
00:45:35.608 --> 00:45:37.179
may not be compatible with ours.

780
00:45:37.262 --> 00:45:39.830
my cousin and I have also
been chemically castrated.

781
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:43.707
Oh. Jesus Christ. Okay.

782
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.231
But I figured you might
try to lure us in that way.

783
00:45:46.314 --> 00:45:48.316
hence the precaution.
See. Don?

784
00:45:53.539 --> 00:45:54.762
Don.

785
00:45:54.845 --> 00:45:56.194
Teddy.

786
00:45:57.195 --> 00:45:58.548
Come on.

787
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.332
We have options here.

788
00:46:00.415 --> 00:46:01.769
-No.
-We do.

789
00:46:01.852 --> 00:46:03.031
There are no options.

790
00:46:03.114 --> 00:46:05.337
There are no rules.

791
00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.209
There are no deals.

792
00:46:07.292 --> 00:46:08.645
There's no payoff.

793
00:46:08.728 --> 00:46:10.212
There's no money.

794
00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:12.910
There is no legal system.

795
00:46:12.993 --> 00:46:14.346
There's no Congress.

796
00:46:14.429 --> 00:46:16.131
There is no America.

797
00:46:16.214 --> 00:46:19.830
There's no global
democratic order. okay?

798
00:46:19.913 --> 00:46:21.702
So don't talk to me
like I'm a dipshit.

799
00:46:21.785 --> 00:46:23.704
because I'm not a dipshit.

800
00:46:23.787 --> 00:46:25.575
I'm a guy that knows
what the fuck is happening.

801
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:29.662
and you will not defeat me.
you sick Andromedan fuck!

802
00:46:32.317 --> 00:46:34.101
Teddy. I'm sorry.

803
00:46:35.146 --> 00:46:36.800
You need help.

804
00:46:38.062 --> 00:46:40.064
You're mentally ill.

805
00:46:49.943 --> 00:46:53.168
Everybody denies it at first...

806
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:55.208
and then they confess.

807
00:47:12.923 --> 00:47:15.407
Fucking...

808
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:19.237
Fucking fuck! Fucking lie!

809
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.843
Fuck!

810
00:47:24.282 --> 00:47:26.065
Fuck!

811
00:48:11.982 --> 00:48:14.989
<i>I didn't
discover them on my own.</i>

812
00:48:15.072 --> 00:48:17.556
<i>I stand on the shoulders
of giants.</i>

813
00:48:17.639 --> 00:48:20.168
<i>The PA-99-N2 microlensing event</i>

814
00:48:20.251 --> 00:48:22.779
<i>proved that there was
an exoplanet.</i>

815
00:48:22.862 --> 00:48:26.435
<i>And Gideon55's YouTube studies
into Andromedan infiltration</i>

816
00:48:26.518 --> 00:48:28.916
<i>paved the way
for my own research.</i>

817
00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:31.266
<i>But I was the one who discovered</i>

818
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:33.355
<i>how to identify them. okay?</i>

819
00:48:33.438 --> 00:48:35.487
<i>I created that content.</i>

820
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.576
<i>Obviously. I've never been
on the ship before.</i>

821
00:48:37.659 --> 00:48:41.058
<i>but I know enough
to render it on my laptop.</i>

822
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:44.496
<i>The journey there
will be instantaneous.</i>

823
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:46.498
<i>But once we're on board.</i>

824
00:48:46.581 --> 00:48:48.152
<i>inside their chemical
atmosphere.</i>

825
00:48:48.235 --> 00:48:49.850
<i>they may be able
to hear our thoughts.</i>

826
00:48:49.933 --> 00:48:53.114
<i>so keep your mind clear
and decisive</i>

827
00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:56.073
<i>during the negotiations.</i>

828
00:48:56.156 --> 00:49:02.036
<i>They will see that we are
men of honor and dignity</i>

829
00:49:02.119 --> 00:49:06.823
<i>and that Earth. with its vast
resources and human ingenuity.</i>

830
00:49:06.906 --> 00:49:09.217
has much that we can offer.

831
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:14.396
So much more than this fucking
worthless death spiral

832
00:49:14.479 --> 00:49:16.093
into chaos and shit.

833
00:49:16.176 --> 00:49:19.227
And if they won't listen
to reason.

834
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.095
well. I have a plan
for that. too.

835
00:49:24.793 --> 00:49:27.709
What will our lives
be like in space?

836
00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:31.017
In space?

837
00:49:32.105 --> 00:49:34.542
Aren't we going
to live in space?

838
00:49:36.501 --> 00:49:38.855
Well. bud. uh...

839
00:49:38.938 --> 00:49:40.813
we'll only be gone
for a few hours.

840
00:49:40.896 --> 00:49:42.511
We're not leaving Earth
for good.

841
00:49:42.594 --> 00:49:44.948
We're saving it.

842
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:47.908
So we have to stay here?

843
00:49:47.991 --> 00:49:50.562
Well. yeah. Of course.

844
00:49:50.645 --> 00:49:52.260
But we're saving it.

845
00:49:52.343 --> 00:49:55.263
so it'll be a good place
to live again.

846
00:49:55.346 --> 00:49:58.523
So. everything will be okay.

847
00:50:00.481 --> 00:50:02.966
Yeah. I know.

848
00:50:03.049 --> 00:50:04.707
Sorry.

849
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.097
It's okay. man.

850
00:50:12.363 --> 00:50:15.322
Ever since those shots
you gave me...

851
00:50:16.367 --> 00:50:18.286
...I've felt weird

852
00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:20.418
and crazy

853
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:23.682
and sometimes sad.

854
00:50:23.765 --> 00:50:25.941
Have you felt that way. too?

855
00:50:26.942 --> 00:50:28.949
It'll pass. Don't worry.

856
00:50:29.032 --> 00:50:30.685
Ah.

857
00:50:32.513 --> 00:50:33.775
It'll pass.

858
00:51:31.442 --> 00:51:32.882
Good morning.

859
00:51:32.965 --> 00:51:34.797
You're out of breath.

860
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.451
Oh. yes.

861
00:51:36.534 --> 00:51:38.061
You. um...

862
00:51:38.144 --> 00:51:40.103
you make me nervous.

863
00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:47.592
Um. so. I've-I've been
doing a lot of pondering.

864
00:51:47.675 --> 00:51:51.288
and I think
we should start over.

865
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.247
I want to help you.

866
00:51:55.292 --> 00:51:57.428
And given that.

867
00:51:57.511 --> 00:52:00.475
there is something that I
should have said to you earlier

868
00:52:00.558 --> 00:52:04.218
that I am finally prepared
to say to you now

869
00:52:04.301 --> 00:52:06.433
with conviction.

870
00:52:07.956 --> 00:52:09.784
I am an alien.

871
00:52:13.658 --> 00:52:15.050
I admit it.

872
00:52:16.051 --> 00:52:17.448
You were right all along.

873
00:52:17.531 --> 00:52:20.060
I am an alien.

874
00:52:20.143 --> 00:52:22.366
I mean. you can't blame me
for trying to conceal it

875
00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:24.281
for as long as I did. I...

876
00:52:24.364 --> 00:52:25.674
Part of my mission here on Earth

877
00:52:25.757 --> 00:52:28.325
is to blend in
and so forth. so...

878
00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:32.942
Look. I'm very tired.

879
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:35.858
And I know that this doesn't...

880
00:52:35.941 --> 00:52:38.469
sound as forceful

881
00:52:38.552 --> 00:52:40.863
or the verisimilitude is not

882
00:52:40.946 --> 00:52:42.778
what you would want it to be.
necessarily.

883
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:46.129
but I can assure you
I mean what I say.

884
00:52:46.212 --> 00:52:49.650
And I would like to move
forward now to a solution.

885
00:52:53.524 --> 00:52:55.221
I'm an alien.

886
00:53:15.546 --> 00:53:17.417
You want to start over?

887
00:53:18.723 --> 00:53:21.033
Yes.

888
00:53:21.116 --> 00:53:22.644

Let's start over.

890
00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:30.391
I was hoping
we could agree on your genus

891
00:53:30.474 --> 00:53:33.133
and avoid a painful test.
but you forced my hand.

892
00:53:33.216 --> 00:53:34.917
I-I admitted it.

893
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.571
Okay?

894
00:53:36.654 --> 00:53:38.964
-I admitted it.
-I'm sorry.

895
00:53:39.047 --> 00:53:42.312
I'm a humane person.
I-I do not want to do this.

896
00:53:43.661 --> 00:53:45.667
I'm an alien.

897
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.582
I am an alien!

898
00:53:47.665 --> 00:53:49.366
-I am...
-I agree.

She already admitted it.

905
00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:09.560

906
00:54:09.643 --> 00:54:11.214
Yeah. but...

907
00:54:11.297 --> 00:54:13.129

943
00:56:35.572 --> 00:56:38.052
apologize profusely.

944
00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:43.710
I did not realize...

945
00:56:44.755 --> 00:56:46.195
...Your Majesty.

946
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:48.110
-What?
-I stupidly thought

947
00:56:48.193 --> 00:56:50.108
you were admin.

948
00:56:51.544 --> 00:56:55.635
I did not realize.
at that voltage...

949
00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:59.469
...you have the royal
genetic code.

950
00:56:59.552 --> 00:57:01.558
I'm sorry.

951
00:57:01.641 --> 00:57:02.990
I didn't know.

952
00:57:04.078 --> 00:57:05.689
I didn't know.

953
00:57:10.389 --> 00:57:12.787
The most important thing I want
to stress to you right now

954
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.050
is I never want
to put this behind us.

955
00:57:15.133 --> 00:57:16.264
Never.

956
00:57:17.396 --> 00:57:19.707
What happened is part
of all of us now.

957
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.056
And it doesn't go away.

958
00:57:21.139 --> 00:57:22.840
and it doesn't get swept
under the rug.

959
00:57:22.923 --> 00:57:24.233
and it doesn't get excused.

960
00:57:24.316 --> 00:57:25.887
Not on my watch.

961
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:27.928
This one sticks. Forever.

962
00:57:28.581 --> 00:57:30.457
I am putting this up

963
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.676
on the corporate masthead
for all to see.

964
00:57:32.759 --> 00:57:37.068
For everyone in our company
and our industry to learn from.

965
00:57:38.025 --> 00:57:39.335
That's why I'm meeting

966
00:57:39.418 --> 00:57:40.684
all of the victims' families
this week.

967
00:57:40.767 --> 00:57:43.252
To let them know
we are going to do better.

968
00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:44.601
Maybe we don't even
try to market

969
00:57:44.684 --> 00:57:46.386
a product like this anymore.

970
00:57:46.469 --> 00:57:50.041
Or maybe. maybe we take
this experience to grow

971
00:57:50.124 --> 00:57:51.826
and to get this formula right.

972
00:57:51.909 --> 00:57:54.959
Because I really do think.
if done correctly and safely.

973
00:57:55.042 --> 00:57:57.527
this could be a product
that could help someone

974
00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:59.094
like your mom.

975
00:57:59.177 --> 00:58:01.792
But right now. we would like
to do what's right

976
00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:04.055
and cover the expenses
for your mother's treatment

977
00:58:04.138 --> 00:58:07.276
in hopes that her condition
might one day improve.

978
00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:10.148
We will not tolerate the idea
of you or your family

979
00:58:10.231 --> 00:58:11.976
bearing the financial burden
of this.

980
00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:14.326
We are covering all of it.

981
00:58:14.409 --> 00:58:16.067
This one's on us.

982
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.501
And. again. we're just so sorry.

983
00:59:07.027 --> 00:59:08.337
You'll have to excuse me.

984
00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.341
It's my best attempt
to approximate

985
00:59:12.424 --> 00:59:15.779
the royal treatment
to which you are accustomed.

986
00:59:15.862 --> 00:59:18.521
<i>Oh. it's great. Thank you.</i>

987
00:59:18.604 --> 00:59:20.871
<i>There was a wig in the bathroom.</i>

988
00:59:20.954 --> 00:59:22.264
<i>Did you want me to wear that?</i>

989
00:59:22.347 --> 00:59:23.657
<i>No. no. It's just an option.</i>

990
00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:24.875
<i>I'm fine.</i>

991
00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:26.660
<i>And I want to apologize</i>

992
00:59:26.743 --> 00:59:29.793
<i>for not approaching you
with proper courtesy.</i>

993
00:59:29.876 --> 00:59:32.230
<i>Not realizing. of course.
what you were.</i>

994
00:59:32.313 --> 00:59:35.103
<i>That you shared blood
with the emperor himself.</i>

995
00:59:35.186 --> 00:59:37.322
<i>Oh. that's perfectly all right.</i>

996
00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:40.804
<i>The truth is. we will
never make progress here</i>

997
00:59:40.887 --> 00:59:43.807
<i>if we can't speak
eyeball to eyeball</i>

998
00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:46.506
<i>as the most evolved examples
of our respective species.</i>

999
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:48.159
<i>I agree.</i>

1000
00:59:48.242 --> 00:59:49.635
<i>-Good.
-Excellent.</i>

1001
00:59:53.596 --> 00:59:57.251
Well. on that note. enjoy.

1002
01:00:06.826 --> 01:00:08.219
It's a lovely home.

1003
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.269
Thank you.

1004
01:00:11.352 --> 01:00:13.228
Mmm.

1005
01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:14.621
Just you here?

1006
01:00:14.704 --> 01:00:16.710
Yes.

1007
01:00:16.793 --> 01:00:18.446
Always?

1008
01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:20.757
Sorry?

1009
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.151
Has-has it always just been you?

1010
01:00:23.234 --> 01:00:25.762
Um. well...

1011
01:00:25.845 --> 01:00:29.853
I'd prefer if we didn't delve
too deeply into the personal.

1012
01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:31.289
if you don't mind.

1013
01:00:31.372 --> 01:00:32.682
Mmm.

1014
01:00:32.765 --> 01:00:34.379
Sure. that's fine.

1015
01:00:34.462 --> 01:00:36.029
Thank you.

1016
01:00:39.642 --> 01:00:41.212
So. what...

1017
01:00:41.295 --> 01:00:44.128
Why don't you tell me more
about your movement?

1018
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:45.782
My what?

1019
01:00:45.865 --> 01:00:47.954
Your movement.
What you're doing.

1020
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:54.051
Respectfully.
we are not a movement.

1021
01:00:54.134 --> 01:00:55.531
Oh.

1022
01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:58.186
A movement is made up
of many people.

1023
01:00:58.269 --> 01:01:00.010
I did this all on my own.

1024
01:01:01.054 --> 01:01:02.364
Of course.

1025
01:01:02.447 --> 01:01:05.062
With the help of my colleague.
of course.

1026
01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:06.368
Well. it's very impressive.

1027
01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:07.630
-Thank you.
-I'm...

1028
01:01:07.713 --> 01:01:11.242
I'm all for people
who can do that.

1029
01:01:11.325 --> 01:01:14.807
You know. the activism thing.

1030
01:01:16.766 --> 01:01:19.642
99.9% of what's called activism

1031
01:01:19.725 --> 01:01:22.166
is really personal exhibitionism

1032
01:01:22.249 --> 01:01:25.561
and brand maintenance
in disguise.

1033
01:01:25.644 --> 01:01:27.607
Mmm. Okay.

1034
01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:29.692
I used to be the same way.

1035
01:01:31.302 --> 01:01:35.397
I ran through the whole
digestive tract in...

1036
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.399
five years?

1037
01:01:37.482 --> 01:01:42.012
Alt-right. alt-lite.
leftist. Marxist.

1038
01:01:42.095 --> 01:01:44.536
All those stupid badges.

1039
01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:47.883
I went shopping hungry. and I
just bought the whole store.

1040
01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:51.326
Mmm.

1041
01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:53.981
But I was just looking
in the wrong places.

1042
01:01:54.064 --> 01:01:57.767
Until I discovered you.

1043
01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.422
Well. again.
it is very impressive.

1044
01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:02.855
Thank you.

1045
01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:06.167
You as well. Don.

1046
01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.169
-Um...
-You'll...

1047
01:02:08.252 --> 01:02:09.649
You'll have to excuse
my colleague.

1048
01:02:09.732 --> 01:02:11.520
He prefers not to converse.

1049
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:14.088
Uh. can I go to the bathroom?

1050
01:02:14.171 --> 01:02:16.394
In just a minute. Don.

1051
01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:18.349
We're eating right now.

1052
01:02:23.136 --> 01:02:25.099
I see you're apiarists.

1053
01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:26.622
Of sorts.

1054
01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:28.058
I've taken an interest as well.

1055
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:30.191
Hmm. So I've heard.

1056
01:02:30.274 --> 01:02:32.367
Magnificent
creatures. honeybees.

1057
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:33.803
Very much so.

1058
01:02:33.886 --> 01:02:36.806
Earth's most admirable creation.

1059
01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:40.414
Well. shit. I've literally said
those exact words before.

1060
01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:49.684
Right. so. um. what is it
that you admire about them?

1061
01:02:51.948 --> 01:02:54.080
About bees? Uh...

1062
01:02:55.429 --> 01:02:56.870
Complex society.

1063
01:02:56.953 --> 01:02:58.436
Work ethic.

1064
01:02:58.519 --> 01:03:00.134
They do their duty.
they build their worlds

1065
01:03:00.217 --> 01:03:04.787
without complaint or piety
or self-obsession.

1066
01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:08.620
Mm-hmm.

1067
01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:10.140
All true.

1068
01:03:13.012 --> 01:03:17.891
Which is why they're so easy
to exploit. right?

1069
01:03:17.974 --> 01:03:20.763
I just admire their resolve.
That's all.

1070
01:03:20.846 --> 01:03:22.805
Even in the face of peril.

1071
01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:25.590
Well. we can agree on that.

1072
01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.080
What sort of peril. by the way?

1073
01:03:33.163 --> 01:03:34.472
Sorry?

1074
01:03:34.555 --> 01:03:36.997
You said bees have faced peril.

1075
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.646
Such as?

1076
01:03:39.952 --> 01:03:41.523
Uh. what do you want me to say?

1077
01:03:41.606 --> 01:03:44.178
Well. just say it.

1078
01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:46.528
-Why don't you say it?
-Nah. you should just say it.

1079
01:03:46.611 --> 01:03:48.095
You go ahead.

1080
01:03:48.178 --> 01:03:49.487
No. I insist.

1081
01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:52.443
No. please. After you.

1082
01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:57.100
Colony collapse disorder.

1083
01:04:02.888 --> 01:04:05.242
Sure. Teddy. Like CCD.

1084
01:04:05.325 --> 01:04:07.549
You're a bit of an expert
on CCD.

1085
01:04:07.632 --> 01:04:10.247
Well. I... I wouldn't
say that exactly.

1086
01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.985
Well. I would say that exactly.

1087
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.471
It's all right.
We're just talking.

1088
01:04:16.554 --> 01:04:19.779
So. I take it you're referring
to the neonicotinoids

1089
01:04:19.862 --> 01:04:22.085
that my company makes.

1090
01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:24.000
You know what? Let's just...
let's just leave it.

1091
01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:26.524
No. I-I appreciate your concern.

1092
01:04:26.607 --> 01:04:30.354
I just think your research
is a bit out of date. Teddy.

1093
01:04:30.437 --> 01:04:33.053
Uh. CCD has declined
significantly in recent years.

1094
01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:35.185
The bees are coming back.

1095
01:04:35.268 --> 01:04:37.144
And there's no consensus

1096
01:04:37.227 --> 01:04:41.322
that pesticides were ever
a real threat to begin with.

1097
01:04:41.405 --> 01:04:45.587
Yes. I'm well aware of what
you've all been telling us.

1098
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.807
Thank you.

1099
01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:53.116
I know you want there
to be a master plan. Teddy.

1100
01:04:53.199 --> 01:04:57.555
You want the bees to be dying
so that it can be my fault

1101
01:04:57.638 --> 01:04:59.688
and you don't have to think
about the real reasons

1102
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.164
why species die.

1103
01:05:02.295 --> 01:05:05.694
Immunodeficiencies.
changing habitats.

1104
01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.305
genetic factors.

1105
01:05:08.388 --> 01:05:11.173
Or sometimes a species
just winds down.

1106
01:05:12.436 --> 01:05:14.094
"Winds down"?

1107
01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:16.923
Maybe something clicks
in their heads

1108
01:05:17.006 --> 01:05:20.357
and they just know
or they intuit.

1109
01:05:21.532 --> 01:05:25.057
The futility of
the entire enterprise.

1110
01:05:26.102 --> 01:05:28.238
Who knows. right?

1111
01:05:28.321 --> 01:05:30.197
Right. Who knows?

1112
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.412
-That's right.
-So hard to say.

1113
01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:35.938
Who knows. Don?

1114
01:05:40.072 --> 01:05:42.165
We were having a nice dinner.

1115
01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:43.427
We were.

1116
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:47.036
Nice. quiet. respectful.

1117
01:05:48.037 --> 01:05:49.912
But now we're not.

1118
01:05:49.995 --> 01:05:51.131
No. we're not.

1119
01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:53.825
And why do suppose that is?

1120
01:05:55.522 --> 01:05:57.050
You tell me.

1121
01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:58.834
Because you're lying to me.

1122
01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.444
Are you sure
I can't use the bathr...

1123
01:06:00.527 --> 01:06:02.490
Shh!

1124
01:06:02.573 --> 01:06:04.662
Your usual conclusion.

1125
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.278
You're murdering the bees.

1126
01:06:08.361 --> 01:06:09.410
I am not.

1127
01:06:09.493 --> 01:06:12.065
And now you're lying again.

1128
01:06:12.148 --> 01:06:13.414
-Lies.
-Lies.

1129
01:06:13.497 --> 01:06:15.807
-Truth.
-Lies.

1130
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.158
What's the difference?

1131
01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:19.550
I can't change your mind.

1132
01:06:19.633 --> 01:06:21.509
You're right. you can't.

1133
01:06:21.592 --> 01:06:24.425
Because I know who you are.

1134
01:06:24.508 --> 01:06:26.379
I know what you are.

1135
01:06:27.946 --> 01:06:30.731
I know you. too. Teddy.

1136
01:06:32.168 --> 01:06:34.174
Bullshit you do.

1137
01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.480
I do.

1138
01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:38.004
You know how I know?

1139
01:06:38.087 --> 01:06:39.610
Fuck you.

1140
01:06:41.525 --> 01:06:43.657
Sandy Gatz.

1141
01:06:46.443 --> 01:06:48.532
What did you say?

1142
01:06:50.186 --> 01:06:52.057
I remember. Teddy.

1143
01:06:53.493 --> 01:06:55.974
That was your mother. Right?

1144
01:06:57.671 --> 01:06:59.155
She is my mother.

1145
01:06:59.238 --> 01:07:00.765
Right. yes. Of course.

1146
01:07:00.848 --> 01:07:03.029
I'm sorry.

1147
01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:05.596
And you will never
say her name again.

1148
01:07:05.679 --> 01:07:06.989
Understand?

1149
01:07:07.072 --> 01:07:08.726
That's fair enough.

1150
01:07:09.857 --> 01:07:11.994
But I do think
we need to discuss...

1151
01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:13.387
W-We actually do not

1152
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:15.650
because this is not about that.

1153
01:07:15.733 --> 01:07:17.608
With all due respect. Teddy.

1154
01:07:17.691 --> 01:07:19.915
how could this
not be about that?

1155
01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:21.961
We believed
we were helping. Teddy.

1156
01:07:22.044 --> 01:07:23.614
Don't you dare.

1157
01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:26.313
Opioid withdrawal
medication like that

1158
01:07:26.396 --> 01:07:28.054
could've helped your mother

1159
01:07:28.137 --> 01:07:30.404
-and millions like her.
-Stop. Just stop.

1160
01:07:30.487 --> 01:07:33.755
And the clinical trial pay.
that was helping her. too.

1161
01:07:33.838 --> 01:07:36.192
I know it wasn't
a king's ransom. but it...

1162
01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:37.977
Stop right now.

1163
01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.023
Obviously. we did not foresee
the complications

1164
01:07:41.106 --> 01:07:42.982
for Sandy or for the others.

1165
01:07:43.065 --> 01:07:44.157
Do not say her name.

1166
01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.897
You do not say her name.

1167
01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.683
We believed we paid your family
a proper reparation.

1168
01:07:48.766 --> 01:07:50.990
but now I see
it wasn't nearly enough.

1169
01:07:51.073 --> 01:07:52.513
-Stop!
-Not by half.

1170
01:07:52.596 --> 01:07:53.775
not by a fraction.

1171
01:07:53.858 --> 01:07:55.168
-Stop!
-Teddy...

1172
01:07:55.251 --> 01:07:57.126
you're right to distrust me.
you are.

1173
01:07:57.209 --> 01:07:59.520
-I lost myself somewhere. okay?
-Fuck you.

1174
01:07:59.603 --> 01:08:01.087
-Shut the fuck up.
-I...

1175
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:03.306
I became a human being

1176
01:08:03.389 --> 01:08:04.786
that I told myself
I would never become.

1177
01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:06.657
-Fuck you!
-I'm not denying that.

1178
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.224
but I can help you. Teddy.

1179
01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:09.878
I can still help you.

1180
01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:11.706
And I can still help
your mother.

1181
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:13.403
I can help her.

1182
01:08:13.486 --> 01:08:14.665
Truly. I can.

1183
01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:16.841
I-I... I mean.

1184
01:08:16.924 --> 01:08:19.013
can you?

1185
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.407
You needed a mother.

1186
01:08:22.495 --> 01:08:23.674
She was never there for you.

1187
01:08:23.757 --> 01:08:25.018
Fucking die. you fucker!

1188
01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.031
Fucking kill you!

1189
01:08:32.114 --> 01:08:33.854
I'll fucking kill you!

1190
01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:40.121
Teddy. stop.

1191
01:08:46.737 --> 01:08:48.260
Teddy. stop.

1192
01:09:44.708 --> 01:09:46.105
Get off him!

1193
01:09:46.188 --> 01:09:47.758
You can't beat me.
because you are a loser

1194
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:49.282
and I am a winner.

1195
01:09:49.365 --> 01:09:50.931
And that's fucking life.

1196
01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.526
-Hey.
-Hey.

1197
01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:00.962
How annoying is this. right?

1198
01:11:01.045 --> 01:11:02.485
-No. what's up?
-Mmm.

1199
01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:03.965
No. come on. dude. I know.

1200
01:11:04.048 --> 01:11:05.358
It's like.
"Why'd I even tell this guy

1201
01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:07.098
"he could stop by." right?

1202
01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:08.622
It's fine. Casey. What's up?

1203
01:11:08.705 --> 01:11:10.406
Um. sorry.

1204
01:11:10.489 --> 01:11:12.582
I-I actually do have a real
reason to be here. though.

1205
01:11:12.665 --> 01:11:14.149
Uh-huh.

1206
01:11:14.232 --> 01:11:16.282
Um. well. you know how
we're all working

1207
01:11:16.365 --> 01:11:18.149
this missing persons thing?

1208
01:11:19.716 --> 01:11:21.287
Uh. yeah.

1209
01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:23.955
I just had a couple questions
to run by you. actually.

1210
01:11:24.503 --> 01:11:25.595
Don't worry.

1211
01:11:25.678 --> 01:11:27.684
Obviously. I just. um...

1212
01:11:27.767 --> 01:11:30.509
Sorry. could I actually
come in. maybe?

1213
01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:32.820
Uh. yeah. No. sure.

1214
01:11:32.903 --> 01:11:34.430
Come on in.

1215
01:11:34.513 --> 01:11:36.513
Dude. thank you.
I really appreciate that.

1216
01:11:43.305 --> 01:11:44.745
We are not alone.

1217
01:11:44.828 --> 01:11:46.268
Huh?

1218
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:48.575
Nothing. Just. you know.

1219
01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:50.229
"We are not alone."

1220
01:11:50.312 --> 01:11:51.578
Oh. right.

1221
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:53.232
Well. we're not.

1222
01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:54.624
-Uh...
-Right.

1223
01:11:54.707 --> 01:11:56.583
You want some water or...

1224
01:11:56.666 --> 01:11:59.145
That'd be great. Thank you.

1225
01:12:00.539 --> 01:12:02.632
Gotta tell you. man. it's. uh.

1226
01:12:02.715 --> 01:12:04.804
pretty weird being back in here.

1227
01:12:05.979 --> 01:12:07.764
A lot of feelings.

1228
01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.644
Yeah. well. same old shit.

1229
01:12:14.727 --> 01:12:16.037
Hmm.

1230
01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.952
Thank you.

1231
01:12:18.035 --> 01:12:20.650
Scared the. uh.
chair's gonna run away?

1232
01:12:20.733 --> 01:12:22.344
What?

1233
01:12:24.998 --> 01:12:27.527
Oh. No.

1234
01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.660
My mom. she used to have
fits or whatever.

1235
01:12:30.743 --> 01:12:32.658
so we'd-we'd nail
the chair down.

1236
01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:35.357
Yeah.

1237
01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.668
Uh-oh.

1238
01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:40.540
What?

1239
01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.494
My archnemesis.

1240
01:12:44.409 --> 01:12:46.197
Ah.

1241
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.504
You want a piece of cake?

1242
01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:50.762
I mean. if you insist.

1243
01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:55.201
Yeah. I love this stuff.

1244
01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.476
So. um. you had
some questions or...?

1245
01:13:03.559 --> 01:13:05.739
Oh. Uh. yeah. sorry.

1246
01:13:05.822 --> 01:13:07.567
Um. you're still
at Auxolith. right?

1247
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.090
Yeah.

1248
01:13:09.173 --> 01:13:11.701
So you must know all about
the Fuller case?

1249
01:13:11.784 --> 01:13:14.313
I mean. I heard a little. yeah.

1250
01:13:14.396 --> 01:13:15.836
On the news?

1251
01:13:15.919 --> 01:13:18.012
I don't get the news
from the news.

1252
01:13:18.095 --> 01:13:19.709
Right. Um. of course. Sorry.

1253
01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:21.276
I'm just here on a hunch. really.

1254
01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:23.191
See. this missing lady.
her phone

1255
01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.367
pinged a cell tower in the area
the night of the abduction.

1256
01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:26.716
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1257
01:13:26.799 --> 01:13:28.327
Oh.

1258
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.851
Well. those things have
a pretty wide radius.

1259
01:13:30.934 --> 01:13:33.244
-though. right?
-Yeah. no. for sure.

1260
01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:36.160
It's just that her car was
also snapped by a speed trap

1261
01:13:36.243 --> 01:13:38.859
near the intersection
down the road over here.

1262
01:13:38.942 --> 01:13:40.291
Oh. yeah?

1263
01:13:41.335 --> 01:13:42.906
I know. I'm. uh...

1264
01:13:42.989 --> 01:13:44.604
You know. long shot. right?

1265
01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.954
But. I don't know.
it's a sparsely populated area.

1266
01:13:47.037 --> 01:13:48.825
Figured I'd check in
with the local residents.

1267
01:13:48.908 --> 01:13:52.912
See if. uh. you or Don
seen anything peculiar.

1268
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:55.266
Uh...

1269
01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:57.312
No. no.

1270
01:13:57.395 --> 01:13:58.835
Well. uh. hmm.

1271
01:13:58.918 --> 01:14:00.750
Let's see here.

1272
01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:04.271
For starters. have you seen...

1273
01:14:05.664 --> 01:14:07.931
...this car?

1274
01:14:08.014 --> 01:14:09.585
Uh-uh.

1275
01:14:09.668 --> 01:14:13.367
What about. uh. this woman?

1276
01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.201
I mean. yeah.
she-she owns my work. yeah.

1277
01:14:17.284 --> 01:14:18.768
But I haven't seen her. no.

1278
01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:20.204
You haven't seen her in person?

1279
01:14:20.287 --> 01:14:21.336
No.

1280
01:14:21.419 --> 01:14:24.383
I scan packages. so I wouldn't.

1281
01:14:24.466 --> 01:14:26.254
No. no. Dude. I-I know.
I'm-I'm sorry.

1282
01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:28.169
Um. how about your neighbors?

1283
01:14:28.252 --> 01:14:30.040
They say anything about.
I don't know.

1284
01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:32.869
any out-of-the-ordinary
activity?

1285
01:14:32.952 --> 01:14:35.477
Uh. I mean.
I don't know them. really.

1286
01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:38.353
Right. I-I'm sorry. man.

1287
01:14:38.436 --> 01:14:41.570
Uh. I'm really grasping
at straws here.

1288
01:14:42.962 --> 01:14:44.751
Uh...

1289
01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:48.145
Look. I mainly just wanted
to check up on you. man.

1290
01:14:48.228 --> 01:14:49.930
I know the last thing you want

1291
01:14:50.013 --> 01:14:52.715
is for your fucked-up
babysitter from 20 years ago

1292
01:14:52.798 --> 01:14:57.285
stopping by.
feeling guilty about. um...

1293
01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:01.028
you know. whatever
went down. uh. but...

1294
01:15:01.111 --> 01:15:02.769
Sometimes I pass by this place.

1295
01:15:02.852 --> 01:15:08.165
and I just get this fucking
sad. awful feeling. like.

1296
01:15:08.248 --> 01:15:10.207
"What's going on in there?"

1297
01:15:11.643 --> 01:15:13.170
You know?

1298
01:15:13.253 --> 01:15:14.906
Not much.

1299
01:15:26.092 --> 01:15:27.484
Where is he?

1300
01:15:38.322 --> 01:15:39.327
Don?

1301
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.025
Look at me. Don.

1302
01:15:42.108 --> 01:15:43.592
Put the gun down.

1303
01:15:43.675 --> 01:15:45.072
Look at me.

1304
01:15:45.155 --> 01:15:47.418
I know you would never hurt me.

1305
01:16:02.085 --> 01:16:05.005
Thank you. Don.

1306
01:16:05.088 --> 01:16:09.483
You could've shot me earlier
upstairs. but you didn't.

1307
01:16:12.225 --> 01:16:15.533
How you behaved
was honestly heroic.

1308
01:16:17.056 --> 01:16:19.276
I don't use that word lightly.

1309
01:16:20.582 --> 01:16:22.718
You have been the only thing
stopping him

1310
01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:25.504
from doing God knows what to me.

1311
01:16:25.587 --> 01:16:28.067
I don't talk to you.

1312
01:16:29.155 --> 01:16:31.814
That's how it is.

1313
01:16:31.897 --> 01:16:34.338
So stay quiet.

1314
01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:36.510
But you know
this is crazy. right?

1315
01:16:37.903 --> 01:16:40.170
You know this is wrong.

1316
01:16:40.253 --> 01:16:41.694
I know you know that.

1317
01:16:41.777 --> 01:16:42.912
Shut up.

1318
01:16:42.995 --> 01:16:44.784
I'm just saying.

1319
01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:46.786
There is a world. Don.

1320
01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:49.789
There is a world
where we help you

1321
01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:52.269
and your cousin and your aunt.

1322
01:16:52.352 --> 01:16:56.491
where reparations are paid
and a page is turned.

1323
01:16:56.574 --> 01:16:58.928
All of that can happen for you.

1324
01:16:59.011 --> 01:17:00.974
No. You're...

1325
01:17:01.057 --> 01:17:03.324
You're gonna get
me and Teddy arrested.

1326
01:17:03.407 --> 01:17:05.021
No. I wouldn't.

1327
01:17:05.104 --> 01:17:07.720
And-and if you're right
and Teddy gets arrested.

1328
01:17:07.803 --> 01:17:11.550
it's... it'll all be different
for you. Don.

1329
01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:14.422
It will. if you let me go.

1330
01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.597
Stop.

1331
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.639
I know what you're doing.

1332
01:17:19.858 --> 01:17:25.081
All he does is drag you deeper
and deeper into a pit.

1333
01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:29.519
He never actually offers you
a way out for you.

1334
01:17:30.826 --> 01:17:33.920
I can do that for you. Don.

1335
01:17:34.003 --> 01:17:35.617
I want to do that for you.

1336
01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.359
I said. shut up!

1337
01:17:38.442 --> 01:17:39.839
It's okay.

1338
01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:42.755
I know you're confused
and frustrated.

1339
01:17:42.838 --> 01:17:46.672
No one in the universe
could possibly blame you.

1340
01:17:46.755 --> 01:17:48.543
Shut up.

1341
01:17:48.626 --> 01:17:50.110
Put the gun down.

1342
01:17:50.193 --> 01:17:51.851
Just talk to me.

1343
01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:53.243
No.

1344
01:17:53.326 --> 01:17:55.158
Sit down and talk to me.
Put the gun down.

1345
01:17:55.241 --> 01:17:59.815
Just shut up. alien filth.

1346
01:17:59.898 --> 01:18:02.292
He ever show up again?

1347
01:18:05.904 --> 01:18:07.867
Fucking asshole.

1348
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.535
Sorry. I know he's your dad
and you probably love him.

1349
01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:13.738
I literally
wouldn't recognize him.

1350
01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:21.184
Look. Teddy. um...

1351
01:18:21.267 --> 01:18:24.662
I know it was a long time ago.
what I did to you. man.

1352
01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:26.625
It's fine.

1353
01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:28.365
No. It wasn't fine.

1354
01:18:28.448 --> 01:18:30.411
It-it was wrong.
but I promise you.

1355
01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:32.152
it's-it's not 'cause I liked it.

1356
01:18:32.235 --> 01:18:33.762
It was just...

1357
01:18:33.845 --> 01:18:34.981
you know. probably
some weird power thing.

1358
01:18:35.064 --> 01:18:38.245
I was... I was young
and lost. and...

1359
01:18:38.328 --> 01:18:42.553
I promise you. dude. I never.
ever did that to anybody else.

1360
01:18:42.636 --> 01:18:44.991
Just forget it. It's done.

1361
01:18:45.074 --> 01:18:46.296
Seriously.

1362
01:18:46.379 --> 01:18:49.251
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1363
01:18:53.909 --> 01:18:54.827
Hey. you should read this.

1364
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:57.042
This shit helped me a lot.

1365
01:18:58.783 --> 01:19:00.350
Thank you. dude.

1366
01:19:01.351 --> 01:19:03.570
Hey. you want to see my bees?

1367
01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:08.144
Someone's up there. right?

1368
01:19:08.227 --> 01:19:10.973
Shut up.

1369
01:19:11.056 --> 01:19:12.671
Is it the police?

1370
01:19:12.754 --> 01:19:15.021
I said. shut up.

1371
01:19:15.104 --> 01:19:16.849
It is.

1372
01:19:16.932 --> 01:19:19.808
And. Don. they're gonna
arrest your cousin.

1373
01:19:19.891 --> 01:19:22.071
But it is not too late for you.

1374
01:19:22.154 --> 01:19:25.205
Please. stop.

1375
01:19:25.288 --> 01:19:27.555
If you let me go right now.

1376
01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:29.731
everything will work out
for you.

1377
01:19:29.814 --> 01:19:30.993
No. it won't.

1378
01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:33.122
It will. Don.

1379
01:19:34.427 --> 01:19:35.737
I promise.

1380
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.304
You don't understand.

1381
01:19:37.387 --> 01:19:39.698
There's nothing left for me.

1382
01:19:39.781 --> 01:19:42.305
Teddy is all I have.

1383
01:19:43.349 --> 01:19:46.400
We'll find something else
for you.

1384
01:19:46.483 --> 01:19:47.749
You don't need him.

1385
01:19:47.832 --> 01:19:49.882
Yes. I do.

1386
01:19:49.965 --> 01:19:51.880
I love him.

1387
01:19:53.272 --> 01:19:55.496
Sorry I couldn't
help you find that lady.

1388
01:19:55.579 --> 01:19:56.797
It's all right. man.

1389
01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:06.246
I got it.

1390
01:20:06.329 --> 01:20:07.682
Thanks.

1391
01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:10.159
-Be gentle.
-Yep. yep.

1392
01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:20.347
There is so much else
out there. Don.

1393
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:22.305
No. there's not.

1394
01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:23.916
Not here.

1395
01:20:23.999 --> 01:20:25.308
Then where?

1396
01:20:25.391 --> 01:20:28.094
Where do you want to go. Don?

1397
01:20:28.177 --> 01:20:29.573
We can go there.

1398
01:20:29.656 --> 01:20:31.267
I'll take you there.

1399
01:20:32.398 --> 01:20:35.405
If you are an alien.
will you help me?

1400
01:20:35.488 --> 01:20:38.757
Don. that's enough of that.
Please.

1401
01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.280
You know I'm not an alien.

1402
01:20:40.363 --> 01:20:41.890
You know that.

1403
01:20:41.973 --> 01:20:46.456
But if you are.
would you take me with you?

1404
01:20:47.849 --> 01:20:49.158
What?

1405
01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:50.986
If all of this is true

1406
01:20:51.069 --> 01:20:54.468
and you have a sh... spaceship.

1407
01:20:54.551 --> 01:20:57.423
would you take me away
from here?

1408
01:21:00.905 --> 01:21:02.955
Of course. Don.

1409
01:21:03.038 --> 01:21:04.822
Yes. absolutely.

1410
01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:07.564
I'll take you with me.

1411
01:21:08.608 --> 01:21:11.050
We'll leave Earth.

1412
01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:14.092
I promise
that's what'll happen. okay?

1413
01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:17.008
If you let me go.

1414
01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:22.496
Thank you...

1415
01:21:22.579 --> 01:21:24.672
but not without Teddy.

1416
01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:27.240
Please. Don.
we don't have much time.

1417
01:21:27.323 --> 01:21:29.329
Th-They're gonna break in here
at any minute.

1418
01:21:29.412 --> 01:21:31.935
and then I won't be able
to help you.

1419
01:21:35.026 --> 01:21:36.549
Come on.

1420
01:21:49.736 --> 01:21:51.177
Okay.

1421
01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.479
I'm ready to leave.

1422
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.138
Okay.

1423
01:21:56.221 --> 01:21:59.968
Can you do one thing for me?

1424
01:22:00.051 --> 01:22:05.796
Tell Teddy that I'm sorry
and that I love him.

1425
01:22:07.711 --> 01:22:09.452
I will.

1426
01:22:16.415 --> 01:22:18.242
The fuck?

1427
01:22:22.856 --> 01:22:25.772
Jesus fucking Christ.

1428
01:22:27.035 --> 01:22:29.384
Fuck.

1429
01:22:57.761 --> 01:22:59.201
Don?

1430
01:22:59.284 --> 01:23:01.199
Don!

1431
01:23:03.288 --> 01:23:04.641
Jesus!

1432
01:23:04.724 --> 01:23:06.078
Don.

1433
01:23:06.161 --> 01:23:07.862
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1434
01:23:07.945 --> 01:23:09.646
I swear to you.
he did it to himself.

1435
01:23:09.729 --> 01:23:11.083
-He thought the police were coming...
-Don. No. no. no.

1436
01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:12.345
...and he panicked.
and he just freaked out.

1437
01:23:12.428 --> 01:23:13.650
Teddy. no. No.

1438
01:23:13.733 --> 01:23:15.489
-What did you say to him?
-Nothing.

1439
01:23:16.998 --> 01:23:20.135
What fucking filth did you
fill his sad brain with.

1440
01:23:20.218 --> 01:23:21.528
you demon from hell?

1441
01:23:21.611 --> 01:23:23.660
He was under
extreme pressure. Teddy.

1442
01:23:23.743 --> 01:23:26.011
-He cracked.
-And you cracked him!

1443
01:23:26.094 --> 01:23:28.404
You poisoned his heart
with lies and bullshit

1444
01:23:28.487 --> 01:23:30.929
until his whole fucking world
collapsed. didn't you?

1445
01:23:31.012 --> 01:23:32.974
You fed him
a fucking fairy tale.

1446
01:23:33.057 --> 01:23:35.063
He did all of this for you.
you fucking maniac.

1447
01:23:35.146 --> 01:23:36.717
Don't kill me. Teddy.

1448
01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.846
I have a cure for your mother.

1449
01:23:40.804 --> 01:23:43.071
-What?
-There's a cure.

1450
01:23:43.154 --> 01:23:45.504
You can save her.

1451
01:23:46.592 --> 01:23:47.815
What are you saying?

1452
01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.991
Inside of her.

1453
01:23:50.074 --> 01:23:51.950
a big change is taking place.

1454
01:23:52.033 --> 01:23:54.778
It's an entire rearranging

1455
01:23:54.861 --> 01:23:56.955
<i>of her genetic code.</i>

1456
01:23:57.038 --> 01:23:58.869
<i>She was the first sample.</i>

1457
01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:00.567
<i>It's a very important
Andromedan experiment.</i>

1458
01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:02.569
<i>and it takes four to five years.</i>

1459
01:24:02.652 --> 01:24:04.571
<i>But if it succeeds.
she will wake up.</i>

1460
01:24:04.654 --> 01:24:06.834
Well. what if
it doesn't succeed?

1461
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.531
Then she'll die.

1462
01:24:08.614 --> 01:24:10.881
But if we chemically terminate
the experiment.

1463
01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:12.971
she will wake up.
she'll wake up.

1464
01:24:13.054 --> 01:24:15.669
Well. how...
how-how do we do that?

1465
01:24:15.752 --> 01:24:17.497
-You have my car?
-Yes.

1466
01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.586
Okay. So. in my car.

1467
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:23.329
in the trunk. in the back.
there is a bottle.

1468
01:24:23.412 --> 01:24:26.941
It's a yellow jug. and it says
"monoethylene glycol."

1469
01:24:27.024 --> 01:24:28.595
Antifreeze.
But forget the label.

1470
01:24:28.678 --> 01:24:30.162
It's not antifreeze.
It's the cure.

1471
01:24:30.245 --> 01:24:33.208
I keep it in my car.
in the trunk.

1472
01:24:33.291 --> 01:24:36.037
in the antifreeze jug
to hide it.

1473
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.643
For safety.

1474
01:24:40.081 --> 01:24:41.956
<i>If...</i>

1475
01:24:42.039 --> 01:24:44.611
<i>i-if this experiment
is so important.</i>

1476
01:24:44.694 --> 01:24:47.092
<i>why would you allow me
to cancel it? Huh?</i>

1477
01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:49.137
<i>There are multiple experiments</i>

1478
01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:52.098
<i>happening all over the world...
your mother's one of dozens.</i>

1479
01:24:52.397 --> 01:24:53.533
<i>Just trust me.</i>

1480
01:24:53.616 --> 01:24:54.882
I'm chained up here.

1481
01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:57.227
I have no way of escaping.
Why would I lie?

1482
01:25:05.932 --> 01:25:07.242
- -
- That's for Don.

1483
01:25:07.325 --> 01:25:08.847
you fucking virus.

1484
01:27:43.046 --> 01:27:45.440
It's not antifreeze. Mom.

1485
01:27:46.615 --> 01:27:48.573
Don't worry.

1486
01:28:28.657 --> 01:28:30.876
Wake up. Mom. Wake up.

1487
01:28:33.052 --> 01:28:35.184
Come on. Come on.

1488
01:28:40.712 --> 01:28:42.065
Please. Mom. Please.

1489
01:28:42.148 --> 01:28:44.280
Come on. come on. Wake up.

1490
01:29:10.046 --> 01:29:11.352
Come on.

1491
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.698
Mom?

1492
01:29:49.781 --> 01:29:50.917
Wake up.

1493
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.962
You can do it.

1494
01:29:53.045 --> 01:29:54.830
Wake up.

1495
01:30:06.363 --> 01:30:09.192
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.
fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

1496
01:30:18.984 --> 01:30:20.463
NURSE [in distance]:
201. now!

1497
01:30:37.655 --> 01:30:39.614
Hey! Hey!

1498
01:30:40.658 --> 01:30:41.963
Hey!

1499
01:31:13.909 --> 01:31:16.568
You fucking monster.

1500
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:19.092
How many were Andromedans?

1501
01:31:19.175 --> 01:31:21.224
You-you... you lied to me.

1502
01:31:21.307 --> 01:31:24.048
How many were Andromedans?!

1503
01:31:26.008 --> 01:31:28.489
-Two.
-Two?

1504
01:31:31.013 --> 01:31:32.627
You miserable fucking idiot.

1505
01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:33.976
Do you know what you've done?

1506
01:31:34.059 --> 01:31:35.413
You...

1507
01:31:35.496 --> 01:31:36.762
you killed her.

1508
01:31:36.845 --> 01:31:38.149
Quiet.

1509
01:31:39.804 --> 01:31:43.856
And I'll tell you why it is
I resemble a human.

1510
01:31:43.939 --> 01:31:46.680
Our 75th emperor
first discovered the Earth.

1511
01:31:48.944 --> 01:31:51.472
This planet was ruled
by dinosaurs.

1512
01:31:51.555 --> 01:31:55.476
magnificent creatures with
a complex but stable ecosystem.

1513
01:31:55.559 --> 01:31:58.000
Oh.

1514
01:31:58.083 --> 01:32:02.044
But we inadvertently spread
a fatal virus to the planet.

1515
01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:05.486
And the emperor was struck
with guilt.

1516
01:32:05.569 --> 01:32:07.658
watching all of Earth's
creatures perish.

1517
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:10.709
So he gave new life
to this planet.

1518
01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:14.060
Life resembling us.

1519
01:32:14.143 --> 01:32:16.105
The early test humans
could barely stand.

1520
01:32:16.188 --> 01:32:19.714
but soon they walked
and began to reproduce.

1521
01:32:21.237 --> 01:32:24.200
A civilization was born
in harmony with nature.

1522
01:32:24.283 --> 01:32:26.899
Atlantis.

1523
01:32:26.982 --> 01:32:29.467
We were worshipped as gods.

1524
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:33.122
But some humans wished
to surpass us.

1525
01:32:33.205 --> 01:32:35.864
so they began creating
their own new.

1526
01:32:35.947 --> 01:32:40.042
lab-grown humans
that were stronger.

1527
01:32:40.125 --> 01:32:41.827
But the new humans were
also more aggressive.

1528
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:44.133
so a conflict broke out

1529
01:32:44.216 --> 01:32:46.701
that eventually resulted in
a thermonuclear war.

1530
01:32:46.784 --> 01:32:49.748
And in the war's wake. all
of humanity was extinguished.

1531
01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:52.838
save for a select few.
who built an ark

1532
01:32:52.921 --> 01:32:55.144
and traveled the oceans
for a century.

1533
01:32:55.227 --> 01:32:57.756
When it was finally safe
to resurface on dry land.

1534
01:32:57.839 --> 01:32:59.845
the leaders of the ark died.

1535
01:32:59.928 --> 01:33:03.022
leaving behind
only a few mutant specimens

1536
01:33:03.105 --> 01:33:06.286
of degraded semi-humans.

1537
01:33:06.369 --> 01:33:08.110
The apes.

1538
01:33:09.198 --> 01:33:11.291
Evolution resumed
but toward chaos.

1539
01:33:11.374 --> 01:33:14.555
The newly evolved human beings.
your current ancestors.

1540
01:33:14.638 --> 01:33:18.428
fought amongst themselves
in an endless cycle of war.

1541
01:33:18.511 --> 01:33:21.388
genocide.
ecological destruction.

1542
01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:23.433
They brutalized Earth.

1543
01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:25.827
They ruined her waters.
ravaged her climate.

1544
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:28.700
poisoned themselves
with drugs and technology.

1545
01:33:28.783 --> 01:33:31.267
And even when presented
with irrefutable evidence

1546
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:36.925
of their own self-destruction.
the humans continued unabated.

1547
01:33:37.008 --> 01:33:40.450
Even I myself became more human.

1548
01:33:40.533 --> 01:33:42.148
more selfish and cruel.

1549
01:33:42.231 --> 01:33:45.538
the longer I stayed here
amongst your kind.

1550
01:33:46.714 --> 01:33:49.068
But humans can't help
the way they are.

1551
01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:51.283
It's in your genes.

1552
01:33:52.415 --> 01:33:54.639
The genes implanted
by your ancestors

1553
01:33:54.722 --> 01:33:56.423
to strengthen themselves.

1554
01:33:56.506 --> 01:34:00.079
It gets reproduced in your
bodies. and it grows stronger.

1555
01:34:00.162 --> 01:34:04.518
We Andromedans are here to
eliminate that suicidal gene.

1556
01:34:04.601 --> 01:34:07.086
To save humanity.

1557
01:34:07.169 --> 01:34:10.959
But also to save Earth
from you and your kind.

1558
01:34:11.042 --> 01:34:12.826
No.

1559
01:34:14.567 --> 01:34:17.139
No. you came here to kill us.

1560
01:34:17.222 --> 01:34:18.576
Y-You came to kill us.

1561
01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:20.447
Well. that's wrong.
That's wrong. Teddy.

1562
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.014
Some of us would have preferred

1563
01:34:22.097 --> 01:34:24.059
to simply eliminate
your species.

1564
01:34:24.142 --> 01:34:25.757
but the emperor believed
there was still hope.

1565
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.108
so the experiments.

1566
01:34:29.191 --> 01:34:30.849
The experiments
your mother was a part of.

1567
01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:32.938
She was chosen
because she was weak.

1568
01:34:33.021 --> 01:34:34.592
Because she was broken.

1569
01:34:34.675 --> 01:34:36.681
If we could correct her.

1570
01:34:36.764 --> 01:34:39.597
perhaps all humans
could be corrected.

1571
01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.077
But you... you killed her!

1572
01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.036
You killed her.

1573
01:34:44.119 --> 01:34:45.603
I figured you'd be apprehended

1574
01:34:45.686 --> 01:34:47.300
feeding antifreeze
to a coma patient

1575
01:34:47.383 --> 01:34:50.085
and then I'd be freed
and could return to my work.

1576
01:34:50.168 --> 01:34:54.046
But you actually got away
with it. you sick ape.

1577
01:34:54.129 --> 01:34:55.482
I'm not a sick ape.

1578
01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:57.393
You are a sick ape.

1579
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:00.182
Listen. there are other
test subjects

1580
01:35:00.265 --> 01:35:01.749
who are showing progress.

1581
01:35:01.832 --> 01:35:03.533
and we must show the emperor
the truth.

1582
01:35:03.616 --> 01:35:05.666
Tomorrow.

1583
01:35:05.749 --> 01:35:07.320
During the lunar eclipse.

1584
01:35:07.403 --> 01:35:10.018
Why?

1585
01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:11.846
Teddy. listen. I know. I know.

1586
01:35:11.929 --> 01:35:13.761
You may hate me.

1587
01:35:13.844 --> 01:35:16.808
you may want me dead...
I don't blame you...

1588
01:35:16.891 --> 01:35:19.593
but I have the information
you need to save Earth.

1589
01:35:19.676 --> 01:35:21.247
and you know I do.

1590
01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:23.205
You're a fucking demon.

1591
01:35:23.288 --> 01:35:26.252
This is our destiny. Teddy Gatz.

1592
01:35:26.335 --> 01:35:28.254
Yours and mine.

1593
01:35:28.337 --> 01:35:30.861
And the hour is almost upon us.

1594
01:35:32.428 --> 01:35:34.211
Yay.

1595
01:35:45.658 --> 01:35:47.273
Jesus. Ms. Fuller?

1596
01:35:47.356 --> 01:35:48.535
Hi. Ricky.

1597
01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.102
How are you? I'm back.

1598
01:35:50.185 --> 01:35:51.625
Could you buzz me in. please?

1599
01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:53.279
Are you okay?
Are you-you all right?

1600
01:35:53.362 --> 01:35:54.541
Oh. I'm all right.

1601
01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:56.151
Everything's been sorted out.

1602
01:35:56.234 --> 01:35:58.478
Could you just...
could you buzz me in. please?

1603
01:35:58.759 --> 01:36:00.630
Thank you. Ricky.

1604
01:36:25.437 --> 01:36:28.049
Park in your usual spot.

1605
01:36:30.965 --> 01:36:32.749
Don't worry. Don.

1606
01:36:34.098 --> 01:36:36.797
You're coming with me.
I'm taking you with me.

1607
01:36:51.202 --> 01:36:52.512
Hi. Tony.

1608
01:36:52.595 --> 01:36:54.858
There you go.
Have a good evening.

1609
01:37:07.349 --> 01:37:08.828
Hello.

1610
01:37:14.530 --> 01:37:16.314
Doors opening.

1611
01:37:21.232 --> 01:37:23.104
Doors closing.

1612
01:37:28.892 --> 01:37:30.289
Hi.

1613
01:37:30.372 --> 01:37:32.117
Good to see you.

1614
01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.636
It's good to be back.

1615
01:37:34.637 --> 01:37:36.204
Hmm.

1616
01:37:37.466 --> 01:37:39.298
Oh. it's-it's 5:35.

1617
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:41.779
so if any of you need
to go home. just...

1618
01:37:41.862 --> 01:37:43.737
you know. feel free.

1619
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.565
-Hi. Corey.
-Michelle?

1620
01:37:45.648 --> 01:37:49.003
Uh. we have some business
to do. so. um. no disturbances.

1621
01:37:49.086 --> 01:37:50.526
-Okay?
-Okay?

1622
01:37:50.609 --> 01:37:52.350
All right. Thank you.

1623
01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:03.713
Okay. so. uh. he-he meets us
here then? Or...

1624
01:38:03.796 --> 01:38:06.847
Uh. we make remote contact
with the emperor here.

1625
01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:09.328
and then they beam us up.

1626
01:38:09.411 --> 01:38:11.809
Beam us up?

1627
01:38:11.892 --> 01:38:13.981
Or. you know. transport.

1628
01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:16.635
Okay.

1629
01:38:18.942 --> 01:38:21.209
Uh. it sometimes
takes a couple of minutes

1630
01:38:21.292 --> 01:38:24.252
to get the link working. so...

1631
01:38:26.558 --> 01:38:27.999
Okay.

1632
01:38:28.082 --> 01:38:33.482
Uh. and. uh. how exactly
do we make the link?

1633
01:38:33.565 --> 01:38:36.268
Uh. this will sound crazy.
but. um.

1634
01:38:36.351 --> 01:38:39.532
I-I punch in a code here.

1635
01:38:39.615 --> 01:38:44.925
and then. um. it initiates
a link with the ship.

1636
01:38:46.578 --> 01:38:49.237
-On a calculator?
-Yeah. I know.

1637
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.457
I know. It had to look banal.

1638
01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.241
And human.

1639
01:38:53.324 --> 01:38:55.635
And. you know.
inconspicuous. so...

1640
01:38:55.718 --> 01:38:58.464
It's a 58-digit code.
and I have it memorized.

1641
01:38:58.547 --> 01:39:00.988
but it's been a while
since I had to...

1642
01:39:01.071 --> 01:39:03.552
since I had to type it out.
so...

1643
01:39:11.864 --> 01:39:13.566
So. is this.
is this really how it works?

1644
01:39:13.649 --> 01:39:15.785
You know. it's better
if we don't talk. actually.

1645
01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:17.439
Just because I... Sorry.

1646
01:39:17.522 --> 01:39:22.705
It's a... It's this memory.
um. thing that I do.

1647
01:39:22.788 --> 01:39:24.403
like a trick for...

1648
01:39:24.486 --> 01:39:26.318
for remembering.

1649
01:39:26.401 --> 01:39:27.837
Um...

1650
01:39:33.147 --> 01:39:34.496
Um...

1651
01:39:39.675 --> 01:39:41.289
Can they see through here?

1652
01:39:41.372 --> 01:39:42.464
-Oh. no.
-Can they...

1653
01:39:42.547 --> 01:39:44.201
-Can they see in here?
-No.

1654
01:39:45.159 --> 01:39:47.073
Um...

1655
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:55.434
-Why is it so long?
-It's...

1656
01:39:55.517 --> 01:39:57.175
I have a few. um...

1657
01:39:57.258 --> 01:39:59.133
Just shh-shh for a.
for a second while I think.

1658
01:39:59.216 --> 01:40:01.479
-Oh. Sorry.
-Um...

1659
01:40:08.399 --> 01:40:11.276
Yeah. Okay.

1660
01:40:11.359 --> 01:40:13.278
That's...

1661
01:40:13.361 --> 01:40:15.802
That's it. Um...

1662
01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:17.717
I mean. I just have
to press "enter." mainly.

1663
01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:19.628
So. are you ready?

1664
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:22.113
Yes. I'm ready.

1665
01:40:22.196 --> 01:40:23.984
Fuck. wait.

1666
01:40:24.067 --> 01:40:26.117
My air tank.

1667
01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.075
I'll need oxygen.
and I don't have my air tank.

1668
01:40:28.158 --> 01:40:30.034
Oh. there'll be oxygen. Teddy.

1669
01:40:30.117 --> 01:40:31.731
Okay.

1670
01:40:31.814 --> 01:40:34.299
What about Don?

1671
01:40:34.382 --> 01:40:36.605
Oh. we'll send for Don.

1672
01:40:36.688 --> 01:40:39.604
We may even be able
to revive him.

1673
01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:43.482
Right. So. it's happening. Shit.

1674
01:40:43.565 --> 01:40:44.874
Um...

1675
01:40:44.957 --> 01:40:46.441
No. I'm ready. I'm ready.

1676
01:40:46.524 --> 01:40:48.400
Um...

1677
01:40:48.483 --> 01:40:53.057
you should know that I've
prepared for all eventualities.

1678
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.537
Okay. Prepared how?

1679
01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:56.669
Oh.

1680
01:40:56.752 --> 01:40:58.932
Oh. shit. Teddy.

1681
01:40:59.015 --> 01:41:02.066
I can't take the chance of you
just killing me straightaway.

1682
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:03.545
No.
That was smart.

1683
01:41:03.628 --> 01:41:05.199
That was very smart.

1684
01:41:05.282 --> 01:41:08.372
and the emperor will admire
your intelligence.

1685
01:41:10.505 --> 01:41:13.381
You're a credit
to your species. Teddy. Truly.

1686
01:41:13.464 --> 01:41:15.988
Well. I'm just trying to help.

1687
01:41:17.903 --> 01:41:20.084
I know. Teddy.

1688
01:41:20.167 --> 01:41:24.784
Um. so this... this closet here
is a teleporter.

1689
01:41:24.867 --> 01:41:26.612
So you'll...
you'll enter the closet.

1690
01:41:26.695 --> 01:41:28.353
and then you'll close
the door behind you.

1691
01:41:28.436 --> 01:41:32.357
And then I'll-I'll count
to three and press "enter."

1692
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.054
And we'll have to go
one after the other

1693
01:41:34.137 --> 01:41:36.274
so that our bodies don't
reconstitute together

1694
01:41:36.357 --> 01:41:38.406
during teleportation.
You understand?

1695
01:41:38.489 --> 01:41:39.886
Uh-huh.

1696
01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:41.623
Yeah. I think so.

1697
01:41:43.538 --> 01:41:46.023
So I just go in the closet?

1698
01:41:46.106 --> 01:41:48.634
-I can go first. I...
-No. no. no. no.

1699
01:41:48.717 --> 01:41:50.375
I'll go first.
I don't want you to escape

1700
01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:51.811
and just leave me here.

1701
01:41:51.894 --> 01:41:54.026
Okay.

1702
01:42:09.259 --> 01:42:10.347
Ready?

1703
01:42:12.828 --> 01:42:14.525
I'm ready.

1704
01:42:15.787 --> 01:42:17.702
I'll see you up there.

1705
01:42:24.448 --> 01:42:26.320
Three.

1706
01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:29.671
Two.

1707
01:42:31.368 --> 01:42:32.890
One.

1708
01:43:15.107 --> 01:43:16.852
You're gonna be fine.

1709
01:43:16.935 --> 01:43:18.593
Yeah. I-I know.

1710
01:43:18.676 --> 01:43:22.728
I mean. obviously
the shock of it all is...

1711
01:43:22.811 --> 01:43:25.122
But you can get plenty of help
for that kind of thing.

1712
01:43:25.205 --> 01:43:26.862
So he's dead then?

1713
01:43:26.945 --> 01:43:29.038
-Yeah. he passed away.
-Okay.

1714
01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:32.825
The bomb must have reacted
to his body heat or friction.

1715
01:43:32.908 --> 01:43:34.522
It happens a lot
with homemade explosives.

1716
01:43:34.605 --> 01:43:36.045
Right.

1717
01:43:36.128 --> 01:43:37.612
-Ma'am. please don't take that off.
-Look.

1718
01:43:37.695 --> 01:43:39.223
Ma'am. I'm gonna need you
to lie back down.

1719
01:43:39.306 --> 01:43:40.615
-I'm fine.
-You need to stay here.

1720
01:43:40.698 --> 01:43:42.313
-Can you just stay still?
-I'm good.

1721
01:43:42.396 --> 01:43:43.705
-I'm good. I'm good.
-Ma'am. Please. Hold on. Stop!

1722
01:43:43.788 --> 01:43:45.881
Wait! Hold on!

1723
01:43:45.964 --> 01:43:47.226
Stop.

1724
01:44:49.767 --> 01:44:51.251
Hey. um. you're not...

1725
01:44:51.334 --> 01:44:53.253
Sorry. you're not. uh...

1726
01:44:53.336 --> 01:44:54.950
Oh. I just... I forgot something.

1727
01:44:55.033 --> 01:44:56.778
Just really quickly. One second.

1728
01:44:56.861 --> 01:44:58.127
-You're not allowed in there.
-Just-just one sec. one sec.

1729
01:44:58.210 --> 01:45:00.430
Don't touch that! Hey! Hey!

1730
01:45:02.432 --> 01:45:04.304
Oh. my God. Jesus.

1731
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:11.157
Emperor.

1732
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.291
We believed contact would
be made if help was required.

1733
01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:18.077
We could not contact you
without hair.

1734
01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.380
Yes. we know.

1735
01:46:20.945 --> 01:46:22.690
We feel remorse.

1736
01:46:22.773 --> 01:46:24.340
There was nothing we could do.

1737
01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.999
We all feel remorse.

1738
01:46:27.082 --> 01:46:29.084
That's over now.

1739
01:46:29.998 --> 01:46:31.913
Inform us of the experiments

1740
01:46:33.131 --> 01:46:35.573
on the human subjects.

1741
01:46:35.656 --> 01:46:38.140
The experiments
have nearly all failed.

1742
01:46:38.223 --> 01:46:41.927
There are only two
human subjects remaining

1743
01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:44.099
and the likelihood of success

1744
01:46:44.534 --> 01:46:46.584
is zero.

1745
01:46:46.667 --> 01:46:48.977
Because of who they are.

1746
01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:52.977
A decision needs to be made.

1747
01:47:03.814 --> 01:47:06.168
We believe

1748
01:47:06.251 --> 01:47:08.519
that it is over.

1749
01:47:08.602 --> 01:47:11.130
They have had their time.

1750
01:47:11.213 --> 01:47:14.176
And in their time
they have imperiled

1751
01:47:14.259 --> 01:47:16.653
the life they share.

1752
01:47:17.524 --> 01:47:19.443
And so we have decided

1753
01:47:19.526 --> 01:47:22.093
their time will end.
