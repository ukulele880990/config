of the emergency?

5
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.958
Somebody got shot!

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.337
Boys. come here.
Y'all boys come here! Come here!

7
00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.925
Come here. Stay over here.

8
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.887
-You sure she got shot?
-Yes!

9
00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:58.183
Oh my God! Why did she do this?

10
00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.144
Wake up.

11
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.938
Okay. they're going
as fast as they can. Where is it?

12
00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.857
Right here! Right here!

13
00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.320
We need medical aid right there.

14
00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.072
She's on the ground!

15
00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.667
Hold on.

16
00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:26.920
Oh my God!

17
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.714
I'm in front. I'm in front.

18
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.592
Sheriff's office.
Come outside with your hands up!

19
00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.972
It's the Marion County Sheriff's Office!
Come outside with your hands up!

20
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.787
Monday.
June 5th. 2023. 9:38 a.m.

21
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.665
We're out at the incident location.

22
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.042
Just doing a canvass.

23
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.088
Okay.

24
00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.174
Sheriff's office.

25
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.012
Sheriff's office!

26
00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.597
Hello. Good morning.

27
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.183
I'm good. I'm with
the sheriff's office. I'm the detective.

28
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:25.603
We're investigating the incident
that happened on Friday night.

29
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.023
You mind if I sit?
Well. the chair's broken.

30
00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.524
Let me go get you a chair.

31
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.735
How long
you been living here?

32
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.236
About three years.

33
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.198
Has she lived here
the whole time. or something different?

34
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.116
No. she moved in after we did.

35
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.451
Maybe two years she's been here.

36
00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.995
-If I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure...
-That's fine.

37
00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.705
So approximately two years.

38
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:48.001
But from my understanding.
everybody. all the kids.

39
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.253
has problems with this lady.

40
00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.839
-What grade ya in?
-Fifth…

41
00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:56.009
Okay. so you just finished
fifth grade and you're going into sixth.

42
00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:59.137
I want to discuss
a truth versus a lie. okay?

43
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.015
I'm going to give you a few
examples here for a second. okay?

44
00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.018
If I were to tell you
that there was a little girl.

45
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.227
and she came in this room.

46
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.229
and she colored all the walls red
with a crayon.

47
00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.398
and then she came outside
and told me she didn't do it…

48
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.442
-Is that the truth or a lie?
-That's a lie.

49
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.569
Okay. And if
she colored them all red.

50
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.197
then she went outside and said.
"I did that. Detective Pinder…"

51
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.199
-Would that be the truth?
-Yes.

52
00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.911
Okay. When we talk today.
can we only talk about true things?

53
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:23.994
Yes.

54
00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:26.748
Have you ever
seen this lady before?

55
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.041
Multiple times. yeah.

56
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.500
Multiple times.

57
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:36.216
She doesn't like people playing
around. over where. like. she lives.

58
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.343
like. in that grass over there.

59
00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:43.848
Because… she thinks
that it's her property.

60
00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.391
Okay.

61
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.645
Um. and was she…
Do you remember her saying anything else?

62
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:51.814
That I'm going
to report this to the police.

63
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.525
-Okay.
-Us playing around the area.

64
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.877
097 in progress.

65
00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.740
What did you call for?

66
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.910
I called because the lady across the
street on the phone hit me with a sign.

67
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.122
Her children were walking their dog
on the property.

68
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:50.915
It clearly says. "No Trespassing."

69
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.375
And they're always walking the dog.

70
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.835
The dog's always taking a crap.

71
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.004
There's poop on the sidewalk.
All kinds of stuff.

72
00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.714
I said. "Can you keep the dog over there?"

73
00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.341
I was going to take a picture of her dog

74
00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.718
and she said.
"Don't take a picture of my children."

75
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.677
And I'm like. "Nah."

76
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.429
And then she just got in my face

77
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.181
and she picked up the sign
and threw it at me.

78
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.599
And it hit me in the leg.

79
00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.644
-Your name?
-My name is Susan Lorincz.

80
00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:16.482
-Susan. Spell that last name.
-L-O-R-I-N-C-Z.

81
00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.694
What was
that sign you mentioned?

82
00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:20.820
Want me to get it?

83
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:29.203
I mean. you can see
she really threw it at me.

84
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.915
She shouldn't have removed the sign.
It's the landlord's sign.

85
00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.835
I was actually going to buy this
apartment. After this. I'm leaving.

86
00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.503
I'm not going to buy the quad.

87
00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:47.722
I see a smirk
on your face. You already know?

88
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:50.392
-That she called the police on me?
-Yes. I see you're on the phone.

89
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.935
-With that little smirk.
-Because this is… this is…

90
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.440
It's funny. because
I'm the one that never comes outside

91
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:02.070
and says anything to her. but today.
I just happened to feel it.

92
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.782
First of all. before she moved in.
this big open space right here.

93
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:09.869
all the kids. they like to play kickball.
football. in the space.

94
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.831
She moves in. "I don't want y'all playing
over here. it's private property."

95
00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.209
I told her. "No. you can't tell them.

96
00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:19.128
technically. if they're not in
your personal. personal space.

97
00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:23.341
that they can't walk the dog
or even throw their football over here."

98
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.552
"Oh. but you Black people always just…"

99
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.138
Okay. all right. whatever.
That doesn't move me.

100
00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.474
She's basically. like.
ramming the sign in my face.

101
00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:35.019
She went to pick it back up.
I picked the sign up and I threw the sign.

102
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.648
I literally picked the sign up.
and as I walked off. I threw the sign.

103
00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.859
I said. "I can go and buy a sign too.
It still doesn't mean anything."

104
00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.612
But she did say it was thrown her way.

105
00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.532
-Yeah. I did toss it. I'm not gonna lie.
-But it hit her.

106
00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:50.743
-I didn't hit her with the sign.
-Not deliberately. yes.

107
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.704
Do you have your information.
or do you want me to…

108
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.376
Ma'am.
can I talk to you real quick?

109
00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.961
-Me?
-Yes. ma'am.

110
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.838
Did you see anything?

111
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.507
No. sir. I didn't.
No. I just came outside.

112
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.926
Did your daughter tell you
that she saw anything?

113
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.806
Well. she did tell me
that they were arguing

114
00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.352
and that. I guess she had
picked up a sign and. like. just. like.

115
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.604
when she picked up the sign.
and she walked away

116
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.606
and threw it behind her.

117
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.444
And… But it didn't hit the lady
or anything. But that was it.

118
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.864
But I will say that that lady…
I didn't see anything.

119
00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.616
But I will say that that lady is
always messing with people's kids.

120
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.201
She's always...

121
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.914
She's always trying to record the kids
and always talking crap.

122
00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.625
But I didn't see anything. so I can't say.

123
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.376
Okay. All righty.

124
00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.796
Pronounce your first name.

125
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.631
Ajike.

126
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.053
How's it going?

127
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.805
Say it. another day.

128
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.100
-All right. well. just call me.
-Hey. ma'am.

129
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.811
-Did you see anything?
-Yeah. She didn't touch that lady.

130
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.440
She just took the thing out the ground.
and that was it.

131
00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:05.776
-What thing?
-The thing. The no trespassing thing.

132
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.862
No. she didn't throw it at her leg.

133
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:11.574
-She did not throw the damn thing…
-…because I never go.

134
00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.826
-No. she didn't throw it.
-She kind of tossed it.

135
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.620
Shut up. he's not over here
talking to you.

136
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:18.122
She just set it down.
and the lady just happened to be there.

137
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.501
She didn't throw it at the lady.
She didn't touch the lady or nothing.

138
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.170
All she did was tell the lady
to stop yelling at her kids.

139
00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.964
That lady yells
at everybody's kids out here.

140
00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:31.010
Okay. Well. I mean.
I wouldn't go over there anymore.

141
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:37.308
She might not like it
because I'm a Black female.

142
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:39.101
It's harassing people. like.

143
00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.186
you don't own this.

144
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.354
You can't tell people…

145
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:45.650
The more she says it.

146
00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.069
of course the children don't go
because they know.

147
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.695
Okay. what does that mean?

148
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:52.198
Can't go over there.

149
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.243
That's fine.
I mean. if it's hers. it's hers.

150
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.328
It doesn't matter
if it's not hers.

151
00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.121
She rents there. just like you rent here.

152
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.790
You wanted somebody trespassed
from right here.

153
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.334
you called us.
and we saw them on the property.

154
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:06.754
they'd be trespassed. and next time
we came out. they'd go to jail.

155
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.256
Okay?

156
00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.676
-It's the way that works.
-All right. I mean…

157
00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.761
You have the same right
as she does.

158
00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:16.389
I mean… She doesn't want them over there.

159
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.518
The landlord put a sign there
for a reason.

160
00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:22.436
-It is what it is.
-All right.

161
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.564
-Okay?
-Absolutely.

162
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.398
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:30.444
Okay. No problem at all.
I understand how you feel.

164
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.488
Believe me. That's why I got a house.

165
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:37.076
This is our last year.
Prayerfully. This is it.

166
00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:39.620
Case closed!

167
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.873
I'm gonna write it up as a battery.

168
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.793
Just no arrests can be made at this time.

169
00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:47.169
Okay.

170
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.214
The fact that I didn't actually get her
throwing the sign at me?

171
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:53.718
With nobody. and nobody
actually saying that they saw it.

172
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:57.597
No independent witnesses
that are credible. so…

173
00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:00.850
-How convenient.
-All righty?

174
00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.935
-Thank you so much.
-Yes. ma'am.

175
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.736
You need anything else?

176
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.196
No. we're just gonna
go on a walk really quick.

177
00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.241
I'm sorry. He's a big baby.

178
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.286
I love fur babies.

179
00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:25.124
What's his name?
What's that baby's name?

180
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:26.167
Cash.

181
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.585
Cash money.

182
00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:52.109
We're talking to people.
If anybody heard or saw anything

183
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.655
or know anything
about the people involved or anything.

184
00:10:55.738 --> 00:11:01.827
To be honest. sir.
all I know is that lady. the Black lady?

185
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.121
-She was always with her kids.
-Right.

186
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.332
She wasn't a threat or anything.

187
00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:08.376
-Right.
-At all whatsoever.

188
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:12.380
She has a little infant.
about two or three years old.

189
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.548
She's always in the house with him.

190
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.885
The two little boys and the little girl.

191
00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:21.013
they are the ones
that's always outside playing.

192
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.975
I've never heard anything negative
about this lady or anything.

193
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.772
Ajike. as a mom.
she was like the mom.

194
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:34.527
She was a manager for McDonald's.

195
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.946
You know. Ajike would switch
her schedule around.

196
00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:40.157
You know. "I can't work this day.
or can't do this. I can't do that"

197
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.535
just so she can be there for her kids.

198
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:47.206
Someone who sacrificed
for the children to have private school.

199
00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:51.210
football lessons. gymnastics.
dance. everything.

200
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:56.048
She would tell me
that there was this white woman

201
00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.800
that lived across the street

202
00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.510
that was always. you know.

203
00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:03.055
antagonizing the kids
and calling them names.

204
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.602
Why are they on private property
that they have no means…

205
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.145
I mean. they don't rent here.

206
00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.189
Well. if those people
aren't complaining.

207
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.149
I can't get them off that property.

208
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.277
Well. then I'll send
a cease and desist order to them.

209
00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.529
I'll have my lawyer do it.

210
00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:22.616
There is. in the real estate laws.
you should know this.

211
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.121
that you have the right to peaceful.
quiet enjoyment of your property.

212
00:12:27.204 --> 00:12:30.082
You know. that is in the law.

213
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.002
Well. that's civil. so we don't…
we don't really deal with that.

214
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.713
I understand.
but those kids shouldn't be over here.

215
00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:36.796
Okay.

216
00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.218
They shouldn't be screaming
and. you know. running around neither.

217
00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:44.513
I mean. the parents aren't attending them.
obviously. they're just…

218
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:48.184
I understand it's a nuisance.
but I'd rather kids be screaming

219
00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:50.561
'cause they're out here playing.
have a good time

220
00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:53.898
than stealing cars and robbing people. so…

221
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.113
All right. Well. you have a good night.

222
00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:07.244
What a fucking…

223
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:13.083
I own that building next door.
Apartment three.

224
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.168
Okay.

225
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:17.963
I put up a sign.
"Keep off the grass on my property line."

226
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.799
You put that up?

227
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:24.094
Yeah I told her. I says
I can't do any more than my property line.

228
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.555
And that's a very small portion.

229
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:30.142
The majority of the area
belongs to the other quad.

230
00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.145
-Okay.
-That's where they play. mostly.

231
00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:37.233
I'm having problems
with the neighbors' children.

232
00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:40.027
They come up to me
and just scream like idiots.

233
00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:44.281
And I finally lost my nerve today.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

234
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.992
I called the kids retards.
Then the mother comes screaming at me.

235
00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:50.913
"Don't call my children retards.
I'm going to put you in a nursing home."

236
00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:55.125
Um. is there anything I can do
with these people?

237
00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.127
Because they are getting ridiculous.

238
00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.797
I mean. I don't bug anybody.
I'm a single woman.

239
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.924
And I work from home.
You know. I'm peaceful.

240
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:05.135
I'm like the perfect neighbor.
You barely ever see me.

241
00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:10.015
Number three.
I think one and two is on that side?

242
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:36.834
Hello. sheriff's office.
What's going on this evening?

243
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.836
Lots of children screaming
their fool heads off.

244
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.087
running around.

245
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.631
I had my truck parked in front of here.

246
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.842
so I didn't have to listen
to the screaming and yelling.

247
00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:47.303
As soon as I moved the truck.
the kids are coming up.

248
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.762
I'm like. guys. stop.

249
00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:51.808
They know they're not supposed to be
here. They've been told a million times.

250
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.059
And the little kid tells me
to shut up to my face.

251
00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.478
I said. "Don't be disrespectful to me."

252
00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.480
And he's exchanging words back and forth.

253
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.650
I'm like. "Listen. my name is Dr. Lorincz.
Don't tell me to shut up."

254
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.319
And he was calling me names and I'm like.

255
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.904
no. no. no. we're not going to do that.

256
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.323
I'm going
to go talk to these kids.

257
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.162
Hello. sheriff's office.

258
00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:16.248
I'm Deputy Heckman.

259
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:21.086
Were any of you guys over here
messing with this lady?

260
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.547
No. We were playing football.

261
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.384
Hold on. Let me just say
one thing real quick.

262
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.094
Okay.

263
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:34.683
Because it's an open spot.
all of that is not her property.

264
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.977
So that man that does live right there.

265
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.938
he says that all the kids can play

266
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:41.815
because they like to play football
over there.

267
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.318
They literally.
they're nowhere near her property.

268
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.946
Y'all can watch her cameras.
They're right over there.

269
00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.365
She will come outside. yell at them.

270
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:54.286
I have yelled at her before
because these are children.

271
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.122
I mean. everyone down this whole block
has yelled at this lady.

272
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.916
because of how she talks to the kids.

273
00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.793
When someone.
when an adult says something.

274
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:02.169
now she wants to call the police.

275
00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.672
Kids are just
trying to be kids. I understand.

276
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.174
-I totally understand that.
-Right.

277
00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:08.759
What's going on. y'all?

278
00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:12.346
This is the mom
that went over there and spoke to her.

279
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.224
-Y'all on school break yet?
-Yeah.

280
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.642
When did that start?

281
00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:18.519
Um. like a week ago.

282
00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:21.855
What? I know some people
aren't starting until tomorrow.

283
00:16:23.732 --> 00:16:26.026
Ah. they got
dog doo-doo over here?

284
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.153
Ew. there's so much!

285
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.990
I'm sorry.
I want to step a little closer

286
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.866
because I can barely hear you.

287
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.453
I took my son to question
the one whose face that she was in.

288
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.872
And I sent the other two kids inside.

289
00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:41.125
I said that's it. y'all done playing.
come inside.

290
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.961
We go in there and I knock on her door.

291
00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:48.424
And immediately.
"Get the hell off my property."

292
00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:51.135
"You are trespassing.
Get the hell off my property."

293
00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:54.304
So I just said.
"Okay. I'm here with my son.

294
00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:58.892
and I just want to ask you what happened
because I'm not out here."

295
00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:03.063
And there have been times
where kids are going to be kids.

296
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:06.066
and she'll say something.
and they say something like "Okay. Karen."

297
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.068
-Or somethin' like that.
-Okay. sure.

298
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.195
I've always instructed my kids.

299
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.197
she's still an adult
at the end of the day.

300
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:14.241
You don't argue with her.
You come and you tell me.

301
00:17:14.324 --> 00:17:15.909
Let me take it up with her.

302
00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.662
Whose mom are you?
Any of them?

303
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.998
Well. they're all mine. I'm sorry. no.

304
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:25.169
My kids aren't really here. but
they are always outside playing with them.

305
00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:27.838
So let me just talk to you guys
real quick. okay?

306
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:33.093
-Um. what kind of names did she call you?
-She calls us retards.

307
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:36.764
"Retards." the B-word. the P-word.

308
00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:39.684
-She pulls up. she drives that truck.
-Right.

309
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.226
So she'll park it there.

310
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.979
Then she'll set her alarm off from inside.

311
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.356
That's what she said.
that she'll park her truck up here.

312
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.441
Then she'll come over.

313
00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:50.027
"You guys are getting near my truck.
you're touching my truck."

314
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.279
So. the last time she did it.
I told all the kids.

315
00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:53.781
I said… I was out here with my dog.

316
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:56.075
and I happened to see her pull there.
and they'll tell me.

317
00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.994
"Mom. she set the alarm off.
We did not do anything to her truck."

318
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.455
So this particular day.
I told them. I said.

319
00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:03.290
"Everybody come over here
and let's just see."

320
00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:07.503
And sure enough. just randomly.
like every six minutes.

321
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:10.172
the alarm would go off
and nobody's even over there.

322
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.716
So. I'm like. go back and play.
Then she'll come outside.

323
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.178
"Oh. you guys are near my truck.
This is private property."

324
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.181
Lady. they weren't even over there
and you're setting off the alarm.

325
00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:22.059
-Like. why don't you want kids to be kids?
-Just being mean.

326
00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.228
They're not terrorizing the neighborhood.

327
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.480
They're not ringing your doorbell
and running.

328
00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:27.856
They are playing football.

329
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.859
-They're not even messing with her.
-They're playing hide-and-go-seek.

330
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.319
-Like. seriously.
-Yeah.

331
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:36.156
Yes. ma'am.
I'll go let my partner know.

332
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.240
You know
what a devil's advocate is.

333
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.744
so that means I play both sides. right?

334
00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:44.623
So I got to think of
both aspects of every situation.

335
00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.959
So I was a kid once.
Everyone was a kid once.

336
00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:50.921
We're all loud as kids.
we like to yell and scream and fight.

337
00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:52.005
And so I get it.

338
00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:55.717
But when it's close to someone's house.
sure. it gets a little annoying sometimes.

339
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:59.221
I won't lie. okay? But if you guys
have permission to be over there.

340
00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:02.432
then. you know. I can't really
get on you guys too much.

341
00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:06.895
But if someone's going on her property.
which is just her porch. it's not okay.

342
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.189
I'm not saying you did.
She's claiming you did.

343
00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:12.818
I wasn't here to see it. so I can't… I
can't go one way or the other. all right?

344
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:15.279
She did have. like…
she has cameras. she records us.

345
00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:18.198
Yeah. okay. So…

346
00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:22.077
And I want you guys to run around.
hoot and holler all you can.

347
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.371
because I'd rather see you guys
outside playing

348
00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:26.874
than on them TikToks. all right?

349
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:31.295
If she starts screaming at you guys.
I want you to go tell an adult.

350
00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.797
Okay. I don't want you
to antagonize her. okay?

351
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:37.467
Because what happens is
when you guys antagonize her.

352
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.344
she can make you guys look bad.

353
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:42.681
And you guys are just
out here playing. right? Okay.

354
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:46.268
You guys understand everything. you kind
of get where I'm comin' from with that?

355
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.937
I want to make you guys
look like the good guys. okay?

356
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.814
-All righty.
-Thanks.

357
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.357
You're very welcome.

358
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:59.239
Mom said that
they were over here playing football.

359
00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.241
The old man. I guess. lives over here.

360
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:03.035
They said
he comes out and plays with them.

361
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.536
Yeah. He has no problem with kids.

362
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.663
-She's the only problem.
-Yeah.

363
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:08.749
'Cause they were saying.
they'll be outside playing.

364
00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.376
I was like. I get it. you guys are loud.

365
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.501
Like. yeah. sometimes.

366
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:13.045
-They're kids.
-Yeah.

367
00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:14.380
They're like. even if we're not.

368
00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.673
we'll just be sitting there.
and she'll scream at us.

369
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.927
And that's what Mom's said.
Nobody's even over there.

370
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.471
If the kids are just. like.
hanging out there in the open field.

371
00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.306
she'll just set the car alarm off.

372
00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.516
So she's just been…

373
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.228
I should get some Pop-Its for
New Year's and bring them back to them.

374
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.812
Right!

375
00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:33.899
-Y'all have a good evening.
-Thank you.

376
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.279
Psycho.

377
00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:42.867
It's an open field
for them to go play.

378
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.287
It's not an open field. It's two.
um. parcels that… one belongs to him.

379
00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:49.290
One belongs to the neighbor.
It's not an open lot.

380
00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:52.918
-So it doesn't even belong to you.
-I understand.

381
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:56.171
Okay. so we've instructed the kids
to not bother you.

382
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.172
Okay.

383
00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.050
Or if you come out
and you say something to them.

384
00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.344
they're supposed to go get their parents.

385
00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.180
What about her threat
that she's going to come

386
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.555
and drag my ass and beat me?

387
00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:09.393
Well. that's not what she said.
according to her.

388
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.520
Oh. no. Honest to God. she said that.

389
00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:14.606
Well. at the end of the day.
it's she said-she said.

390
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.817
On top of what the kids said.
the kids said

391
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.070
that you came out and you were
coming at them in an aggressive manner

392
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:22.072
and they thought
that you were going to hurt them.

393
00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:23.865
Oh. yeah. sure.

394
00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:27.536
I have to believe you.
but I also have to believe them.

395
00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.788
So. like I said.
it's all going to be documented.

396
00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.416
If you'd like a copy of the report.

397
00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:35.585
you can call the sheriff's office
and get documentation of it.

398
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.255
All right. Yeah. no. I would never. ever.

399
00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:39.673
Yes. ma'am.

400
00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:41.133
Unbelievable.

401
00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:43.886
So. like I said. if there's
any future problems. just give us a call.

402
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.971
-I instructed them to do the same.
-Okay. Okay.

403
00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:48.181
-Okay?
-Okay. Yeah.

404
00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:58.275
Is there issues
with this person? Like…

405
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:01.236
If you check history
on dispatch from her phone number.

406
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.946
this is nonstop.

407
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.907
Then she got an air horn.

408
00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.869
And she would open her door
and stand there.

409
00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.246
-Scared the hell outta me.
-Yeah.

410
00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:16.251
She would drive her pickup
and just go "Waaah!" Like. in the field.

411
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:20.297
And I mean.
she gunned her engine so hard.

412
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.758
I swear. I thought
one of these kids was hit.

413
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.092
I swear.

414
00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:26.511
And she just kept on
flying out the neighborhood.

415
00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:59.336
He pulls in.
and there's a lady in there ramming…

416
00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:02.422
like. just ramming the gate
back and forth with her truck.

417
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.758
I don't know.
she obviously must've got locked in.

418
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:08.136
but I don't know what
she was doing back there to begin with.

419
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.847
because this gate's always locked
and there's signs. you know?

420
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.891
One other time a guy got locked in here.

421
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:16.269
and he called me
and he got let out. you know.

422
00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.230
-All right.
-It's that simple.

423
00:23:18.313 --> 00:23:21.942
This isn't open to the public.
You have to register. and…

424
00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:23.944
All right.
well. give me one second.

425
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.333
2018 Nissan truck. gray. 1054…

426
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:40.252
Ah. she lives
right down the street.

427
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:34.181
-One minute!
-Jeez.

428
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.685
Sheriff's office.

429
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.481
What do you want?

430
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:44.107
-Are you Miss Susan?
-Yes. I am.

431
00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:45.942
Can you step out here for a second?

432
00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:48.028
-I was in bed.
-Okay.

433
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:55.869
-Hello.
-I am in a nightgown.

434
00:24:55.952 --> 00:24:58.330
Okay. I just have a couple of questions.

435
00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:00.916
My name is Deputy Paddock
with the Marion County Sheriff's Office.

436
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.585
-Okay.
-Where were you at today?

437
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:06.004
Um. here.

438
00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.047
-You were here?
-Yeah.

439
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.590
Is that your pickup truck out there?

440
00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:10.091
-Yes. it is.
-Okay.

441
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.886
I just have to read you something
before I ask anything else. okay?

442
00:25:12.969 --> 00:25:13.845
Okay.

443
00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:15.931
Did you let anybody
use your pickup truck today?

444
00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.224
-No.
-No?

445
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:21.394
And by your knowledge.
your pickup truck was here the entire day?

446
00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:23.939
I went out earlier today
because I had a flat.

447
00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.022
Okay.

448
00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:29.027
Do you mind just stepping out here
just for a second?

449
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.115
Okay. so I have to read you this

450
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.033
because I have to ask you
very direct questions.

451
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:36.034
-Okay.
-All right?

452
00:25:36.117 --> 00:25:37.077
You have the right to remain silent.

453
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.371
Anything you say can be used
against you in the court of law.

454
00:25:39.454 --> 00:25:42.541
You have the right to talk to a lawyer
and have him present while questioned.

455
00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:45.544
-If you can't afford to hire...
-Can I get something on? I'm freezing.

456
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:48.630
No. Come back.
Come back. No. no. no. no. no.

457
00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.340
Let me just get something on.

458
00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:53.510
Do you understand each of these rights
as I've explained them to you?

459
00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:54.427
Yes.

460
00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:56.138
Having these rights in mind.
do you wish to talk to me now?

461
00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:57.180
-No.
-What?

462
00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:58.765
-No.
-No?

463
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.850
Okay.

464
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:05.021
So. since you don't want
to talk to me.

465
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:08.275
what I'll have to do is
I'll go and find the truck driver

466
00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:09.484
that saw you there.

467
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:11.027
-Yeah.
-And do a photo lineup.

468
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:12.904
And then when he identifies you.

469
00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.990
the person is willing
to want to press charges.

470
00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.700
So I'll come back here.

471
00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:20.537
I've already asked you.
You told me you don't want to talk to me.

472
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.290
Anything else you say
I wouldn't be able to use at all.

473
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:25.917
So I'm not going to go forward with this.

474
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.545
If you don't want to talk to me.
that's fine. That's your choice.

475
00:26:28.628 --> 00:26:30.380
I didn't realize what it was. I'm sorry.

476
00:26:30.463 --> 00:26:35.135
You realize what it was because you
pretty much started saying it beforehand.

477
00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:37.012
And now you've said that you don't.

478
00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:38.972
I'm not going to do that.

479
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:42.517
Okay. I was taking medication.
That's why I didn't want to talk.

480
00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.311
I'm sorry. I panicked.

481
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:47.647
And then the guy locked me in there.
I thought…

482
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:51.026
I'm sorry. I've been previously raped
and beaten.

483
00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:52.777
And so I panicked.

484
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:54.070
I mean. I really panicked.

485
00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:56.073
And then I thought I was in trouble.

486
00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.949
Like. I thought
someone was going to harm me.

487
00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.493
Okay. So. here's the issue
that we're going to have.

488
00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:03.371
All right? He wants
somebody to pay for his gate.

489
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.415
because you severely damaged his gate.

490
00:27:05.498 --> 00:27:09.419
I also severely damaged my truck.
I'm not kidding. I just freaked out.

491
00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:11.921
Okay. well. I'll go down there
and talk to him. okay?

492
00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.507
-I was trying to get out.
-I getcha.

493
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:32.359
Susan.
she would come out and scream.

494
00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:36.488
And the language.
Around these little kids!

495
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:39.240
-That Susan would use?
-Yeah. Oh ho ho!

496
00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:42.369
Describe to me
what she was saying.

497
00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:45.121
The F-word. The B-word.

498
00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:47.332
B-word and F-word.

499
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.459
She called them slaves.

500
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:51.295
She told them
that the field that they were on

501
00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:53.880
wasn't the Underground Railroad.

502
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:58.134
Calling the little kids "niggers"
and all this and all of that.

503
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:08.228
Are you guys chasing
a dog around here?

504
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.021
Chasing a dog? What color is it?

505
00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.147
I don't know.

506
00:28:13.983 --> 00:28:14.985
What color is it?

507
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:18.238
You guys chasing a dog or trying
to put a dog into a car or something?

508
00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:22.117
-No. The Karen called.
-The Karen called.

509
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.118
She's saying…

510
00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:26.871
I don't know why she keeps
trying to waste her time.

511
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:28.707
The kids are just playing
around here. right?

512
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.208
Excuse me. He wants to talk to you.

513
00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:33.044
-She came out and started talking smack.
-And she flipped me off.

514
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:35.380
She's flipped him off.
because this is public space.

515
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.968
I dealt with this before.
let me go talk to this guy.

516
00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:46.015
-I just came outside.
-How you doing. sir?

517
00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:48.018
Nine times out of ten.
that lady probably called.

518
00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:49.018
I know.

519
00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:51.688
You know what I'm sayin'?
The kids always play.

520
00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:55.608
They always play over there. This man
over here say they can play in the grass.

521
00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:58.987
She's… I don't know if she's
schizophrenic. bipolar. I don't know.

522
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.613
Are these rentals or do you buy them?

523
00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:02.407
-Rentals.
-These are rentals?

524
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.452
So you can buy some.
I mean. I think she owns hers.

525
00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.663
But it doesn't even come
with property. does it? It's just a house.

526
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:08.580
I don't think so.

527
00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:11.624
-'Cause if it's a duplex. it wouldn't.
-She does it all the time.

528
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.126
Oh. I know. I've been here.

529
00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:15.628
I've been here when they were
playing tag and "trespassing."

530
00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:18.339
-She do it all the time.
-I'll go talk to her.

531
00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.054
I'm gonna go talk to her.

532
00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:26.765
Is she going to yell at us?

533
00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:29.184
She asks…

534
00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:34.689
Every time I walk past. she thinks
we're trying to steal her truck.

535
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:38.276
-Or by her truck!
-We're not even… We're 11!

536
00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:39.319
Okay. yeah.

537
00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:41.071
Do you even know how to drive?

538
00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:42.322
No!

539
00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:58.963
-Hello. How are you?
-Good. Is it Susan?

540
00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:00.799
-Yes.
-Okay. What's going on?

541
00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:04.260
The kid from across the street
and his little buddies.

542
00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:06.680
they are over here.
they're stepping on the signs and stuff.

543
00:30:06.763 --> 00:30:09.849
He brings out a puppy.
He wants to put his puppy in my truck.

544
00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:13.103
-I don't go for that.
-In the bed of your truck?

545
00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:14.270
-Yeah.
-Who?

546
00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:17.106
This little child who posed for me

547
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.400
because he thought
he was being so bloody cute.

548
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.321
That little child.

549
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.450
-He was the one that put the dog in?
-He was trying to.

550
00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:28.701
What kind of dog was it?

551
00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:30.912
-Just a little small dog.
-Okay.

552
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.415
She calls the police every day.

553
00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.293
You're acting
like a bunch of kids.

554
00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:38.753
-Yeah! 'Cause we are kids.
-I know.

555
00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:40.296
Duh!

556
00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.132
That's why we don't worry about it.

557
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.719
His mother has literally attacked me.

558
00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:48.638
Picked up the sign and threw it at me.

559
00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:51.975
I literally don't do anything over here.
I'm quiet.

560
00:30:52.058 --> 00:30:54.769
You know. I expect
my neighbors to be respectful.

561
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:55.895
Okay?

562
00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:58.731
I apologize
this happened as well.

563
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:01.568
-She not come to the door?
-She did.

564
00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:03.111
-I was trying to talk to her.
-Okay.

565
00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:06.155
Did you explain to her that
there doesn't need to be a call

566
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:09.409
every time a kid's playing
on the road or in the yard?

567
00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:11.703
Well. apparently.
they've been stomping…

568
00:31:11.786 --> 00:31:13.913
That one looks like
it's stomped out. too.

569
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:16.374
Apparently. they've been
stomping out her signs

570
00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.960
and running past her windows
and screaming

571
00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:21.588
and. like. ding-dong ditching her
and are knocking on the door.

572
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.840
There does come a point
where you kind of have to accept

573
00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:25.550
that you live with a bunch of kids.

574
00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:30.972
But she's also the only one
that ever calls.

575
00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:32.682
Yeah.

576
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.113
But this bossy one.
you need to take her to jail!

577
00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.574
-I ain't takin' her to jail.
-She's bossy!

578
00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:52.911
We're gonna take off.
but can you guys just do me a favor?

579
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:53.953
You're bossy! Bossy!

580
00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:56.665
Just keep an eye on your kids
and make sure they don't go over there?

581
00:31:56.748 --> 00:32:00.627
Because I think we all
appreciate not getting a bunch of calls

582
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.712
to come over here
over and over about nothing.

583
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.131
We all kind of know what the deal is.

584
00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:09.677
This is. like. six. seven times.
I think it's like twice a week.

585
00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:11.554
And you know what?

586
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:16.100
When I was growing up. I was doin' all
the same stuff that these kids were doing.

587
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:18.227
-Yeah.
-I was probably…

588
00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:21.022
Allegedly. Maybe. I don't know.

589
00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:25.610
I was probably bothering one of my
older neighbors that hated kids. you know?

590
00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:28.571
You know? I'm not saying it's right.

591
00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:29.781
Back in our day. though.

592
00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:32.367
if you were doing that.
they could just come out and threaten you.

593
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.328
-Yeah.
-Come out with the belt. you know?

594
00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:38.456
Yeah. Yeah.
But then you know what? You ran like hell.

595
00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:41.501
I come from the era
where your parents are so cool.

596
00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:44.045
and you got your ass whooped there.
and then you got…

597
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:45.964
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah. me too.

598
00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:50.051
I get it. I understand.
Like. they're kids.

599
00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:54.931
And that's why we don't… we don't
come out acting all crazy about it.

600
00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:57.850
We all… All the parents are cool.

601
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:02.146
I look out for them
just like I look out for my own.

602
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.941
Do you know what
that kid in the red shirt's name is?

603
00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:06.693
-Which one?
-The one right there.

604
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:09.529
-The little short one?
-Yeah.

605
00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:10.571
Ahh. Nope.

606
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:15.535
What's your… Afrika? Afrika?
What's your brother name?

607
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:18.454
My big brother? Isaac.

608
00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:22.792
Red shirt? Izzy.

609
00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:24.711
Does he have a little puppy?

610
00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:26.295
-Nah.
-Yes.

611
00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:29.048
She's saying he was trying to put the dog
in the back of the truck.

612
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:35.138
-In the back of the truck?
-You think he can even lift that dog?

613
00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:36.848
That dog is bigger than him.

614
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:41.352
The poodle is bigger than him.
Literally. Like. that dog is…

615
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:44.147
That dog stands this tall.
about this wide around.

616
00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:48.359
-He can't lift that dog.
-He can try.

617
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.407
Well. y'all need anything from us.
or are we good? Okay.

618
00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:00.496
See you guys.

619
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:02.874
Bye!

620
00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:07.795
All right. y'all have fun.

621
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.765
The neighbors and I would
all talk about well. why didn't she move?

622
00:34:18.848 --> 00:34:22.185
I said. when I moved in here.
she told me she was moving out.

623
00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:25.855
She kept
saying she was moving.

624
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:28.399
In March. in February.
and I was just wondering

625
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:30.109
why she ain't never got out of here yet.

626
00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:39.869
They just keep…
They're trespassing. trespassing.

627
00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:42.705
Called an officer out last night.
nobody shows up.

628
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:47.752
I guess the mother of the children
may have interceded.

629
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:49.295
She was out there waiting.

630
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:53.049
I mean. I just have
the burnt sign that they threw.

631
00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:55.343
I'm like. all right.
you're sending me a message.

632
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.677
Thank you so much.

633
00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:02.141
You want to see them go to jail.
or do some sort of recourse for it?

634
00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:04.685
Yes. absolutely.

635
00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.270
I like being honest with everybody

636
00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:09.398
so they know exactly
what's set down and done for them.

637
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.985
This is basically just gonna be
an official police document

638
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:16.572
because you don't have video proof…

639
00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:17.615
I know.

640
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:19.617
…of the arson and the criminal mischief.

641
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.788
So it will just be a police document.
more or less.

642
00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:31.462
Another day happened that

643
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:35.633
my friend told me that the lady over there

644
00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:39.554
showed the kids that she had a gun.

645
00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.391
We were just playing over there.

646
00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:46.269
and then she was waving her gun
and Isaac and all of them were like. run!

647
00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:48.521
And we were hiding
behind this car right here.

648
00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:51.733
And every time
the basketball would go up there.

649
00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.151
I would be on my P's and Q's.

650
00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:56.779
Like. 'cause I ain't trying to get shot
just for going on her driveway type shit.

651
00:35:58.281 --> 00:36:00.491
Maybe. like. two days before that?

652
00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.619
About two days
before she showed this gun?

653
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:04.745
Yes.

654
00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.500
What were you doing that day

655
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:10.835
during the daytime hours
when the sun was out on Friday?

656
00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:16.549
Well. me and my dad
and my friends were playing a game.

657
00:36:16.632 --> 00:36:19.302
She was taking pictures of us playing.

658
00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:22.180
Why is she recording us?

659
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:24.515
There's nothing to record!

660
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.733
Line up. let's go!

661
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:36.778
My little brother.

662
00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:40.072
he came and got me.
and he said the old. no offense.

663
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.783
but he said the old white lady outside is
acting crazy.

664
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.078
So I'm like. oh. damn. I'm like.
let me come see what that's about.

665
00:36:58.507 --> 00:37:00.676
So I was outside
playing basketball.

666
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.931
and I just see a pair of roller skates
flying at Izzy.

667
00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:09.477
So me and then Izzy came over here.
He said the woman had a tablet.

668
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.355
I guess the woman took it
and he came over there and said

669
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:14.815
she threw roller skates at him.

670
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.235
So me and Isaac went over there.

671
00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:21.197
And then she came out
and with the umbrella

672
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.742
and started swinging it.
and called us a jack A-S-S.

673
00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:28.704
Next thing I heard him say
was. "Izzy. go get Mom."

674
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.343
911. What is the address
of your emergency?

675
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:45.930
We got kids trespassing. standing
there. leaving all the toys around.

676
00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:49.934
just screaming. yelling.
just being absolutely obnoxious.

677
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.979
I went and threw the roller skates
over to the other side.

678
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:55.147
The kid says.
"I'm going to beat you up for that."

679
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.857
Is he out there right now?

680
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.943
Yeah. there are
several kids out there now.

681
00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.444
I'm fearing for my life.

682
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:02.321
I'm very scared.

683
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.117
Were there
any weapons involved?

684
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.326
No.

685
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.453
And the kid's saying I took his iPad

686
00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:12.123
and all this other shady shit
that isn't true.

687
00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:15.001
I don't like the kids threatening
me that they'll beat me up.

688
00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:17.128
that they're going to get
someone else to kill me.

689
00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.213
This is just ridiculous.

690
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.632
They just keep badgering me
and badgering me.

691
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:23.467
I'm just sick of these children.

692
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.762
Now that they're home from school.
it's like. you know.

693
00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:28.931
craziness.

694
00:38:30.182 --> 00:38:32.643
All right.
we do want you to avoid that person

695
00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.603
and then keep your doors
and windows locked.

696
00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:37.315
An officer will be dispatched
as soon as possible.

697
00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:39.734
Do you want the officer to contact you?

698
00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:40.693
Please. Yes.

699
00:38:40.776 --> 00:38:42.278
All right.

700
00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:43.988
Because what's going to happen is.

701
00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:45.740
his mom's gonna go
and wait for the officer.

702
00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:48.075
and run and say.
"Oh my God." I was threatening her kid.

703
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.827
Which just isn't true.

704
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.288
All right.
I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

705
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.373
but please call us back
if anything changes

706
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:57.793
or if you get any further information
or if they do leave. okay?

707
00:38:57.877 --> 00:38:59.128
Okay. thanks.

708
00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:04.967
Izzy's mom came outside.

709
00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.720
and then she started all mad.

710
00:39:07.803 --> 00:39:11.265
she started walking to.
to the lady's house.

711
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:16.103
and then she started banging on her.

712
00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:20.775
like. slide open door.
and then regular door.

713
00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:23.235
And it's not like

714
00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:25.488
somebody's throwing their body
against the door

715
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:27.865
trying to open it and just pounding on it.

716
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.117
Like I said. let me in.

717
00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:33.037
I hear knocking
like dun. dun. dun.

718
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.040
And then she didn't answer.
and then I hear her knocking again.

719
00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:38.959
but this time louder. like dun. dun. dun.

720
00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:43.756
Thud. thud. thud.
And as the thudding was going on.

721
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:47.718
a woman was screaming
like at the top of her lungs.

722
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.053
In a. like. mad voice.

723
00:39:49.136 --> 00:39:51.931
She said.
"Why did you take my son's tablet?"

724
00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:55.518
She said. "Come outside.
bitch." or something like that.

725
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:58.020
"I know you hear me outside. bitch."
Something like that.

726
00:39:58.104 --> 00:40:00.898
Where was the lady at.
the woman with the blonde hair?

727
00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:02.149
Where did she go?

728
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.193
She was inside her house.

729
00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:07.863
Did you hear
the blonde woman say anything at all?

730
00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:08.906
No.

731
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.200
Did this…
This one. two. three?

732
00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:12.868
Was this over a long or a short period?

733
00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:14.912
It was just
those literally two knocks.

734
00:40:14.995 --> 00:40:16.747
That's all she got was two knocks.

735
00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:18.457
And then bang!

736
00:40:23.879 --> 00:40:25.256
Call 911!

737
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:36.142
Hey. call 911!

738
00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:47.278
Please!

739
00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:49.447
She shot my mom!

740
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.575
-Who shot your mom?
-The Karen!

741
00:40:52.658 --> 00:40:54.118
With a freaking gun!

742
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.205
911. what is the address
of the emergency?

743
00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.332
I think somebody just got shot.

744
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:04.587
I heard one shot and everybody screaming
"Call the police. call the police."

745
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.048
I think somebody got shot.
Y'all boys stay over here!

746
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:11.177
Somebody call 911!

747
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.764
My neighbor has been
screaming at the kids outside.

748
00:41:15.848 --> 00:41:20.728
And all of a sudden. I heard
what to me sounded like a gunshot.

749
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.564
It's the old lady
that always calls the cops over here.

750
00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:26.233
It looks like
we're receiving multiple calls

751
00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:27.985
in reference to this also.

752
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:31.405
-911. what is the address?
-His mom got shot.

753
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:34.116
His mom got shot!
Hey. is your mom laying in the ground?

754
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.576
Yes!

755
00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:50.049
911. what's the address
of the emergency?

756
00:41:50.132 --> 00:41:53.636
1662 Southwest 107th Lane.

757
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:57.306
Oh my God. this lady just tried
to break down my door.

758
00:41:57.932 --> 00:42:00.309
I shot through the door.

759
00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:01.852
Oh my God!

760
00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:06.065
Okay. what is your name?

761
00:42:06.148 --> 00:42:07.983
Susan Lorincz.

762
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:11.946
Okay.
take a deep breath for me. calm down.

763
00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:16.283
I didn't know what to do.
I grabbed my gun and I shot at the door

764
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.494
and I thought she was gonna kill me.

765
00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:24.375
Did you know her?

766
00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:27.545
Yes.
She's come after me several times

767
00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:30.464
because of her children.
her children keep trespassing over here.

768
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.717
They're bothering me and bothering me.
They won't fucking stop.

769
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.347
Do you see the male
subject. or you just see the female?

770
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:40.683
Her boys were here earlier.

771
00:42:40.766 --> 00:42:43.519
They keep leaving their garbage
all around the house.

772
00:42:43.602 --> 00:42:45.563
And then I told them
to take the crap away.

773
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:47.398
get the fuck outta here.

774
00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.866
Wake up. Hey. wake up.

775
00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.995
Wake up. wake up. wake up.

776
00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:03.539
Come on. come on. Come on.

777
00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:07.918
-Wake up. Hey. wake up.
-Please!

778
00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.254
-What's going on?
-Please hurry and get here.

779
00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:12.381
Right here!
Right here! Right here!

780
00:43:13.048 --> 00:43:16.010
-And where...
-Right here! Right here!

781
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.558
She's on the ground.

782
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:25.853
Code one.
Marion Primary.

783
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.653
Hold on.

784
00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:36.655
Oh my God!

785
00:43:38.907 --> 00:43:41.910
-She got pulse. She said she's got pulse.
-Very faint. Very faint.

786
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.587
This lady's been planning
to do this for the longest time. bro!

787
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.668
-No exit.
-Baby. wake up!

788
00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:51.295
Still someone with a gun.

789
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:55.591
I have one down.

790
00:43:55.674 --> 00:43:58.927
I have one elderly female barricaded
in the house with a single zero.

791
00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:02.389
Wake up! Baby. wake up!

792
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:04.600
I'm up front. I'm up front.

793
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:08.103
Sheriff's office!
Come outside with your hands up!

794
00:44:09.563 --> 00:44:11.190
This is the Marion County
Sheriff's Office!

795
00:44:11.273 --> 00:44:13.025
Come outside with your hands up!

796
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.950
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands. Turn around.

797
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:24.662
Turn around. Where's your gun at?

798
00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:26.413
It's in my bedroom.

799
00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:28.666
I don't know what's going on.
You'll be detained for now.

800
00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:30.626
Is there
anybody else in the house?

801
00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:35.464
-Can I just get...
-No. Not right now.

802
00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:38.384
You're not under arrest.
You're being detained.

803
00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.010
Come over here.

804
00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:43.013
I'd like him to close the door.
I have two cats inside.

805
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:45.182
Female's detained. I need medics.

806
00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:47.184
Suspect's detained.

807
00:44:54.983 --> 00:44:58.529
Hey. med bag. get my med bag.
Start giving first aid.

808
00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:09.415
Mom!

809
00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:12.918
She needs medical aid.
Over there.

810
00:45:13.919 --> 00:45:15.379
It should be in the big black thing.

811
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:25.347
I said I gave my iPad to her…

812
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:27.183
If y'all were here
when it happened.

813
00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:28.809
just stand right here so I know
who was out here when it happened.

814
00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:30.728
She tried to throw skates at me.

815
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:33.897
All right. bud. Give me a minute.
Just hang out by my car. okay?

816
00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:44.533
-Where's she shot at?
-Right side of the chest.

817
00:45:46.452 --> 00:45:49.997
Have we been advised
if there's anybody else in the house?

818
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.667
We have a critical here.
we were advised…

819
00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:58.589
She's got a gunshot wound
to her right shoulder area.

820
00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:10.684
You ready?

821
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.523
Marion County Sheriff's Office!
If you're inside. make it known now!

822
00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.154
All right. we got three open doors.

823
00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:23.906
I'm going to clear the bathroom first.

824
00:46:24.406 --> 00:46:25.741
I have her kids.

825
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.955
Why would you shoot her?

826
00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:34.958
Hey. bitch! Hello?

827
00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:36.251
Why would you shoot her?

828
00:46:36.335 --> 00:46:38.003
Because she was threatening me.

829
00:46:38.837 --> 00:46:39.837
Clear in here.

830
00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.758
Clear in here.

831
00:46:44.927 --> 00:46:46.261
Safety sweep.

832
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.138
Back in the street.

833
00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:50.474
Everybody off the property.
onto the roadway.

834
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:06.615
Hey. there's
a little boy by my car.

835
00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:08.325
He's the one that was the primary witness.

836
00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:09.408
Okay.

837
00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:12.997
-She should have been in jail.
-She should have.

838
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.082
Get yo ass
in this house now. Let's go.

839
00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:15.999
Did you see him?

840
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:18.293
I didn't see him.
There's a little Black male.

841
00:47:18.377 --> 00:47:20.295
His mom is the one that got shot.

842
00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:23.006
I think he's over there.
Double check on that.

843
00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:26.552
This is supposed to be
one of the kids that saw it?

844
00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.395
I didn't see it.
but I have her kids.

845
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:29.680
Yeah.

846
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:31.974
-Where's Israel?
-Izzy. come here. baby.

847
00:47:32.057 --> 00:47:35.227
Hi. Izzy.
Come here. buddy.

848
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.188
Is she all right?
Is she all right?

849
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:40.774
They're doing
everything they can.

850
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.318
Is she moving?

851
00:47:43.402 --> 00:47:44.695
Is she moving?

852
00:47:44.778 --> 00:47:48.699
-Yes. she's moving.
-I want to see.

853
00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:50.493
She's going to the hospital.

854
00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:54.121
So that way they can take better care
of her than what I can do here. okay?

855
00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.164
At the hospital. they have
all the fancy machines

856
00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:58.292
and equipment
that we don't get in the field.

857
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.127
All right? So you can't see her right now.

858
00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.963
but as soon as we can.
we'll try to make that happen. okay?

859
00:48:05.632 --> 00:48:08.260
You're being so strong.
Very proud of you.

860
00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.971
So can you tell me what happened?

861
00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:14.433
So I was going to get my tablet
from over there

862
00:48:14.516 --> 00:48:16.268
because we was playing a game.

863
00:48:16.768 --> 00:48:19.062
She had my tablet.
I said. "Put down my tablet."

864
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:21.023
The lady
in apartment three?

865
00:48:21.106 --> 00:48:25.402
Yeah. she put it down and then
tried to throw the roller skates at me

866
00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:27.112
and then I got my brother.

867
00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:30.198
He said. "Throw the stuff at me.
throw the stuff at me."

868
00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:32.993
And then she called both of us
a jack A-word.

869
00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:37.456
And so I got my mother. she
kept on banging on the door. she shot her.

870
00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:41.306
All right. Are you hurt?

871
00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:44.922
-No. But my heart is broken.
-I know.

872
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:47.716
-I know. sweetheart.
-It's okay. baby.

873
00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:49.818
It's going to be okay.

874
00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.512
She's going to be okay.

875
00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:58.393
Hey. this is Deputy Stringer
of the Marion County Sheriff's Office.

876
00:48:58.477 --> 00:49:02.022
Is there any way you can come over here
to your ex's house with your children?

877
00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.774
'Cause they need somebody right now.

878
00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:07.611
Izzy. you good?

879
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.166
It's okay. honey.

880
00:49:31.593 --> 00:49:33.261
Hey. okay.

881
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.558
It's okay. It's all right.

882
00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:41.895
Daddy's here.
All right. Come here. Afrika.

883
00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.985
It's okay.

884
00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:50.904
The victim's children.

885
00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.116
Where's Titus?

886
00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:58.412
I haven't got any of that.
I was getting Afrika's information.

887
00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:03.959
Hey. sir. I just need to get your
information and stuff real quick. okay?

888
00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:00.307
Did y'all arrest the lady?

889
00:51:00.807 --> 00:51:02.851
She was arrested. Yes. sir.

890
00:51:09.274 --> 00:51:11.693
I'm gonna tell them. I'll tell them.

891
00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:19.910
How are you going to tell that lady.
her mom?

892
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:21.328
I don't know.

893
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:25.457
We'll just take it one step at a time.
You guys are all first. then we'll…

894
00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:33.924
That's Israel.

895
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:37.177
-Here is. uh. Izzy.
-Are you taking me?

896
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.180
I'm going to take you somewhere.

897
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.891
-Come on. Isaac.
-I'm sorry.

898
00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:53.527
-Y'all got the baby.
-Yeah. the baby. He is right here.

899
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.445
Just hold him one second.

900
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.322
Okay. All right.

901
00:52:13.046 --> 00:52:16.424
Today has been a very bad day.

902
00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:19.928
Yes. something bad has happened.

903
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:23.598
And all y'all seen it.
Y'all understand it.

904
00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:25.350
You all experienced it. right?

905
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:28.770
Okay. Y'all love me.

906
00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:31.439
Okay. We all love Mom.

907
00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:33.316
All right.

908
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.236
Well. I got some bad news to tell you.

909
00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:38.905
Mom's not coming back anymore.

910
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.449
Come. Uh-uh. Come. come. come.

911
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:43.994
No. no. no. Come here.

912
00:52:44.077 --> 00:52:49.166
Come over here. Listen to me.
No. no. I know.

913
00:52:49.249 --> 00:52:52.210
Okay. It's okay. I know.

914
00:52:52.752 --> 00:52:56.631
It's okay. I know. I'm sorry to tell you.

915
00:52:57.883 --> 00:52:59.843
I'm sorry.

916
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:05.473
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

917
00:53:05.557 --> 00:53:07.142
She can't go!

918
00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.902
It's all right.
You guys going to be okay.

919
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:20.989
It's all right.

920
00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.409
You guys are all right.

921
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.962
Israel. I love you.
I love you. baby.

922
00:53:36.755 --> 00:53:38.256
I'm so sorry. baby.

923
00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:45.722
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. baby.

924
00:53:46.598 --> 00:53:49.017
Come here. Izzy.

925
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.436
I love you. I'm sorry. my man.

926
00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:07.327
Why?

927
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:14.417
Oh my God.

928
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:16.419
It's her mom.

929
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.590
Just relax. Pam.

930
00:54:21.883 --> 00:54:23.969
At this point. there's nothing we can do.

931
00:54:41.236 --> 00:54:42.404
I'm sorry.

932
00:54:44.322 --> 00:54:45.907
I'm sorry.

933
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.334
-She didn't make it.
-Shut the fuck up.

934
00:54:59.754 --> 00:55:00.964
Hold on.

935
00:55:01.047 --> 00:55:02.841
She didn't make it.

936
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.763
Kingston. come here. She didn't make it.

937
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.105
It's okay. baby.

938
00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.111
I'm sorry. Isaac.

939
00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:33.997
Football. That's what
they play over there. Football.

940
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.545
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here
'cause I was freezing.

941
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:24.756
Oh. it is chilly in here. isn't it?

942
00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:25.924
-Susan?
-Yes.

943
00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:28.760
I'm Detective Stith.
This is Detective Peterson.

944
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:33.681
I'm trying to clarify all the events
that happened tonight

945
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:37.143
and to try to.
because really I only have.

946
00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:41.356
you know. statements from people
that were out there.

947
00:56:41.439 --> 00:56:43.733
And I would like
to get your side of things

948
00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:46.194
and try to understand
what exactly happened tonight.

949
00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:48.071
or last night now. I guess it is.

950
00:56:48.154 --> 00:56:50.281
Good gravy.

951
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:54.577
Basically. the neighbors
were out there screaming. yelling.

952
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:58.081
The kids were running back and forth.
I had a miserable headache.

953
00:56:58.164 --> 00:57:01.918
Went inside. laid down.
it finally got quiet.

954
00:57:02.001 --> 00:57:04.212
I came outside
and the three boys were there.

955
00:57:04.295 --> 00:57:06.798
I went. "Guys. you're trespassing.
come on. outta here."

956
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:09.134
And they were like.
"I'm going to tell my mom." you know.

957
00:57:09.217 --> 00:57:12.053
Go tell your mom.
I don't care. you know?

958
00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:15.056
-Have you had problems with them before?
-Oh my God. yes.

959
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.559
So. they go home.
and then all of a sudden. she comes out.

960
00:57:17.642 --> 00:57:20.603
and she is banging on my door
like. go away.

961
00:57:20.687 --> 00:57:23.148
I'm not dealing with you tonight.

962
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:26.526
And then she started banging so hard.
everything started shaking.

963
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.278
I'm like. "You really need to leave."

964
00:57:28.361 --> 00:57:30.238
And she's.
"I'm going to fucking kill you."

965
00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:34.534
And she's just banging away. banging away.
you know. and like …

966
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.828
And since she has actually harmed me.

967
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:40.665
It just keeps gettin' worse and worse.
I don't know what to do with her.

968
00:57:40.748 --> 00:57:43.501
She banged so hard. it looked like
my door is going to fly off.

969
00:57:43.585 --> 00:57:45.879
And that's. I just.
I panicked. and I was like.

970
00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:48.548
"Oh my gosh. she's really going
to kill me this time." you know?

971
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:51.509
And so… I don't even actually
remember picking up the gun.

972
00:57:51.593 --> 00:57:53.052
I just remember shooting.

973
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.972
How long do you think
she was hitting the door?

974
00:57:56.055 --> 00:57:59.017
I don't know. I can't even speculate
'cause it could've been seconds.

975
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.228
It could have been… You know. when
you get that fear response and you know…

976
00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:04.063
She banged on it. I was in the bathroom.

977
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.358
came out of the bathroom.
and she was still banging on it.

978
00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:08.151
So. I don't know. maybe a minute or two.

979
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:12.614
And you didn't try to call 911
back at that time?

980
00:58:12.697 --> 00:58:15.408
My phone wasn't there.
I didn't know where I put my phone.

981
00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:17.202
You don't remember
where you put your phone?

982
00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:19.621
No. I was like.
crap. I can't find my phone.

983
00:58:19.704 --> 00:58:22.916
Okay. So. but you had
already contacted 911.

984
00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:25.668
Did they advise you that
someone was responding?

985
00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:28.171
-An officer was responding?
-Yes. They said someone was coming.

986
00:58:28.254 --> 00:58:30.298
They said. "Lock the doors.
Don't go outside."

987
00:58:30.381 --> 00:58:32.675
I was like. okay. you know. usual.

988
00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:35.386
Okay. What was the deal
with the roller skates?

989
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:36.888
Because
we talked to a lot of people

990
00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:38.890
who were outside
and witnessed some of this.

991
00:58:38.973 --> 00:58:41.017
Oh. they keep leaving
all their toys around.

992
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.102
The other day.
I almost killed myself going out.

993
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.355
I had an early morning
doctor's appointment

994
00:58:45.438 --> 00:58:46.981
and I didn't see the roller skate.

995
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:50.276
And I almost killed myself and
I'm like. guys. you know. stop already.

996
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.155
This is not your garbage yard. you know.
and the kid's got his roller skates there.

997
00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:55.991
And I'm like. really.
take your roller skates.

998
00:58:56.074 --> 00:58:58.201
And I threw the roller skates
like. go fetch 'em.

999
00:58:58.284 --> 00:59:01.871
-You know. just. enough. because…
-Did you throw it at them?

1000
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:03.289
-Oh God. no.
-Okay.

1001
00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:07.210
Now what is the thing about the umbrella?
You had an umbrella?

1002
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.921
I thought it was raining
before and I walked out.

1003
00:59:10.004 --> 00:59:12.382
And it wasn't raining.
I'm like. okay. so…

1004
00:59:12.465 --> 00:59:16.427
Okay. And you. like. swung it at them
or something. or one of them?

1005
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:20.181
It wasn't even close.
I was still inside the vestibule.

1006
00:59:20.265 --> 00:59:21.683
How can we explain that then?

1007
00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:26.271
With people saying. like. multiple people
that weren't like talking to each other.

1008
00:59:26.354 --> 00:59:30.733
that if they were saying that
that's what they saw.

1009
00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.318
I don't know.

1010
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.071
Maybe I did step out.
and I'm like. guys. go away. go away.

1011
00:59:35.154 --> 00:59:37.865
-But I would never touch 'em.
-Okay.

1012
00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:40.076
Like. swat at them with it. but not…

1013
00:59:40.159 --> 00:59:42.912
Exactly. If I did.
it was probably because I was just so.

1014
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:44.455
you know. like. come on!

1015
00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:47.542
But I know if… if you did.
but is that what happened?

1016
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:49.877
I mean. we've got to
kind of get specific about this.

1017
00:59:49.961 --> 00:59:52.589
-Because it's a big deal.
-I understand.

1018
00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:55.383
-Someone's dead.
-Jesus Christ.

1019
01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.561
So that's why I say it's important

1020
01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:11.065
to be specific and honest
about. about. about everything.

1021
01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:17.155
As far as our training.
when we have to go through

1022
01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:18.781
making a judgment decision

1023
01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:22.035
where we have to…
might have to pull the trigger.

1024
01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:25.163
We have to know what we're firing at

1025
01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:28.958
is a deadly threat or what
we recognize as a deadly threat.

1026
01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:34.297
So. my question is.
how do you know what you're firing at

1027
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.634
when you're firing through a door
that you can't see through.

1028
01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:43.014
when you don't know if there's
also a child outside standing there?

1029
01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:45.767
Or. I mean. basically. I'm asking you.
what were you aiming at

1030
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.187
and what were you intending to do
when you fired that gun?

1031
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:54.442
I was just fearful of my life.
I was just like. go away. go away.

1032
01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:57.028
That's all I could think of. was just
get out of the situation.

1033
01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:58.988
you know. just go away already.

1034
01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:02.700
Is there anything else
that you can think of

1035
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:07.288
that I didn't ask or that might be helpful
for figuring this all out?

1036
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:11.000
I've never been in this situation before.

1037
01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.586
This is all new.
and it's… it's killing me.

1038
01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:19.425
Okay. All right. Susan.
give me just a minute.

1039
01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.094
And I'll be right with you. okay?

1040
01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:52.542
Susan.

1041
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:57.213
All right. I talked to the State Attorney.

1042
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.882
the prosecutor
for the State Attorney's office.

1043
01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:03.970
They are along the same lines
of what we're thinking.

1044
01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.597
We're going to continue the investigation.

1045
01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:12.061
I don't think it's safe
for you to go back to that house.

1046
01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.896
I don't think so either.

1047
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:19.902
But what we can do
is provide you with a ride back there.

1048
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:31.497
You're going to gather
some of your things and go to a hotel.

1049
01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:32.749
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

1050
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.208
Thank you.

1051
01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.968
Several days after
the mother was shot and killed

1052
01:02:44.051 --> 01:02:45.386
in front of her young children.

1053
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:49.140
her family is demanding
the shooter be arrested and charged.

1054
01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:50.516
This. while the sheriff says

1055
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.352
he's dedicated
his best detectives to the case.

1056
01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.937
adding he. too. would be upset

1057
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:58.149
if someone threw an object
at or towards his kids.

1058
01:02:58.232 --> 01:03:02.320
Somebody threw something
at my child. I'd be pissed off.

1059
01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:04.947
Marion County
Sheriff Billy Woods.

1060
01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.241
saying his detectives are still

1061
01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:08.993
in the early stages
of conducting interviews.

1062
01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:12.330
Are you aware
that someone was shot?

1063
01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.957
Yeah. yeah. And that…

1064
01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:21.547
I never expected that but it doesn't
surprise me because she was a live wire.

1065
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.424
-Who is that?
-Susan.

1066
01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.679
The lady that was shot.
was she a Black lady?

1067
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.600
She lived right across the street.

1068
01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:36.270
She was always very nice to me.
Is she okay?

1069
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.774
-Or did she pass?
-I can't really say.

1070
01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:43.945
I could tell by your eyes.
And she's got little kids.

1071
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.533
Knowing that
your friend is gone for life.

1072
01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:52.620
Knowing her babies won't
kiss her at night. that hurts.

1073
01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:55.748
Oldest two boys. they feel guilty.

1074
01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:59.836
I mean. one stated that
if he had never left his tablet behind.

1075
01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.505
that his mother would still be here.

1076
01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:08.594
First oldest feels guilty because he
wasn't able to perform CPR on his mom.

1077
01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.555
You know.
no child should feel like. you know.

1078
01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:14.725
I couldn't save someone.
let alone their mom.

1079
01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:23.818
I'm just hurt and. like.
almost feeling a little guilt.

1080
01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:29.824
And I'm telling her to just leave it alone
when it's just festering

1081
01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:34.412
and building with this woman
or giving her more time

1082
01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:38.833
and. you know. opportunity
to do what she did.

1083
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.627
Family members say

1084
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.713
Owens' neighbor who fired the gun
should be arrested for murder.

1085
01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:49.302
As a mother.
the protector of her children.

1086
01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:53.639
she wanted to know why this happened.

1087
01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:59.270
All right. Susan. I put
all those items in your purse. okay?

1088
01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:00.229
Okay.

1089
01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.523
They're on the hood of the car.

1090
01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:02.606
Okay.

1091
01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:08.279
Again. we're just trying
to make sure you're safe and everything.

1092
01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:10.781
-Understood.
-But just please call…

1093
01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.825
I'm going to give you a key to my house.

1094
01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.160
And it's a spare that I have.

1095
01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:17.663
Will you please lock
both top and bottom. all right?

1096
01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:34.180
-No justice…
-No peace!

1097
01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:44.857
A mother has lost her life
for being a mother.

1098
01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.692
Where is the justice in that?

1099
01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.985
No peace!

1100
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.069
Nothing changes!

1101
01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:52.949
Marion County
has become a national focus tonight

1102
01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:56.786
after the shooting of a Black woman
by her white neighbor last Friday.

1103
01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:58.245
Many people today protested

1104
01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:01.582
the lack of an arrest
in the shooting of Ajike Owens.

1105
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.976
Everybody should
watch out for glass.

1106
01:06:20.601 --> 01:06:23.229
It's dangerous in Aunt Susie's house.

1107
01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:26.524
Yeah. this doesn't mean
they get to break her shit.

1108
01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:29.944
No.
but I also can't prove who did it.

1109
01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:32.279
Which is kind of the problem.

1110
01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.618
Sorry. One cat to go and then I'm done.

1111
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.208
Guns are very dangerous.

1112
01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:48.295
Well. yeah. sadly.
they made quite a mess.

1113
01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.881
And I…

1114
01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:56.012
I cleaned it up the best I could.

1115
01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:01.434
Sorry. I just need to get him
and we can leave.

1116
01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.395
Thank you so much for doing this.

1117
01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:05.938
Yeah. Of course.

1118
01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.068
Y'all drive safe.

1119
01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:21.328
Justice for AJ!
Justice for AJ!

1120
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.664
Justice for her children!

1121
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.042
Justice for her community!

1122
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.794
Marion County
Sheriff Billy Woods

1123
01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.754
has said he cannot make an arrest

1124
01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:32.215
while the sheriff's department
investigates whether this meets

1125
01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.467
the criteria of Florida's
Stand Your Ground law.

1126
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.927
Florida has a Stand Your Ground law

1127
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.722
that permits the use of deadly force
if there is a presumption of fear.

1128
01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:42.141
When is it okay in America

1129
01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.685
to shoot someone behind a locked door?

1130
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:49.565
We need answers. We need an arrest.

1131
01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:51.734
There's evidence that's being gathered.

1132
01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:54.737
There are things being looked at.
There are warrants being executed.

1133
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.572
She's supposed to be in jail.

1134
01:07:56.655 --> 01:07:58.908
It's important to wait
for the evidence to come back.

1135
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.078
We understand that process. but why
isn't she in jail while this process…

1136
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:06.999
Because if it was us. we would be in jail
while y'all doing this process.

1137
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:11.128
They got to my dishes. Nice.

1138
01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:16.050
-They're screaming over there.
-I know. I can hear 'em.

1139
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:18.302
Treat that little boy
the way you treat our kids.

1140
01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:20.596
I'm going to go talk to them.
Can y'all stay over there?

1141
01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.101
Just don't talk to them.

1142
01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.269
-I know you're upset. okay?
-Everybody's upset.

1143
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.773
She's going to end up in jail.
so it don't matter. but everybody's upset.

1144
01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:32.066
Listen. I'm going to be honest.

1145
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.610
She shouldn't even be in the street.
She murdered this lady.

1146
01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:36.195
Okay. listen. I'll be honest with you.

1147
01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:39.365
I'm here because she called me up.

1148
01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.617
Because she knows better
than to be out here alone.

1149
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.079
That's why she gots people with her.
Because she knows.

1150
01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.539
Okay. but listen. Listen to me.

1151
01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.249
See what happened to the lady house?

1152
01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.417
Just make my life
a little bit easier. okay?

1153
01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:52.211
-Your life easier?
-I'm not...

1154
01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.381
Make your life easier?
You fucking kidding me?

1155
01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:58.342
I'm not here to start anything with you.
or to start anything with her.

1156
01:08:58.425 --> 01:09:00.594
Okay? You guys don't need to be
arguing in the street.

1157
01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:05.266
She ain't
gonna come to the street!

1158
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:09.770
Sat in her fucking house. didn't even
open the door and shot through it!

1159
01:09:14.525 --> 01:09:15.609
You're disgusting!

1160
01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.367
-You up?
-Yeah. I am.

1161
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.452
Mine's turned off.
I should probably turn it on.

1162
01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:34.128
They were here earlier.

1163
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.217
Dumb fucking bitch!
Look at that bitch.

1164
01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:51.886
She gets to fucking...

1165
01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:03.115
It's just as cold in here.

1166
01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.910
-All right. Give us just a couple minutes.
-Okay.

1167
01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:08.662
Detective Ryan Stith.

1168
01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:11.624
the date is Tuesday. June 6. 2023.
at 8:31 p.m.

1169
01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:15.419
I'm gonna attempt an interview
at the Marion County Sheriff's Office

1170
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.256
Central Operations Complex
with Susan Lorincz.

1171
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.433
Okey do key.

1172
01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:37.191
Susan. I appreciate
you coming back in and talking with us.

1173
01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:41.070
Some of the things. like I said.
we're just trying to clarify.

1174
01:10:41.153 --> 01:10:42.153
That's fine.

1175
01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:45.116
Has anything like this ever
happened to you before.

1176
01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:48.953
where someone was trying to break
into the house and hurt you or something?

1177
01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.455
-No. not like this.
-No. nothing like that.

1178
01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:53.582
Nothing like that's
ever happened to you before.

1179
01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.751
I just wanted to see
if there was a similar experience.

1180
01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:57.711
We talked about unreported sexual abuse.

1181
01:10:57.795 --> 01:10:59.255
We talked about domestic violence.

1182
01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:02.925
We talked about whenever you were robbed
once of something by some men.

1183
01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:05.511
But then we're talking about
what happened there today.

1184
01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:09.265
And this woman. that…
that she passed away.

1185
01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.017
You said that she had…
you guys had yelled at each other

1186
01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.603
three or four times in about
a year and a half to two years.

1187
01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:15.687
-Is that right?
-Yes.

1188
01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:19.692
Is there any reason why anybody
would have any video or anything like that

1189
01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:22.736
of you saying. like. the N-word?

1190
01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.822
Or is there any reason
why someone would have that?

1191
01:11:24.905 --> 01:11:27.700
I have no idea.
And if I did let it go. I'm sorry.

1192
01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.785
I mean. it could have slipped out.

1193
01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:36.000
What… be honest. What context
would it slip out. you think?

1194
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.627
I mean. what would happen
for you to say something like that?

1195
01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:42.548
Um. if they were being extraordinarily
rude. or if they were just…

1196
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.217
I was always taught
the N-word meant that

1197
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:50.222
you were just being unlawful.
you know. dirty.

1198
01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.809
I don't know.
generally not being pleasant.

1199
01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:58.230
When Ajike was at the door.
how many times did she…

1200
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:03.110
-Was it just like. one. or was it several…
-No. it was bang. bang. bang.

1201
01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.779
Okay. All right. And then you said…

1202
01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:09.533
You said you asked her. who's there?
Okay. And what was said then?

1203
01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:14.705
Good gravy. I think she said. "Why do you
speak to my children this way?"

1204
01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:18.250
And I said. "Listen.
I'm not going to speak to you. go away."

1205
01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:21.003
You know. if she had a problem.
she should have called you guys.

1206
01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:24.590
Honestly. I mean. if she really thought
there was something seriously wrong.

1207
01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.508
I don't understand why she just came over

1208
01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:30.554
and just started pounding on my door
and. you know. screaming and yelling.

1209
01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:33.599
And then what happened.
after you said to go away?

1210
01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.601
Go away. and then it got quiet for a bit.

1211
01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:39.104
And then she started really banging.
you know. just pounding on that door.

1212
01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.064
She was relentless.

1213
01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:44.735
How long is a bit. would you say?
Like. five or ten seconds or two minutes?

1214
01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:47.321
It was a…
it was an extended period of time.

1215
01:12:47.404 --> 01:12:49.865
-Probably 20 to 30 seconds. easily.
-Okay.

1216
01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.077
All right. And then when it became silent.

1217
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.372
at that first round
of beating on your door.

1218
01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.540
where did. where were you at then?

1219
01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:03.170
-Did you go…
-I went to wash my hands. honestly.

1220
01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:05.756
Because I didn't know who was at the door
and I wanted to know.

1221
01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:07.466
-And then I was…
-Okay.

1222
01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:09.760
-So I went back and washed my hands.
-Okay.

1223
01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.304
So that's during the time
where it was kind of quiet.

1224
01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.098
you thought that maybe she went away.

1225
01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.057
Okay.

1226
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.559
You were washing your hands
in the bathroom.

1227
01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.645
and then the pounding
and the yelling started again.

1228
01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:22.231
and you went to the kitchen.
what were you doing in the kitchen?

1229
01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:24.024
I was looking for my phone.

1230
01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:27.111
I put my phone down somewhere.
and I started panicking.

1231
01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.862
I started searching for the phone.

1232
01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.781
and then she just kept
banging and banging.

1233
01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:33.200
"I'm gonna kill you."
You know. "Get out of here!"

1234
01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:35.411
You know. like… I have nowhere to go.

1235
01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:38.163
I mean. I was in the kitchen.
there was the sliders.

1236
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.458
and the sliders are always locked
and just that one door.

1237
01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:43.127
So there's no escape. I couldn't leave.

1238
01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.254
I couldn't get out of there.
I was like. Jesus Christ.

1239
01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:48.424
And she was pounding so hard.
the mirror on my wall was shaking.

1240
01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.801
Okay. when she started
pounding on the door again

1241
01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:54.763
and saying all that stuff
to the point where you fired the gun.

1242
01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:57.057
how long do you think that that lasted?

1243
01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.519
-Two to five minutes.
-Two to five minutes.

1244
01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:02.938
Everything's kind of… it was a while.
I mean. it was a while.

1245
01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:05.024
I kept thinking. okay.
you guys are going to show up.

1246
01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.776
you know. because I called earlier
and no one was coming.

1247
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.320
No one was coming. I'm like. shit.
Couldn't find my phone.

1248
01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.906
And she was just banging and banging.
screaming at me.

1249
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.450
Telling me. "I'm gonna kill you."

1250
01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.536
I'm like. she's really going to kill me
this time. That's all I kept thinking.

1251
01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.164
she's literally going
to come in this house and kill me.

1252
01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:21.290
Let me ask you this.

1253
01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:24.209
Maybe this can kind of help us
get a better time frame.

1254
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.128
From the time that you called 911.

1255
01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:30.174
"These kids are on my property again.
They are yelling." You know…

1256
01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:34.303
What happened that first 911 call.
that time that you hung up with 911?

1257
01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:38.307
How long before she showed up and she was
pounding on the door after you hung up?

1258
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.351
-Ten minutes.
-Ten minutes? Okay.

1259
01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:44.062
So about ten minutes
after you disconnected.

1260
01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:47.107
and they said.
"Hey. we have deputies on the way…"

1261
01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:51.028
Ten minutes after that is when
she started pounding on your door.

1262
01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:54.907
If we were to look through
everything in your phone.

1263
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:58.118
or your home desktop computer.
is there anything.

1264
01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.829
kind of research
on your internet history that would show

1265
01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.706
that you've done research
on like self-defense?

1266
01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:05.125
-Ever heard the term Stand Your Ground?
-Yes.

1267
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:07.503
Have you ever done
any kind of research on that?

1268
01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:09.963
Yes. when it was mentioned on...

1269
01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:14.968
Some guy shot someone
at a convenience store.

1270
01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:18.138
and they said Stand Your Ground laws.

1271
01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:19.848
-Was that like a Florida situation?
-Yes.

1272
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:22.100
'Cause I know every state
has kind of different laws.

1273
01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.853
-I think it was Florida.
-Okay.

1274
01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.939
-And when was that?
-God. years ago.

1275
01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:29.191
-That was years ago?
-Yeah. that was years ago.

1276
01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:32.736
So. nothing recent that would be
on like your internet browser history?

1277
01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:34.738
-I looked at it today.
-You looked at it today?

1278
01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:37.449
'Cause that's when I was on Facebook.

1279
01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:41.119
Just some things that.
they had it up on Facebook.

1280
01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.790
Susan. I think you know
the reason why I'm asking that question.

1281
01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.292
You're smart. okay?

1282
01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.378
-And the reason is...
-Oh. hell no.

1283
01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:51.547
No. absolutely.
I know what you're thinking.

1284
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.049
Did I look up the laws
so I could do something?

1285
01:15:54.132 --> 01:15:54.967
No. Absolutely not.

1286
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.386
This is not a situation
where you set something up

1287
01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:59.429
because you were tired of this person?

1288
01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:02.182
You were tired of the situation
that they had put you in.

1289
01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.018
We kind of went through
your first interview.

1290
01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:06.395
and in that first interview.
you had even said to the kids.

1291
01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:09.606
-"You know what? Go get your mom."
-No. I didn't.

1292
01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:11.942
You said something along the lines of

1293
01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:13.736
when they said.
"I'm going to go get my mom…"

1294
01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:16.071
-You said. "Go get her."
-"Go get her."

1295
01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:17.990
Which is fine.
I'd want to talk to an adult too.

1296
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.075
I don't want to talk to a kid.

1297
01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:21.410
I don't remember saying that.

1298
01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:23.120
So when someone calls 911.

1299
01:16:23.203 --> 01:16:26.832
as soon as that call goes
to our communication center. it logs it.

1300
01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:29.918
Gives us a time stamp.
Hour. minute. second

1301
01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:32.879
from the very first time
that call was received

1302
01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:34.965
to the time it's disconnected. okay?

1303
01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:37.384
And that's for every single time
someone calls.

1304
01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:38.969
So the first time when you called 911

1305
01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:42.681
talking about the boys out there
trespassing and things of that…

1306
01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.684
-So. that call started at 8:54 p.m.
-Mm-hm.

1307
01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.060
Does that sound about right?

1308
01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.938
Yes. I really wasn't looking at the clock.

1309
01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:51.315
I just remember calling.

1310
01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:53.400
That's what time it says
on our call center.

1311
01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:58.655
And the call lasted for five minutes
and it disconnected at 8:59.

1312
01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:01.158
Deputies were on the way. Okay.

1313
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.576
Now. you estimated

1314
01:17:02.659 --> 01:17:06.246
that it was approximately ten minutes
after you disconnected

1315
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:09.291
until AJ started pounding on your door.

1316
01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:11.168
Is that correct? Is that right? Okay.

1317
01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:16.256
So. the second 911 call where you called.
"Lady was banging on my door."

1318
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.676
"I shot her through the door."
That call came into our call center.

1319
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.971
It was received at 9:01.
which is two minutes after you hung up

1320
01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.974
with the communication center
the first time.

1321
01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:28.101
So that's two minutes
that all these things

1322
01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.520
that you say occurred
happened at your front door.

1323
01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:34.775
From pounding and pounding and pounding.
"I'm going to kill you." all these things.

1324
01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:39.363
within two minutes.
she showed up at your front door.

1325
01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:42.908
and did all these things
to the time that you pulled the trigger.

1326
01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:45.827
went and found your phone
and then called 911.

1327
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:48.455
So… and that's why I'm trying to get…

1328
01:17:48.538 --> 01:17:50.332
To me. it seemed like that amount of time.

1329
01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:52.334
That's why I thought
it was that amount of time.

1330
01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:53.794
Well. so clearly. we've established

1331
01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:56.171
that that was not true.
that that's not the case.

1332
01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:58.215
But that's what you felt it was.

1333
01:17:58.298 --> 01:18:01.343
So you also told me that
that's what you heard.

1334
01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:03.095
that she was going to kill you.

1335
01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.597
Is it possible that she did not say that.

1336
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.599
and that's what you heard or you believe.

1337
01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.435
just like you believed there was
ten minutes between those calls?

1338
01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.605
I just thought she said.
"I'm going to kill you."

1339
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:14.731
Are you the Susan

1340
01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:17.401
that has done research on
Stand Your Ground

1341
01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:20.737
and has planned for this to happen.
was planning for this to happen?

1342
01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.740
There's a spectrum here.
Is this the Susan over here?

1343
01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.535
And then there's also…
could be a Susan over here

1344
01:18:26.618 --> 01:18:32.332
that was. "I have a gun in the house.
I'm scared.

1345
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:36.211
someone is knocking on the door.
I'd like them to go away."

1346
01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:39.298
"I'm just going to… Oh. I picked up
the gun and I accidentally shot the gun."

1347
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.300
There's a Susan
somewhere in the world like that.

1348
01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.260
You've somehow found a spot in the middle

1349
01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:47.055
where you're trying to explain this.
but it doesn't actually make any sense.

1350
01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:50.308
So this is your opportunity
to actually tell us

1351
01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:51.810
that something that does make sense.

1352
01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:54.938
I'm not going to hold it against you.
I'm not going to get mad.

1353
01:18:55.021 --> 01:18:59.443
But whenever AJ was coming over
that evening…

1354
01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:01.945
What… what happened? What happened?

1355
01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:04.698
Bring me to that moment
when you had the gun in your hand.

1356
01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:06.283
What were you thinking?

1357
01:19:06.366 --> 01:19:08.118
All I wanted her… was to go away.

1358
01:19:08.201 --> 01:19:11.621
I just. you know. I felt she was gonna
come through that door and kill me.

1359
01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.540
I'm sorry. That's what I felt.

1360
01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:17.002
I just felt she was going to come
through the door and kill me.

1361
01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.463
It was a tremendous fear.

1362
01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:22.215
-Do you feel bad for what happened?
-Oh. Christ. yes.

1363
01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:26.428
Let me ask you this.
You said that you went on Facebook today.

1364
01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.723
I can only imagine that
at some point you may have seen

1365
01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:32.809
some of the news
dealing with this case and this story.

1366
01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.437
-Yes.
-Okay. What kind of stuff did you see?

1367
01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.105
I threw a tablet at the child.

1368
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:40.692
I said all kinds of things
that I never said.

1369
01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:42.402
You know what I saw?

1370
01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:45.655
I saw four kids
that no longer have a mother.

1371
01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:52.746
And… I'm not taking away
how you were treated.

1372
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:57.042
But those are children nonetheless. right?

1373
01:19:57.542 --> 01:20:00.045
And now they don't have a mother
to go home to.

1374
01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:05.467
And I think you know
what you did was wrong.

1375
01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:12.098
I think you know that there were already
deputies on the way.

1376
01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:16.436
But there were times I called
and deputies never showed up.

1377
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.939
I understand. It's been two minutes. so…

1378
01:20:19.022 --> 01:20:20.357
To me. it wasn't two minutes.

1379
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.276
To me. it was much longer.
In my mind. it just felt like…

1380
01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.906
But there's only one reality
where time exists.

1381
01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:31.493
and I understand perception of time
can be different for different people.

1382
01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:34.830
But in the reality of things.
you had just disconnected.

1383
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:39.125
Within two minutes.
a shot was fired through that door.

1384
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:43.964
There's no way
to justify that in my mind.

1385
01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:46.508
I don't think in Detective Pinder's mind

1386
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:49.719
and clearly in other people's minds
that we discussed this case with.

1387
01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:52.472
the State Attorney. our legal counsel.
and things like that.

1388
01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:54.641
So. I mean…

1389
01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.562
At this point.
we've discussed it with the state

1390
01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:02.107
and they are on the same terms

1391
01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:05.068
as far as charging you with manslaughter.

1392
01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:06.653
-Okay?
-Okay.

1393
01:21:07.153 --> 01:21:10.657
I don't know what to say.
just… I was in fear for my life.

1394
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.994
I mean. honest to God. I just feared
she was going to come through that door.

1395
01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:15.954
I'm sorry. That's how I felt.

1396
01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:20.917
I can't change the way I felt.
I mean. it was sheer terror on my part.

1397
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.712
I mean. honest to God.
I was like. I was shaking.

1398
01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.340
So. one of the things I want to ask.

1399
01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:31.720
because at the point where I did let you
know and informed you. you know. what…

1400
01:21:31.803 --> 01:21:35.390
What had ultimately happened to AJ
after that shooting.

1401
01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:37.058
you know. that she had passed away.

1402
01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.978
And obviously. she has four kids.

1403
01:21:41.354 --> 01:21:44.232
And. you know.
I was observing the interviews

1404
01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.151
that were conducted with them

1405
01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:48.653
and the emotions
that they were going through.

1406
01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.406
And you shared
some of those same emotions

1407
01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:54.451
at points through
the conversations that we had.

1408
01:21:54.534 --> 01:21:58.246
And I just want to. like.
obviously. I can't let you talk to them

1409
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:02.375
or give a message to them.
like. face-to-face.

1410
01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:06.630
But I would like. it's up to you
if you would like to write them a letter

1411
01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:12.552
or something to kind of. you know.
whatever's on your mind or in your heart.

1412
01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:13.553
You don't have to.

1413
01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.931
We're just going to
leave a notepad and a pen in the room.

1414
01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.641
Obviously. we have some paperwork to do.

1415
01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:20.101
so we're going to have
to step out for. to do that.

1416
01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.562
and obviously talk to our boss.

1417
01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:29.235
I offer it to everybody.
that we can't let them talk to.

1418
01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:32.072
-So it's just something we do.
-I understand.

1419
01:22:32.572 --> 01:22:34.240
So. if you'd like to do that.

1420
01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:37.202
We're going to get
that paperwork going like he said.

1421
01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.788
But that's where the state's at right now.
that's where we're at.

1422
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:42.332
I'll talk to you a little bit more
about that in just a minute.

1423
01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:46.336
But if you'd like to write on something.
it's right there. okay?

1424
01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.845
All right. Susan. All right. we're going
to have you go with this deputy here.

1425
01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:21.473
-No.
-I'm sorry?

1426
01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:22.515
-No.
-No. what?

1427
01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:24.642
-I can't.
-What's wrong? What's goin' on?

1428
01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.604
I just can't. I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1429
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.568
I mean. we're. unfortunately.

1430
01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:37.530
we're to that point where
that's what's going to happen.

1431
01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:41.201
Obviously. this isn't a conviction.

1432
01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:42.952
This is you being charged.

1433
01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:45.413
and then you're going
to have your day in court

1434
01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:48.792
to present your side of the story.

1435
01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:52.170
Okay. so you're
going to go with this deputy.

1436
01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:53.129
No. I'm not.

1437
01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:54.923
-You're going to be booked in.
-No. I'm not.

1438
01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:57.092
-And fingerprinted.
-No.

1439
01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:59.052
They're going to take your pictures

1440
01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:02.263
and then you will have
an arraignment in the morning.

1441
01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:05.391
I'm not going. I'm sorry.

1442
01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:07.143
There's a phone down there.

1443
01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:09.062
You'll be able
to call whoever you need to call.

1444
01:25:09.145 --> 01:25:10.897
-Right there in booking.
-I'm not going.

1445
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:15.527
But. um… Susan. you… we are going.

1446
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:19.072
There's no changing that now.
You're under arrest.

1447
01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:21.991
In fact. we can probably go ahead
and put handcuffs on her.

1448
01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:23.827
Let's get you handcuffed.

1449
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:26.121
-Stand up.
-No. Don't touch me.

1450
01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:28.540
-Stand up. Susan.
-No. No. Sorry. I can't.

1451
01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:32.043
It can go one of two ways. It can go
an easy way or a really hard way.

1452
01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.004
-I'm sorry.
-We don't want it to go the hard way.

1453
01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:36.339
-I'm so sorry.
-Susan. put yourself in our position.

1454
01:25:36.422 --> 01:25:39.050
There's no choice in this.
You're going over there.

1455
01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.177
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1456
01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:43.596
Susan. you understand that

1457
01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.100
from the point
of the story that you've given us.

1458
01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:54.065
that by refusing and resisting.
that it's making you look bad. okay?

1459
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:57.277
I'm sorry. I don't feel good.
I can't do this.

1460
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.529
Okay. well. they have
medical staff over there.

1461
01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:01.990
-So they can assist you.
-There is a nurse right in the front.

1462
01:26:02.073 --> 01:26:04.742
You give them the prescription medications
that you're taking.

1463
01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.327
all of that. they will assist you

1464
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.413
in making sure that
you get the care you need.

1465
01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.499
-No. I can't do this.
-We're going over there. okay?

1466
01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:12.626
-You're going to go over there.
-I just can't do this.

1467
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:15.044
-Okay. well…
-Come on. Susan. stand up.

1468
01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:17.130
-We don't have time to debate.
-I can't do this.

1469
01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:19.757
Okay. but you understand
that you're under arrest

1470
01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.385
and you're going to be taken
to the jail one way or another. okay?

1471
01:26:22.468 --> 01:26:23.803
-I don't care.
-Susan.

1472
01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:26.055
I just can't do this. I'm sorry.

1473
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:30.685
What you're saying
and doing right now is not reasonable.

1474
01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:31.644
I know it's not.

1475
01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.938
-There's been people…
-I just can't do this.

1476
01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:37.817
When you say you know it's not reasonable.
that doesn't make sense to me.

1477
01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:40.445
I understand.
I just can't do this. I'm sorry.

1478
01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.739
Okay. then this is why
we're in this position here. Susan.

1479
01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:46.201
is because the decisions you make
are not reasonable.

1480
01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:48.786
Just like what
we're experiencing right now.

1481
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.039
I just can't do this. I can't do this.

1482
01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:54.292
I've had people sit in this chair
that have done things.

1483
01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.628
and they get up.
they walk out on their own accord.

1484
01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.796
They've done some really bad things.

1485
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.966
Okay? You're not the only person.
but I need you to...

1486
01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.759
I just feel horrible. I can't do this.

1487
01:27:02.842 --> 01:27:05.303
Okay. Well. we're going to go to the jail.

1488
01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:08.306
There's no changing this.
There's no stopping it.

1489
01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:09.849
I don't care. Kill me.

1490
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:15.063
We're not going to kill anybody.
We're going to take you to the jail.

1491
01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:17.774
We'd rather you walk on your own.
we rather you just walk down there.

1492
01:27:17.857 --> 01:27:20.527
It'd be so much better for everybody
if we could just walk down there.

1493
01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:22.528
-Can you just stand up for me?
-No.

1494
01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:24.989
So what. do you plan on
sitting here the rest of the night?

1495
01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:28.033
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Probably going to die of a heart attack.

1496
01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:31.580
Like I said. they have medical staff.
We want to be able to get you over there.

1497
01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:33.122
The quicker we get you over there.

1498
01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:35.833
the quicker someone over there
that's in medical can see you.

1499
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:36.834
I just can't do this.

1500
01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:39.796
Susan. this is what's going to happen.
We're going to put you in handcuffs.

1501
01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:42.674
And if we have
to forcefully bring you out there.

1502
01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.801
that's what we have to do.
because we're obligated

1503
01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:46.803
to take you to the jail now. okay?

1504
01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:48.680
-Thank you for standing up.
-I'm sorry. I just…

1505
01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:49.889
I understand that.

1506
01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:51.683
So put your hands behind your back for me.

1507
01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:00.441
Thank you. Susan.

1508
01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.278
I didn't do this on purpose.
This wasn't a purposeful act.

1509
01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:06.155
I did not premeditate it.
I didn't do anything like that.

1510
01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:07.657
This is ridiculous.

1511
01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:18.001
We're going to go out this way…

1512
01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:23.191
"I am so sorry for your loss.
I never meant to kill your mother."

1513
01:29:23.274 --> 01:29:28.029
"I was terrified
your mom was going to kill me."

1514
01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:30.073
"I shot…

1515
01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:34.452
Out of fear."

1516
01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.304
This is Sheriff Woods.

1517
01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:55.473
And although I haven't spoke
to y'all directly.

1518
01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.266
I have made y'all a promise.

1519
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:58.727
And I'm here to make the phone call

1520
01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:02.814
that we have arrested.
the lady. the shooter.

1521
01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:05.274
She is in custody.

1522
01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:07.485
I am Ajike's mother.

1523
01:30:08.611 --> 01:30:12.740
You may look at her
and say she didn't have much.

1524
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:15.618
She had it all.

1525
01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:21.582
She had love. She had compassion.

1526
01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:28.548
She had four beautiful children.

1527
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.009
Don't grow up feelin' guilty.

1528
01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.679
Don't say Mama wouldn't
have died if it wasn't for me. no.

1529
01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:39.684
Mama chose to stand up for you.
Because Mama knew

1530
01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:44.856
if she allowed people to degrade you
and she'd not stand up for you.

1531
01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:52.113
that you'd grow up with a feeling that
you were something that could be degraded.

1532
01:30:52.196 --> 01:30:55.283
She chose you over her.

1533
01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.870
That's what mothers do.

1534
01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:06.377
I want you to go
and be everything she wanted you to be.

1535
01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:19.932
The night that it happened.

1536
01:31:20.683 --> 01:31:23.311
I fell asleep in my auntie's car.

1537
01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:29.609
And when I was dreaming.
she appeared as an angel.

1538
01:31:55.259 --> 01:31:56.636
Members of the jury.

1539
01:31:56.719 --> 01:32:00.389
you have been selected and sworn
as a jury to try the case

1540
01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:04.227
The State of Florida
versus Susan Louise Lorincz.

1541
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:08.314
Susan Lorincz is charged
with manslaughter by use of a firearm.

1542
01:32:21.744 --> 01:32:25.498
Did you ever see Isaac
and Izzy's mom reach for the door handle?

1543
01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:26.582
No.

1544
01:32:26.666 --> 01:32:31.337
Did you ever hear Isaac and Izzy's mom
say. "I'm going to kill you"?

1545
01:32:31.921 --> 01:32:33.005
No.

1546
01:32:33.089 --> 01:32:36.717
At any time.
did you ever hear

1547
01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:40.680
Isaac and Izzy's mom say.
"I'm going to kill you"?

1548
01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:41.889
No. sir.

1549
01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:45.393
There have been shootings
in that neighborhood before?

1550
01:32:45.476 --> 01:32:47.228
-Objection. Irrelevance.
-Yes.

1551
01:32:47.311 --> 01:32:48.479
Sustained.

1552
01:32:49.146 --> 01:32:51.941
It's like a plastic-looking sign.
it's not really cardboard.

1553
01:32:52.024 --> 01:32:55.069
that you buy at the store
with a metal stake.

1554
01:32:57.071 --> 01:33:01.409
And Miss Owens told you
that she said to Susan on that night.

1555
01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:03.578
"The next time you walk up on my kids.

1556
01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:06.497
"you're going to have
to take it up with me." right?

1557
01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:07.707
Correct.

1558
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:10.459
Have you ever
personally told any of those children

1559
01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:12.169
they weren't allowed to do that?

1560
01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:13.254
I have not.

1561
01:33:13.337 --> 01:33:15.464
And why wouldn't you be able to do that?

1562
01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:17.550
-It's not my property.
-Okay.

1563
01:33:18.342 --> 01:33:21.137
The photograph 12
Is just a close-up of those two skates.

1564
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.220
Yes. it is.

1565
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:34.984
I don't know where she is.

1566
01:33:35.067 --> 01:33:37.320
I'm still in my house.
I didn't open my door to her.

1567
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.240
When I arrived on scene.

1568
01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:43.326
it was complete chaos.

1569
01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:45.953
I saw the victim laying on the ground.

1570
01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:48.623
and several people
were stating that she was shot.

1571
01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:50.959
Did you look
to see if there was any damage

1572
01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.669
to the exterior of the door itself
besides the bullet hole?

1573
01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:55.755
I did not see
anything of significance.

1574
01:33:55.838 --> 01:33:58.591
Did you locate anything
of significance in that trash can

1575
01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:00.301
underneath the marker number three?

1576
01:34:00.384 --> 01:34:02.803
There were two firearms.

1577
01:34:03.512 --> 01:34:05.431
This is the firearm.

1578
01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.562
If the evidence shows
something different

1579
01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:13.648
than what you're saying.
it doesn't look good.

1580
01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.985
Did you force her
or threaten her in any way

1581
01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:19.570
to get her to talk to you
the second time on June 6th?

1582
01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:20.571
No. sir.

1583
01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:22.740
Which is two minutes
after you hung up

1584
01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.242
with the communication center
the first time.

1585
01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:27.703
So that's two minutes
that all these things

1586
01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:30.247
that you say occurred
happened at your front door.

1587
01:34:31.415 --> 01:34:32.416
This case

1588
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.502
basically requires you as a jury

1589
01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:36.212
to answer one question.

1590
01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:39.590
Was it reasonable to shoot through

1591
01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:44.470
a closed. locked. dead-bolted metal door

1592
01:34:44.553 --> 01:34:47.473
at someone who was banging
and yelling on the other side?

1593
01:34:47.973 --> 01:34:49.653
That's the ultimate question in this case.

1594
01:34:50.893 --> 01:34:54.105
If you are anywhere
along this chart

1595
01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:56.065
other than the red part at the bottom.

1596
01:34:56.148 --> 01:34:58.859
you have to find Susan Lorincz not guilty.

1597
01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:04.198
I'm gonna have the clerk
read the verdict.

1598
01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.662
The verdict as in count one.

1599
01:35:09.745 --> 01:35:13.833
We the jury find
as to count one of the charge

1600
01:35:13.916 --> 01:35:16.210
the defendant is guilty of manslaughter.

1601
01:35:16.293 --> 01:35:18.879
Did the state prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that

1602
01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:23.300
during the commission of the offense.
the defendant personally used a firearm?

1603
01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:27.972
Yes. So say we all.
dated the 16th day of August. 2024.

1604
01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:33.728
Miss Lorincz. the jury has found
you guilty of manslaughter with a firearm.

1605
01:35:33.811 --> 01:35:36.897
You're going to be held in custody
at the Marion County jail without bond.

1606
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:39.817
Okay? Thank you and good luck to you.

1607
01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.569
Thank you. Judge.
May we be excused?

1608
01:35:41.652 --> 01:35:43.154
-Yes. ma'am.
-Thank you.

1609
01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:51.370
My baby! Thank you. Jesus!
