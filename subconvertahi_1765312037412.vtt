Power. you drank

didn't you?

37
00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:26.260

Drain her blood?

41
00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.637
Power has to
have her blood drained
every once in a while.

42
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:38.840
or else she becomes
even more scary

-and self-centered
than she normally is.
-[yelps]

44

[Makima] So that's why...
Denji...
Huh?

45
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.147
Is it okay if I borrow Power

Who is this guy?

55
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.445
[Makima] He's
the Shark Fiend.

56
00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:21.414
Normally. he's so ferocious
that no one can even have
a conversation with him.

57
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:23.751
But he said that
as long as he gets
to pair up with you. Denji.

58
00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.319
he'll do whatever
you tell him to.

59
00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.255
He'll do whatever
I tell him to do?

60
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.790
-How come?
-I'm not sure.

61
00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:31.292
Maybe it's because
your faces look alike.

62
00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.027
Lord Chainsaw!
I'll do whatever you say!

63
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.427
No matter what!
Lord Chainsaw!

64
00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:35.997

Don't touch me!
I'm not into men.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.509
Hmm? You look unhappy.

68
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.680
I feel great.

69
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:58.519
If you really are
feeling great.

70
00:06:58.653 --> 00:07:01.421
then how about
going on a date with me
tomorrow on our day off?

71
00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.423
A date?

72
00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:10.932

I couldn't sleep last night.
I got here at 5:00.

81
00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:33.788
So... what's the plan
for today?

82
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:37.124
I've never hung out
with a girl before.

83
00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:43.463
Today. from now until midnight.
we're going to go

That was disappointing.

96
00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:22.203
[Makima] It wasn't
very interesting at all.

97
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:25.139
It looked like
they spent a lot of money
making that movie though.

98
00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:29.010
Well. then...
let's go to the next one.

That was disappointing.

105
00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:51.732
[Makima] I didn't like
how it felt

106
00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.834

to force us to cry.

[tense music playing]

112
00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:11.752
It was just average.

is hard to understand.

117

Do you want to try
watching it. Denji?

118
00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:27.101
[Denji] Honestly.
all the movies
we've seen today are bad.

119
00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:30.704
Maybe I don't get movies
or something.

120
00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:35.409
I only find one good movie
for every ten movies
I watch too.

121

Huh?

122
00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:41.215

128

I'm never going to forget
that last scene
until the day I die.

129
00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:02.129
Me too. That last movie made
the price of the ticket
worth it.

Makima. do you think
I have a heart?

131
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:13.140
Why are you asking
that question?

132
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:15.610

around in public anymore.

177
00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:57.706
Okay!

178
00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:03.143
Why do fiends all
have such weird names?

179
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:12.219
[footsteps approaching]

180
00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:15.356
-[door opens]
-[Denji sighs]

181
00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.092
I should have brought
an umbrella.

182
00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:25.533
[liquid shaking]

183
00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:29.537
[person] Whoa! [giggling]

184
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:32.039
-[door opens]
-[chuckles]

185
00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:34.074
Hello. hello.

186
00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.377
It's raining so hard.

187
00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:39.313
Huh? Uh...

188
00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:41.915
The weather report said...

189
00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:44.686
Hmm?

190
00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.021
Huh? [laughing]

191
00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:50.592
Huh? What's wrong?

192
00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.926
Sorry.

193
00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:55.864
What's wrong with you?

194
00:14:57.064 --> 00:15:00.502
[person crying]

195
00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:03.237
[Denji] Huh?
How come you're crying?

196
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.038
[person] Sorry.

197
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.408
Your face...

198
00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:09.778
looks like my dog
that passed away.

199
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.213
Huh? You're saying
I'm a dog?

200
00:15:13.347 --> 00:15:15.916
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

201
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.289
-[gags]
-Hmm? Are you okay?

202
00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.761
[retches]
Uh...

203
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:31.432
Hold on!
I've got a handkerchief!

204
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.770
Ta-da!

205
00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:37.806
What? [gasps]

206
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:38.972
A magic trick?

207
00:15:39.674 --> 00:15:40.941
That's amazing!

208
00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:44.311
There's no trick to it.

209
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:49.316
Thanks.

210
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.787
[gentle music playing]

211
00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:05.432
Ah. It stopped raining!

212
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:10.103
I work at a café
called Crossroads
right down there.

213
00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:12.439
If you drop by.
I'll pay you back for this.

214
00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:15.008
Make sure you come. okay?

215
00:16:56.784 --> 00:16:58.385
All right.

216
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.523
You're late.
I'm going to deduct it
from your pay.

217
00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:02.657
You're so stingy!

218
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.025
Take this water to table four.

219
00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:07.862
Stingy! Stingy!
Stingy! Stingy! Stingy!

220
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:10.865
[scoffs]

221
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.167
Th... That was fast!

222
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:17.705
Huh? You got here
faster than me!

223
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.874
Well. I guess you're right.

224
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.410
I just came so that
you could pay me back.

225
00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:25.445
Hmm?

226
00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:31.686
Oh.
Let's have a drink together!

227
00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:35.389
Hey! Can you bring some coffee
for me and him?

228
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:37.926
But you work here.

229
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.928
What's the big deal?

230
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.697
We only get customers
in the morning anyway.

231
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.064
[groans]

232
00:17:45.033 --> 00:17:46.300
Well...

233
00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:49.771
[person] A cup of coffee
is my gift back to you!

234
00:17:50.672 --> 00:17:51.773
Do you like coffee?

235
00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:53.575
I'll drink it.

236
00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:02.050
[laughs] What's with that face?
You're just pretending
you're fine!

237
00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.217
Coffee tastes bad!

238
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:06.286
It tastes like
it's from the gutter!

239
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.224
You're just like a little kid!

240
00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:17.264
[Denji]
<i>She's touching me a lot.</i>
<i>and she's laughing at my jokes.</i>

241
00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:18.733
<i>Could it be that...</i>

242
00:18:19.534 --> 00:18:21.101
<i>she likes me?</i>

243
00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:24.639
My name's Reze.

244
00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:25.873
What's your name?

245
00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:27.942
Denji.

246
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:29.844
Denji?

247
00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:32.080
Denji...

248
00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:39.554
Denji. I've never met someone
as interesting as you.

249
00:18:41.055 --> 00:18:43.256
[stammers] Huh...

250
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.693
<i>I'm sure about it now.</i>
<i>She does like me.</i>

251
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.529
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

252
00:18:48.663 --> 00:18:51.833
<i>I like people who like me too.</i>

253
00:18:53.034 --> 00:18:55.135
<i>Makima... help.</i>

254
00:18:56.203 --> 00:18:59.206
<i>I'm going to</i>
<i>start falling for this girl.</i>

255
00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:17.825
You've had three already.
That's enough.

256
00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:19.393
We're going to
go on patrol now.

257
00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:23.665
Eating ice cream
made me tired.

258
00:19:23.798 --> 00:19:26.299
I heard that eating
takes energy too.

259
00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:34.075
I don't want to work
anymore today.

260
00:19:34.207 --> 00:19:36.644
They found out
where the Gun Devil is.

261
00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:38.112
There's going to be
an expedition.

262
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:40.114
In order to participate.

263
00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:43.618
I need to have more experience
defeating big devils.

264
00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:47.088
That's why I want to
go look for more devils.

265
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.525
You're my buddy.
Please help me out.

266
00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:51.993
Huh?

267
00:19:55.129 --> 00:19:56.798
Hmm...

268
00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:00.535
[sighs]

269
00:20:00.668 --> 00:20:03.037
How about I think about it
a bit after I've had
another ice cream?

270
00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:05.940
Get up.

271
00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:08.576
If I tell the leadership
that you're useless.

272
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.511
they're going to kill you
as a devil.

273
00:20:10.645 --> 00:20:11.879
Are you sure
you're okay with that?

274
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.916
Hmm.

275
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.557
I'd rather die than work.

276
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.428
[Makima] <i>He's the second-most</i>
<i>powerful member of Division 4.</i>

277
00:20:28.563 --> 00:20:29.697
<i>after Captain Kishibe.</i>

278
00:20:31.032 --> 00:20:34.401
At least he would be
if he weren't always so lazy.

279
00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:37.705
If you want
to join the expedition
to defeat the Gun Devil.

280
00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:40.608
then you should try
to make good use of him.

281
00:20:41.943 --> 00:20:44.946
I don't think
I can get along well
with a devil.

282
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:48.315
But you get along
with Power. right?

283
00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:51.552
We had a fistfight
just this morning.

284
00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:56.858
You don't have to
become friends.

285
00:20:56.991 --> 00:20:59.861
Just use him
for your own benefit.

286
00:20:59.994 --> 00:21:02.730
He's someone
who killed every single person

287
00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:05.066
in the village
where he was born.

288
00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:06.601
Or to put it more accurately:

289
00:21:06.734 --> 00:21:08.503
He sucked the lifespans
out of them

290
00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:10.437
and transformed them
into weapons.

291
00:21:11.172 --> 00:21:12.106
Weapons?

292
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.875
[Makima] He has the power

293
00:21:14.008 --> 00:21:16.443
to transform
the life of anyone he touches
into a weapon.

294
00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:20.347
That katana you have
is one of his weapons too.

295
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.951
Those weapons can do things
like cut through ghosts
that no one can touch...

296
00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:26.419
and have different
special powers.

297
00:21:28.256 --> 00:21:31.291
It's okay
if you have to pretend.
Just be friendly with him.

298
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:33.961
I'm sure
he'll be useful to you.

299
00:21:37.765 --> 00:21:40.701
[crows cawing]

300
00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:48.910
[Aki panting]

301
00:21:55.249 --> 00:21:57.185
I've eliminated the devil!

302
00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:00.922
Please make sure
not to touch its blood
or its flesh!

303
00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:03.524
[sighs]

304
00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:09.864
Whoa. that looks delicious.

305
00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:13.534
Hey you. human.

306
00:22:13.668 --> 00:22:15.203
Come over here.

307
00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:19.273
He must be
a private Devil Hunter.

308
00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:21.809
He was being eaten up
by this devil.

309
00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:25.146
The lower half of his body
is gone already.
He's almost dead.

310
00:22:25.847 --> 00:22:28.883
[sputtering]

311
00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:33.855
Kill me. Kill me.

312
00:22:33.988 --> 00:22:37.191
[Aki] Your power
gives you the ability
to kill him painlessly.

313
00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:39.093
Grant him his wish to die.

314
00:22:39.227 --> 00:22:40.561
Huh? No way.

315
00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:43.564
I may be an angel.
but I'm also a devil.

316
00:22:43.698 --> 00:22:47.134
I believe that humans
should suffer when they die.

317
00:22:55.743 --> 00:22:58.212
[gasps. sputtering]

318
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:01.682
[sputtering stops]

319
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.789
I don't think
we can become friends.
Even if I pretend.

320
00:23:10.024 --> 00:23:11.058
I guess not.

321
00:23:14.662 --> 00:23:18.366
[Denji] <i>Makima's the one</i>
<i>who found my heart.</i>

322
00:23:18.498 --> 00:23:22.336
<i>So that's why</i>
<i>my heart belongs to Makima.</i>

323
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:26.240
<i>But... my body...</i>

324
00:23:26.374 --> 00:23:27.909
<i>It's moving on its own!</i>

325
00:23:30.044 --> 00:23:32.113
Oh. it's you!

326
00:23:32.246 --> 00:23:33.848
I came to have lunch.

327
00:23:34.882 --> 00:23:36.416
The food here's not that good.

328
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.920
No one would come every day
for a whole week.

329
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.755
It's good.

330
00:23:40.888 --> 00:23:42.390
It is good.

331
00:23:42.523 --> 00:23:44.424
You have such bad taste.

332
00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:47.295
Well...

333
00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:49.931
I'll have some curry
and some ice cream.

334
00:23:50.064 --> 00:23:51.632
Ah! And some fried rice!

335
00:23:51.766 --> 00:23:55.569
How about you come eat
over here at this table?

336
00:23:55.703 --> 00:23:56.837
I'm fine here.

337
00:23:56.971 --> 00:23:58.606
You're studying
right now. right?

338
00:23:58.739 --> 00:23:59.907
Even though
you're on the clock.

339
00:24:00.041 --> 00:24:02.710
You don't go to school. right?

340
00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:04.745
Even though you're 16.

341
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.415
[sighs]

342
00:24:07.548 --> 00:24:11.118
I think that's even worse.

343
00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:13.087
Do you really think so?

344
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.422
I see.

345
00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:16.023
You're working
as a Devil Hunter

346
00:24:16.157 --> 00:24:17.425
instead of going to school.

347
00:24:17.558 --> 00:24:19.894
You're a weird one.

348
00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:27.969
I'm going to study over here.

349
00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:29.870
[stammers]
Scoot over!
Scoot over!

350
00:24:32.974 --> 00:24:34.075
[food sizzling]

351
00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:36.344
I want to learn
how to read kanji.

352
00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.079
[Reze] You can't read kanji?

353
00:24:38.212 --> 00:24:40.348
Then I'll teach you!

354
00:24:41.415 --> 00:24:42.650
Here's a question.

355
00:24:43.184 --> 00:24:44.185
Ta-da!

356
00:24:44.318 --> 00:24:46.153
What does this say?

357
00:24:46.287 --> 00:24:48.689
[Denji] That says "balls."
you sex-crazed girl.

358
00:24:48.823 --> 00:24:51.092
So you do know what it says.

359
00:24:51.225 --> 00:24:54.428
"Balls" is the only one
I can read.

360
00:24:58.332 --> 00:24:59.834
That's crazy.

361
00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:08.442
I wish I could have
gone to school with you.

362
00:25:08.576 --> 00:25:10.144
It would have been fun.

363
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.548
[chuckles]

364
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.718
[Denji] <i>What am I saying?</i>

365
00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:23.657
[gasps]
Do you want to go with me?

366
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:25.626
At night.
At night?

367
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.830
Let's go explore
a school building together
at night.

368
00:25:33.868 --> 00:25:34.902
Okay.

369
00:25:35.936 --> 00:25:38.039
<i>My heart belongs to Makima.</i>

370
00:25:39.106 --> 00:25:42.043
<i>but my body</i>
<i>won't listen to me!</i>

371
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.748
[water running]

372
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.321
[person] Typhoon.

373
00:25:55.022 --> 00:25:55.990
[Typhoon] What is it?

374
00:25:56.123 --> 00:25:58.793
[person] Why do you devils

375
00:25:58.926 --> 00:26:01.262
want Chainsaw's heart?

376
00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:04.899
[Typhoon] You don't
need to know.

377
00:26:05.032 --> 00:26:06.901
The only thing you need
to focus on is holding up
your end of the contract

378
00:26:07.034 --> 00:26:08.202
between you and me.

379
00:26:08.335 --> 00:26:09.770
[person chuckles]
Sounds like

380
00:26:09.904 --> 00:26:12.006
we're going to be
working together for a while.

381
00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:14.375
So let's get more comfortable
with each other.

382
00:26:15.743 --> 00:26:18.312
Typhoon Devil.

383
00:26:21.516 --> 00:26:26.420
The contract is that once
I get my hands on
Chainsaw's heart.

384
00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:29.056
you'll let me
use your powers forever.

385
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:35.262
[Typhoon] Be careful. The human
who has Chainsaw's heart
has killed lots of devils.

386
00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:39.366
That's because
the devils aren't very bright.

387
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:47.274
I killed
a Devil Hunter from China
for a job once.

388
00:26:47.408 --> 00:26:53.314
He was a merciless
Devil Hunter. They said
he had no blood or tears.

389
00:26:53.447 --> 00:26:55.749
[Typhoon]
How did you kill him?
[thud]

390
00:26:56.383 --> 00:26:58.752
[grunting]

391
00:27:02.723 --> 00:27:06.093
I looked for how I could
make him bleed and cry.

392
00:27:06.227 --> 00:27:08.996
I took his wife and kid
as hostages.

393
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.066
Then I skinned them
and showed him their hides.

394
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:14.135
He let me kill him after that.

395
00:27:14.268 --> 00:27:15.469
[blade scrapes]

396
00:27:15.604 --> 00:27:18.372
-[blade stabbing]
-[screaming]

397
00:27:28.983 --> 00:27:30.451
[Reze] Denji.
aren't you scared?

398
00:27:31.485 --> 00:27:35.122
[Denji] Uh.
I'm not really scared.

399
00:27:35.256 --> 00:27:37.191
This just feels weird.

400
00:27:37.324 --> 00:27:39.927
[Reze giggles]
What do you mean?

401
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.202
Hey. I'm a little scared.

402
00:27:49.436 --> 00:27:50.738
Can I hold your hand?

403
00:28:00.515 --> 00:28:02.016
[Denji] <i>Makima.</i>

404
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:04.885
<i>To be honest.</i>
<i>I don't want to hold her hand.</i>

405
00:28:06.655 --> 00:28:09.723
<i>But my body just...</i>

406
00:28:09.857 --> 00:28:11.158
[chuckles]

407
00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:16.631
Who knows the answer?

408
00:28:16.764 --> 00:28:18.199
Me! Me! Me!

409
00:28:18.332 --> 00:28:19.568
Two! It's two!

410
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.235
That's right! You're a genius!

411
00:28:22.537 --> 00:28:26.240
-What does this
English word mean?
-I have no idea!

412
00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:28.809
The answer is: "Big ass."

413
00:28:28.943 --> 00:28:30.311
You sex-crazed girl!

414
00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:34.448
Huh... So this
is what school is like.

415
00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:36.217
I think I've got
the hang of it now.

416
00:28:37.818 --> 00:28:41.121
Denji. is it really true that
you didn't even go
to elementary school?

417
00:28:41.255 --> 00:28:42.723
Huh? Yeah.

418
00:28:43.357 --> 00:28:47.761
Isn't that... bad?

419
00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:49.363
Bad?

420
00:28:50.197 --> 00:28:51.600
Well. not bad.

421
00:28:52.266 --> 00:28:53.467
It's weird.

422
00:28:55.537 --> 00:28:58.707
A 16-year-old is still a kid.

423
00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:01.041
Normally. you'd study
for entrance exams.

424
00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:04.679
join school clubs.
and go out with friends.

425
00:29:04.812 --> 00:29:10.050
But you...
you kill devils and almost
get yourself killed by them.

Is Public Safety.
that place you work at now.

427
00:29:12.587 --> 00:29:14.188
is it really a good place?

428
00:29:15.856 --> 00:29:19.193
Well. it's
a really good place. you know.

429
00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:21.061
I get to eat three meals a day.

430
00:29:21.195 --> 00:29:22.830
And I get to sleep on a futon.

431
00:29:24.633 --> 00:29:28.335
But that's the bare minimum
for everyone in Japan.

432
00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:30.471
It's something that's normal
for everyone.

433
00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:32.940
Uh...

434
00:29:34.408 --> 00:29:37.244
My head's getting hot
from thinking too hard.

435
00:29:39.813 --> 00:29:40.848
[Reze] In that case...

436
00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:44.285
Do you want to cool down a bit?

437
00:29:45.352 --> 00:29:47.388
[calm music playing]

438
00:29:54.763 --> 00:29:57.699
[giggling] It's so cold!

439

[Denji] I don't know
how to swim that well.

440
00:30:14.616 --> 00:30:16.450
Hmm?

441
00:30:17.719 --> 00:30:20.154
Then I'll teach you
how to swim.

442
00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:23.792
[gasps]

443
00:30:24.358 --> 00:30:27.696
Huh? [gasping]

444
00:30:29.363 --> 00:30:30.632
Huh?

445
00:30:30.765 --> 00:30:32.466
Take off your clothes.

446
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.636
Your clothes are going to
pull you down.

447
00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:36.638
[Denji] You're so sexy.

448
00:30:36.771 --> 00:30:39.340
Don't you want to learn
how to swim?

449
00:30:41.108 --> 00:30:42.876
I am starting to want to learn.

451
00:30:47.816 --> 00:30:50.484
Denji. you should
get naked too.

452
00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:54.321
It's dark. I can't see anyway.

[chuckles] I know
what's going on.

464
00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:27.789
You're scared
to get in the pool
because you can't swim.

466

[Reze] I'll teach you.

I'll teach you things
you don't know.

how to do.

494
00:34:07.849 --> 00:34:11.351
The country mouse
or the city mouse.

00:34:11.485 --> 00:34:13.053
Which one would you rather be?

496
00:34:13.988 --> 00:34:15.322
What are you talking about?

497
00:34:16.524 --> 00:34:18.458
It's one of Aesop's fables.

498
00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:24.197
The country mouse
lives a safe life.

499
00:34:24.331 --> 00:34:27.434
but doesn't have delicious food
like the city mouse.

500
00:34:27.569 --> 00:34:30.738
The city mouse
can find good food.

501
00:34:30.872 --> 00:34:33.575
but he's in danger
of getting killed
by a cat or a human.

502
00:34:38.012 --> 00:34:40.515
I wanted to be
the country mouse.

503
00:34:41.649 --> 00:34:43.718
But Makima captured me

504
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:46.521
and brought me to the city.

505
00:34:51.124 --> 00:34:53.828
My heart belongs
in the countryside.

506
00:34:53.962 --> 00:34:57.331
I don't want to follow around
a city mouse like you
and put myself in danger.

507
00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:00.233
Hey...

508
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:03.303
[no audible dialogue]

509
00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:07.041
[Denji] I want to be
the city mouse.

510
00:35:07.174 --> 00:35:08.241
What?

511
00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:10.878
Being the country mouse
is better!

512
00:35:11.012 --> 00:35:13.081
A peaceful life is what's best.

513
00:35:13.213 --> 00:35:15.215
[Denji] The city
has more good food.

514
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:16.483
And it looks fun.

515
00:35:16.618 --> 00:35:18.086
[Reze chuckles]

516
00:35:18.218 --> 00:35:20.688
Are you saying
you just want to eat
and have fun?

517
00:35:20.822 --> 00:35:22.155
Yeah.

518
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.030
In that case.
there's a festival
going on nearby tomorrow.

519
00:35:29.162 --> 00:35:32.667
Do you want to go together?
I'm sure it'll be fun.
And delicious.

520
00:35:34.936 --> 00:35:37.237
I can go if it's after work.

521
00:35:37.371 --> 00:35:40.842
Yay! It's a promise. okay?

522
00:35:43.377 --> 00:35:45.947
I'm going to the restroom.

559

who you are?

560
00:39:15.323 --> 00:39:17.558
I know who you are.

561
00:39:17.692 --> 00:39:20.161
You're a piece of cheese.

562
00:39:20.294 --> 00:39:23.798

What are you talking about?
Please stop!

564

what I'm going to tell him.

"Your precious woman
is still alive."

568

everyone starts
listening to me
for some reason.

570

Then all that's left
for me to do is to kill him.

He said it's the best spot
to watch fireworks.

It's a secret spot.

these days.

I think your current situation
is weird.

You're only 16.
but they're not
letting you go to school.

615

And they're
making you kill devils.

616

this country should allow.

I'll ask my friend.

My friend has a place
where Public Safety
will never find you.

It won't happen right away.

626

but we can go to school
together there someday.

627

Why would you do all that
for me?

628

00:53:07.855 --> 00:53:09.356
Thank you very much.

706
00:53:12.527 --> 00:53:16.698
Hey. You haven't told him
that you'll be dead
in five years?

707
00:53:17.832 --> 00:53:20.300
[Aki] Who did
you hear that from?

708
00:53:20.434 --> 00:53:21.869
From Power.

709
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:23.971
That damn devil.

710
00:53:25.439 --> 00:53:27.008
Don't tell anyone.

711
00:53:28.676 --> 00:53:30.410
You're so lucky.

712
00:53:30.545 --> 00:53:32.680
I want to die soon too.

713
00:53:33.848 --> 00:53:36.450
As long as I'm alive.
I have to work hard.

714
00:53:36.584 --> 00:53:38.720
If I die. I won't have to
work hard anymore.

715
00:53:40.188 --> 00:53:42.123
Oh. that reminds me...

716
00:53:42.255 --> 00:53:45.026
You have a contract
with the Future Devil. right?

717
00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:46.828
Why don't you try asking it?

718
00:53:46.961 --> 00:53:48.696
Ask it when I'm going to die.

719
00:53:49.897 --> 00:53:51.165
I refuse.

720
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.435
Aki! Come downstairs! Now!

721
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:57.205
[panting]

722
00:53:57.337 --> 00:53:58.706
[Nomo] He showed up
at the entrance

723
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.240
and claimed
he's from the Special Division.

724
00:54:01.209 --> 00:54:03.811
Is this fiend
really on our side?

725
00:54:03.945 --> 00:54:05.747
[Aki] Y-Yes.

726
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.150
Did a devil do this to Denji?

727
00:54:10.218 --> 00:54:13.554
Bomb is coming... Bomb...

728
00:54:13.688 --> 00:54:16.224
She's one of
the Gun Devil's allies!

729
00:54:16.356 --> 00:54:18.226
[whimpering]

730
00:54:18.358 --> 00:54:20.595
How do you know that?

731
00:54:20.728 --> 00:54:22.930
[gasps. stammers]

732
00:54:23.064 --> 00:54:24.364
[Aki] Answer me.

733
00:54:24.498 --> 00:54:27.400
I could kill you right here
if I wanted to.

734
00:54:28.503 --> 00:54:30.470
If I tell you.
they'll kill me.

735
00:54:30.605 --> 00:54:32.372
I promised Makima.

736
00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:33.841
Makima?

737
00:54:33.975 --> 00:54:35.475
[gasps] Ah!

738
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.678
There she is! Bomb's here!

739
00:54:45.452 --> 00:54:46.788
[Nomo] Hey. beautiful lady!

740
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:49.824
Don't come any closer!

741
00:54:49.957 --> 00:54:51.391
This place is
a training facility

742
00:54:51.526 --> 00:54:52.894
for Devil Extermination
Division 2.

743
00:54:53.027 --> 00:54:55.563
Members of the public
are not allowed to enter.

744
00:54:57.297 --> 00:54:59.100
Excuse me!

745
00:54:59.233 --> 00:55:00.300
[Denji grunts]

746
00:55:01.235 --> 00:55:02.236
Reze...

747
00:55:02.369 --> 00:55:03.604
Reze?

748
00:55:03.738 --> 00:55:06.140
Please help me!

749
00:55:06.274 --> 00:55:08.843
I'm being attacked by a devil!

750
00:55:08.976 --> 00:55:10.477
Oh.

751
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:13.181
She's sure smiling a lot
for someone under attack.

752
00:55:13.313 --> 00:55:15.149
Nomo.
Yeah.

753
00:55:15.283 --> 00:55:17.350
Take your friend with you
and stay in the back.

754
00:55:17.484 --> 00:55:18.719
Okay.

755
00:55:18.853 --> 00:55:20.788
Contact headquarters
and the vice-captain.

756
00:55:20.922 --> 00:55:22.523
Summon all Division 2 members.

757
00:55:22.657 --> 00:55:24.091
Okay!

758
00:55:24.225 --> 00:55:25.492
And...

759
00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:28.629
Have you seen that beauty
somewhere before?

760
00:55:28.763 --> 00:55:31.632
Now's not the right time
to try to pick up women.

761
00:55:31.766 --> 00:55:34.202
No. I'm being serious.

762
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.508
It can't be true.
There's no way.

763
00:55:40.641 --> 00:55:43.244
Thanks.
I'm counting on you.

764
00:55:43.376 --> 00:55:44.712
You owe me one.

765
00:55:46.614 --> 00:55:48.149
Kato! Tanabe!

766
00:55:48.282 --> 00:55:51.619
I'll treat you to dinner
if you can kill that woman.

767
00:55:51.752 --> 00:55:54.655
Don't assume she's a human.
Handle her like you would
a devil.

768
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:57.992
[Reze] I guess it didn't work.

769
00:55:58.125 --> 00:55:59.627
It's not working.

770
00:56:00.928 --> 00:56:02.630
In that case.
I've got no choice.

771
00:56:04.699 --> 00:56:07.001
I'll just
have to kill everyone.

772
00:56:13.307 --> 00:56:14.407
Blood?

773
00:56:14.542 --> 00:56:15.676
[Kato] We've caused mold
to grow

774
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:17.511
in her heart and intestines.

775
00:56:17.645 --> 00:56:20.181
[Nomo]
She's throwing up blood.
It's working.

776
00:56:20.314 --> 00:56:21.816
Even if she drinks blood
and regenerates.

777
00:56:21.949 --> 00:56:23.251
the mold's
not going to disappear.

778
00:56:24.151 --> 00:56:26.254
Now we just need
to buy some time.

779
00:56:29.323 --> 00:56:30.524
Hmm?

780
00:56:32.026 --> 00:56:33.426
[all gasp]

781
00:56:33.561 --> 00:56:35.062
[Kato] She inflicted damage
to herself!

782
00:56:37.865 --> 00:56:39.533
Are you able to grow mold
on her brain?

783
00:56:39.667 --> 00:56:41.802
We can only do it
if the target's alive.

784
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:45.606
[gasps]

785
00:56:48.576 --> 00:56:51.312
[Devil Hunters gasping.
exclaiming]

786
00:56:51.444 --> 00:56:52.445
Boo.

787
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.016
[screaming]

788
00:56:55.149 --> 00:56:56.751
[grunts]

789
00:56:56.884 --> 00:56:58.085
[Devil Hunter 1 screaming]

790
00:57:00.388 --> 00:57:02.757
[Devil Hunter 2]
She's a devil!
A devil is here!

791
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.593
She went right!
Don't let her get near Aki!

792
00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:07.395
Nomo! Behind you!

793
00:57:09.864 --> 00:57:11.132
Kon!

794
00:57:15.569 --> 00:57:17.071
Ah--

795
00:57:28.716 --> 00:57:31.484
There she is!
There's the devil!

796
00:57:33.287 --> 00:57:34.789
[gasps]

797
00:57:34.922 --> 00:57:37.425
Masaki Ando.
requesting permission to fire!

798
00:57:37.591 --> 00:57:38.893
[superior] Permission granted!

799
00:57:44.464 --> 00:57:46.499
[alarm blaring]

800
00:57:50.304 --> 00:57:52.606
In Japan.
do you need permission
to fire a gun?

801
00:57:53.908 --> 00:57:54.942
[Nomo] Kon!

802
00:58:00.915 --> 00:58:02.950
[Reze] You're pretty stubborn.

803
00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:06.854
Now that's a real sight
for sore eyes.

804
00:58:09.423 --> 00:58:11.859
[gasping]

805
00:58:12.426 --> 00:58:13.661
[person] Kon.

806
00:58:15.162 --> 00:58:17.999
[grunts. whimpers]

807
00:58:20.534 --> 00:58:22.403
Excuse me for a moment.

808
00:58:22.536 --> 00:58:24.171
Vice-captain!

809
00:58:24.305 --> 00:58:27.341
That was close.

810
00:58:28.509 --> 00:58:31.045
-[gasps]
-[Fox Devil] What's that taste?

811
00:58:31.178 --> 00:58:34.382
-Huh?
-[Fox Devil] I hate this taste.

812
00:58:34.515 --> 00:58:35.683
I'm going home now.

813
00:58:38.819 --> 00:58:40.187
[sighs]

814
00:58:40.321 --> 00:58:43.157
I was supposed to go
to a singles mixer today.

815
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.060
Take me with you
next time.

816
00:58:47.962 --> 00:58:51.265
I'll drive. You have them
drink some of your blood.

817
00:58:51.399 --> 00:58:52.867
Huh?

818
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.602
I guess I've got no choice.

819
00:58:58.172 --> 00:59:00.641
Aren't you
going to start the car?

820
00:59:01.442 --> 00:59:02.810
Damn.

821
00:59:02.943 --> 00:59:06.313
It showed me a future
I didn't want to see.

822
00:59:06.447 --> 00:59:07.381
Huh?

823
00:59:07.516 --> 00:59:08.649
[thud]

824
00:59:18.692 --> 00:59:20.294
That monster.

825
00:59:20.428 --> 00:59:24.065
I killed them to show you
how powerful I am.

826
00:59:24.198 --> 00:59:26.535
I don't want to kill anyone
if possible.

827
00:59:27.835 --> 00:59:30.771
Take Denji out of the car
and leave.

828
00:59:30.905 --> 00:59:32.206
[grunts]

829
00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.278
[honking]

830
00:59:40.247 --> 00:59:41.682
[sighs]

831
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.657
The gasoline is going to
make that car burn to a crisp.

832
00:59:53.794 --> 00:59:56.230
What a pain.

833
00:59:57.731 --> 00:59:59.266
Acho!

834
01:00:03.838 --> 01:00:05.773
I asked the Special Division
for backup.

835
01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.141
They saved us.

836
01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:11.479
[shouts]

837
01:00:13.714 --> 01:00:15.116
No way!

838
01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.620
I kicked with everything I got
just now.

839
01:00:20.555 --> 01:00:22.156
[Reze] Nice kick.

840
01:00:25.726 --> 01:00:26.994
Want to fight?

841
01:00:28.496 --> 01:00:31.566
Kobeni! We're
changing strategies!

842
01:00:31.699 --> 01:00:32.900
[gasps]

843
01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:36.003
This one's
a lot stronger than us!

844
01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:38.405
Time for a strategic retreat!

845
01:00:38.973 --> 01:00:40.441
Anyways. bye.

846
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.012

01:00:48.315 --> 01:00:50.117
My legs gave out...

849
01:00:51.285 --> 01:00:54.121
My legs... My legs...

850

[shrieks]

851
01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.029
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

852
01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:04.965
I'll quit my job.
So please forgive me!

853
01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:08.135
[whimpering]

854
01:01:25.486 --> 01:01:26.521
There she is!

855
01:01:30.824 --> 01:01:32.259

[static]

857
01:01:34.195 --> 01:01:37.831
Hey. Chainsaw's awake now.

858
01:01:37.965 --> 01:01:40.467
But the bomb girl's
right behind us.

859
01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:43.971
Shit! Damn!
[music faintly playing
over static]

860
01:01:44.104 --> 01:01:46.974
The transmitter's broken
on this car. [grunts]

861

[heavy metal music playing]

862
01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:50.110
What's wrong with this car?

863
01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:52.446
If it comes down to it.

864
01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:53.948
I'm going to crash this car
into her!

865
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.784
I can't let her have Denji!

866
01:01:58.587 --> 01:02:00.287
-[gasps]
-[Aki] What's going on?

867
01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:02.356
[Angel] He's cutting
the top of the car!

868
01:02:02.489 --> 01:02:03.625
[Aki] Huh?

869
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:07.828
Stop. Denji!

870
01:02:07.962 --> 01:02:10.431
You haven't had
that much blood yet!

871
01:02:10.565 --> 01:02:14.168
[Denji] It hurt so much.
I thought I was going to die.

872
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:17.238
My brain's all mixed-up.

873
01:02:17.371 --> 01:02:19.940
But I spent some time
looking back on
what's happened.

874
01:02:21.242 --> 01:02:24.111
And I just realized

875
01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:27.716
that every single girl
I ever meet
always tries to kill me!

876
01:02:27.848 --> 01:02:32.052
Everyone always wants
Chainsaw's heart!

877
01:02:32.186 --> 01:02:36.223
Doesn't anyone
want Denji's heart? Huh?

878
01:02:36.357 --> 01:02:39.960
I really do like you.
Denji. It's true.

879
01:02:40.094 --> 01:02:41.962
Huh? Really?

880
01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:44.465
-[horn honks]
-[gasps]

881
01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:47.968
Don't listen to the enemy!
You're so gullible!

882
01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:50.471
[Denji sighs]

883
01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:53.742
That was close.
I was about to get tricked.

884
01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:57.512
I don't know why
you're trying to kill me.

885
01:02:57.646 --> 01:02:59.813
But I don't care!

886
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:02.483
I've got Makima!

887
01:03:02.617 --> 01:03:04.753
Makima?

888
01:03:04.885 --> 01:03:09.390
Denji. I didn't know
that witch has got you
in the palm of her hand.

889
01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:12.493
Then it would have been no use
even if we ran away together.

890
01:03:12.627 --> 01:03:14.161
[chuckles] Aw.

891
01:03:14.295 --> 01:03:17.599
I wish I never kissed you! Aw.

892
01:03:20.769 --> 01:03:22.537
If anyone else dies
because of me.

893
01:03:22.671 --> 01:03:25.039
I'm going to have trouble
getting out of bed
in the morning.

894
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.777
I'm going to arrest you!

895
01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:30.779
Come here. Denji.

896
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:34.516
I'm going to show you
how we fight.

897
01:03:34.649 --> 01:03:37.318
Then show me!

898
01:03:38.452 --> 01:03:40.454
[music continues]

899
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.430
[grunts. groans]

900
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.210
[Reze] Denji.
You're not applying
what you've learned.

901
01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:06.046
You can't just swing
your chainsaws around.

902
01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.849
You've got to understand
your own power better.

903
01:04:08.982 --> 01:04:10.050
Huh?

904
01:04:13.655 --> 01:04:14.723
Boom.

905
01:04:28.001 --> 01:04:29.838
[chainsaws whirring]

906
01:04:55.963 --> 01:04:56.964
[pedestrians scream]

907
01:05:06.039 --> 01:05:07.642
[pedestrian whimpers]

908
01:05:08.676 --> 01:05:09.977
[Reze] Regeneration?

909
01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:12.547
So you were revving the engine

910
01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.915
-before you got kicked.
-[chainsaw whirs]

911
01:05:49.216 --> 01:05:50.585
You Devil!

912
01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:12.874
[Aki] <i>If I mess up even</i>
<i>a single move.</i>
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

913
01:06:13.006 --> 01:06:17.010
<i>I can see the future.</i>
<i>but only a few seconds</i>
<i>in advance.</i>

914
01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:20.080
<i>I don't know if my body</i>
<i>will be able to react in time.</i>

915
01:06:22.149 --> 01:06:24.451
[pedestrians screaming]

916
01:06:25.986 --> 01:06:27.655
<i>Perfect judgment.</i>

917
01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:34.161
<i>Perfect judgment.</i>

918
01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:37.998
<i>Perfect judgment.</i>

919
01:06:43.771 --> 01:06:45.205
<i>Perfect--</i>

920
01:06:52.647 --> 01:06:53.815
[Galgali] That was close!

921
01:06:53.948 --> 01:06:56.818
-[Aki gasps]
-Sorry I'm late.

922
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:59.988
This is the first time
I've ever wanted
to be friends with a Devil!

923
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.388
[Galgali] Here you go.

924
01:07:04.859 --> 01:07:06.995
Time-out!

925
01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:09.831
I'm anemic and I'm
almost naked over here.

926
01:07:09.964 --> 01:07:12.065
And you've got the two of you.
That's not fair.

927
01:07:12.199 --> 01:07:15.570
You're right.
Should we give her a break?

928
01:07:15.703 --> 01:07:16.971
No.

929
01:07:17.104 --> 01:07:19.072
That's what he said. Sorry!

930
01:07:19.206 --> 01:07:20.374
The time-out is over.

931
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:25.212
[gasps]

932
01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:30.818
Lady Reze! Typhoon is here!

933
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.888
That's not fair!

934
01:07:45.432 --> 01:07:47.401
[whimpers. strains]

935
01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:53.975
[Angel] It's okay.

936
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.744
You're going to go to heaven.

937
01:07:58.178 --> 01:07:59.212
[kisses]

938
01:08:01.983 --> 01:08:03.718
I'm going to take your blood.

939
01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:05.053
Sorry.

940
01:08:18.365 --> 01:08:21.069
[Beam stammering]

941
01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:23.638
[chainsaw whirs]

942
01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:25.472
[gasps]

943
01:08:25.607 --> 01:08:28.977
A normal devil
would have been dead.

944
01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:32.947
You're so impressive.
Lord Chainsaw!
You're amazing!

945
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:35.984
[Angel] Your girlfriend has
killed too many people.

946
01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:39.453
If we let her run free.
then many more will die.

947
01:08:40.387 --> 01:08:42.991
Chainsaw. Make your choice.

948
01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:46.995
<i>Either let her kill you</i>
<i>and minimize the damage.</i>

949
01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:48.930
<i>or kill her instead.</i>

950
01:08:50.999 --> 01:08:54.301
[Denji] Well.
that's an easy decision.

951
01:08:55.402 --> 01:08:57.872
Reze is
incredibly powerful. though.

952
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:03.811
[Angel] Shark. you know about
the Chainsaw Devil. right?

953
01:09:03.945 --> 01:09:07.481
If you don't want to die today.
then you should tell us
what you know.

954
01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:12.587
Lord Chainsaw runs
really fast!

955
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.424
But when he goes places.
he doesn't just use his legs.

956
01:09:17.558 --> 01:09:20.160
He uses the chains
on his chainsaws
to get around.

957
01:09:20.293 --> 01:09:21.996
He flings his chains
through the air
and hooks them on buildings.

958
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.032
and then he swings
from building to building!

959
01:09:24.164 --> 01:09:28.335
I see! Samurai Sword
draws his sword to get around.

960
01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:31.105
And Reze uses explosions.

961
01:09:31.238 --> 01:09:33.473
I need to apply
my own powers too!

962
01:09:33.608 --> 01:09:36.744
Lord Chainsaw. you're a genius!
Lord Chainsaw. you're a genius!

963
01:09:36.878 --> 01:09:41.582
I should use chains
to get around!
I see! I get it!

964
01:09:43.283 --> 01:09:46.020
That's right! That's right!

965
01:09:46.154 --> 01:09:47.889
I'm going to try it!

966
01:09:48.022 --> 01:09:50.892
-Beam! Turn into a shark!
-Okay!

967
01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:54.361
Huh?

968
01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:57.899
This is it!

969
01:09:59.167 --> 01:10:01.536
I'm going to use chains
to control Beam.

970
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:04.539
and Beam is going to run
like a horse!

971
01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.710
[straining] That's not it...
That's not it...

972
01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:11.311
Are you sure?
I don't think that's it.

973
01:10:11.445 --> 01:10:14.247
I think you're supposed
to shoot out
the chains from your arms

974
01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:15.917
and hook them onto buildings.

975
01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:19.687
Huh? This is the right way!
Right. Beam?

976
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:21.923
You're right! You're right!
You're right!

977
01:10:22.056 --> 01:10:24.357
All right! Run. Beam!

978
01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:27.360
You're right!

979
01:10:27.494 --> 01:10:29.030
You're right! You're right!

980
01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:35.603
[Denji cackling]

981
01:10:36.637 --> 01:10:39.406
[Reze giggling]
What are you doing?

982
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.976
[Aki] Denji!

983
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.545
There you are. Chainsaw!

984
01:10:44.679 --> 01:10:48.248
Denji! I'm going to make you
regret coming back to life!

985
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:53.721
Beam! Don't make me
regret this!

986
01:10:53.855 --> 01:10:55.089
[Beam] Okay!

987
01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:59.127
Damn! Those guys...

988
01:10:59.292 --> 01:11:01.129
[Galgali] It's
a monster battle!

989
01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:04.098
We're just going to
have to sit it out and watch.

990
01:11:05.566 --> 01:11:06.667
[grunts]

991
01:11:07.568 --> 01:11:08.603
[grunts]

992
01:11:17.044 --> 01:11:19.981
You keep missing!

993
01:11:20.114 --> 01:11:21.783
You're like a cockroach.

994
01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:24.986
-[Denji cackles]
-[Beam] I'm tired
of the explosions!

995
01:11:25.119 --> 01:11:27.387
Chainsaw!

996
01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.999
-[gasps]
-[chainsaw whirring]

997
01:11:38.132 --> 01:11:40.168
-Take that!
-Ouch!

998
01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:44.437
[Denji] What a waste.

999
01:11:44.572 --> 01:11:47.108
I cut off
a beautiful woman's leg.

1000
01:11:47.241 --> 01:11:50.477
Lady Reze! Take my blood!

1001
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:57.819
[Denji] Oh! Good!

1002
01:11:57.952 --> 01:11:59.687
Wait. that's not good!

1003
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:02.890
[chuckling] This is crazy.

1004
01:12:04.592 --> 01:12:05.626
Oh!

1005
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.834
[straining]

1006
01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:15.036
Grab on to something!

1007
01:12:15.803 --> 01:12:18.172
I can't! I can't!

1008
01:12:27.347 --> 01:12:28.381
It's okay.

1009
01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:32.820
It's okay! You can let go!

1010
01:12:32.954 --> 01:12:34.822
If I'm going to die.
I don't care!

1011
01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:36.891
It just means today
was my day to die.

1012
01:12:37.457 --> 01:12:39.492
I'll be fine.

1013
01:12:39.627 --> 01:12:42.063
I've been ready to die
for a long time.

1014
01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:44.665
[straining]

1015
01:12:56.344 --> 01:13:00.047

[Aki panting]

1017
01:13:09.357 --> 01:13:11.359
[Angel] Why?

1018
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:13.327
Why did you touch my hand?

1019
01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.230
-Do you want to die?
-Of course I don't want to die!

1020
01:13:20.735 --> 01:13:23.704
How much did my lifespan
decrease just now?

1021
01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:28.408
About two months.

1022
01:13:35.683 --> 01:13:37.218
If you want to die.

1023
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:38.886
then die somewhere
far away from me.

1024
01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.023
I can't take it anymore.
watching someone die

1025
01:13:42.723 --> 01:13:44.392
right in front of me.

1026
01:14:05.413 --> 01:14:08.416
[Beam] Lord Chainsaw!
We're in trouble!
Something's coming!

1027
01:14:08.549 --> 01:14:10.483
Lord Chainsaw-- [screams]

1028
01:14:15.256 --> 01:14:17.124
[Reze] Hmm? Huh?

1029
01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:20.161
[Denji cackling]

1035
01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:47.748
[Denji] Whoa. [grunts]

1036
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:57.925
[Reze] You were
hanging in there
for a pretty long time.

1037
01:15:59.593 --> 01:16:00.795
But I think it's time now...

1038
01:16:03.397 --> 01:16:04.932
to put an end to this.

1039
01:16:12.173 --> 01:16:13.207

1040
01:16:14.608 --> 01:16:15.576
[gasps]

1041
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:18.212
[Denji] That was close!

1042
01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:20.414
Beam!

1043
01:16:20.549 --> 01:16:21.849
Lord Chainsaw!

1044
01:16:21.982 --> 01:16:24.018
I'll make sure
you won't regret this!

1045
01:16:34.529 --> 01:16:36.363
[Denji] Hey! This is bad!

1046
01:16:36.497 --> 01:16:38.632
He's going to
turn the whole city
into mincemeat at this rate!

1047
01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:42.470
Beam! We've got to get
that fat-ass to shut up first!

1048
01:16:42.603 --> 01:16:43.737
Okay!

1049
01:16:54.982 --> 01:16:57.017
[Typhoon] I found you!

1050

[chainsaws whir]

1051
01:17:02.923 --> 01:17:06.528

This makes it easy for me!

1061
01:17:52.339 --> 01:17:55.644
All I have to do
is swing my chainsaws around...

1062

Where's Reze?

1075
01:19:17.626 --> 01:19:19.326

it's about time you gave up?

Uh...

1092
01:21:18.646 --> 01:21:19.681

1096
01:21:40.234 --> 01:21:44.672
You're being a huge
pain in the ass.
Just hurry up and die already.

1097
01:21:44.806 --> 01:21:50.077
Then you should have just
killed me when we first met!

1098
01:21:52.179 --> 01:21:53.615
There's nowhere left to run.

1099
01:21:53.748 --> 01:21:55.617
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

1100
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:59.854
You shouldn't have taught me
how to swim.

1101
01:21:59.987 --> 01:22:02.690
[Reze] Huh...
You're going to swim?

1102

1103
01:22:31.985 --> 01:22:33.454

[gasps]

1105
01:22:52.774 --> 01:22:56.945
Can you still explode
when you're wet?

1106
01:24:30.605 --> 01:24:32.640
[snoring]

1107
01:24:44.919 --> 01:24:46.420
[Reze] I can't believe it.

1108
01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:49.891
Why did you resurrect me?

1109
01:24:52.225 --> 01:24:55.530
I have a great life.

1110
01:24:55.663 --> 01:24:59.601
No matter how many times
I get beat up or die.

1111
01:24:59.734 --> 01:25:03.370
as long as
I get to eat good food
the next day. I can forgive.

1112
01:25:04.706 --> 01:25:05.707
But...

1113
01:25:07.174 --> 01:25:10.578
if I capture you
and hand you over
to Public Safety.

1114
01:25:10.712 --> 01:25:14.649
I'd feel like
I had a fish bone
stuck in my throat.

1115
01:25:18.786 --> 01:25:21.355
Even if I were living
a good life every day.

1116
01:25:21.488 --> 01:25:24.826
it would feel bad.
having something
poking the back of my throat.

1117
01:25:30.230 --> 01:25:33.668
[Reze] Do you think
you would still say that
if I killed you right now?

1118
01:25:33.801 --> 01:25:35.536
[chuckles]

1119
01:25:35.670 --> 01:25:37.538
If someone's going to kill me.

1120
01:25:37.672 --> 01:25:39.272
then I'd rather be killed
by a beautiful woman.

1121
01:25:41.576 --> 01:25:43.611
[laughing]

1122
01:25:50.317 --> 01:25:51.586
Ah...

1123
01:25:53.121 --> 01:25:58.693
Do you really still believe
that I like you for real?

1124
01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:02.597
The look on my face
when I met you.
and the way I blushed...

1125
01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:04.498
It was all a lie.

1126
01:26:04.632 --> 01:26:06.601
I just trained myself
how to do it.

1127
01:26:06.734 --> 01:26:07.969
[gasps]

1128
01:26:08.102 --> 01:26:10.605
I failed.

1129
01:26:10.738 --> 01:26:13.508
I took too much time
before I fought you.

1130
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:17.477
I'm going to run away now.

1131
01:26:24.184 --> 01:26:25.820
[Denji] Do you want
to run away together?

1132
01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.990
Huh?

1133
01:26:29.123 --> 01:26:32.192
I can fight too.
You'll have
a better chance at escaping.

1134
01:26:34.227 --> 01:26:36.898
I killed lots of people.

1135
01:26:37.031 --> 01:26:42.269
If you let me get away.
that would make you
complicit in murder.

1136
01:26:42.402 --> 01:26:44.005
Do you understand
what that means?

1137
01:26:45.173 --> 01:26:46.641
Uh...

1138
01:26:46.774 --> 01:26:49.476
I know I shouldn't.
but I've got no choice.

1139
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:51.179
I still like you.

1140
01:26:52.279 --> 01:26:54.048
You said it was all a lie.

1141
01:26:54.182 --> 01:26:57.217
But you did teach me
how to swim. Right?

1144
01:27:40.695 --> 01:27:43.497
[Reze] You should learn
to be smarter.

1145
01:27:43.631 --> 01:27:46.266
Reze! Hey. Reze!

01:27:50.171 --> 01:27:51.773
[sighs]

1147
01:27:51.906 --> 01:27:56.276
I'm going to be waiting
at the café at lunch!

1148
01:27:56.409 --> 01:27:58.079
You'd better--

1149

[coughs]

1150
01:28:01.682 --> 01:28:05.119
Get up. Beam!
My hand won't move!

1151
01:28:06.254 --> 01:28:08.055

[Kishibe] <i>There's</i>

1157
01:28:58.172 --> 01:29:01.309

And the secret room is filled

1160
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.186
The kids who live there
don't have any freedom.

1161
01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.888
They're not allowed
to go outside.

1162
01:29:14.856 --> 01:29:16.691
They're treated like objects.

1163

And the military
uses their bodies
for experiments until they die.

1164
01:29:19.994 --> 01:29:22.897
It was supposed to be
just a fairy tale.

1165
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:25.166
But one day.
a newspaper reported that

1166
01:29:25.299 --> 01:29:28.002
that secret room
really did exist.

1167

One of my friends has a field
in the countryside.

I go there
to help out my friend
every year in the fall.

1187
01:31:45.639 --> 01:31:51.245
The field has mice
hiding in the soil
that damage the crops.

1188
01:31:51.379 --> 01:31:56.484
We have to exterminate the mice
before the fields
get covered in snow.

1189
01:31:56.617 --> 01:32:02.123
So we dig up the fields
and have the dogs
kill the mice hiding inside.

1190
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:04.525
I wonder why...

1191
01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:06.961
whenever I watch...

1192
01:32:08.329 --> 01:32:09.864

I told you
to come with Hayakawa.

1199
01:33:24.738 --> 01:33:28.375
You didn't want to make
Hayakawa kill a girl.

1200
01:33:29.276 --> 01:33:30.478
You're so kind.

1201
01:33:31.479 --> 01:33:33.914
It's because I'm an angel.
