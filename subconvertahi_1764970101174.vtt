Wow.

25
00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.216
We're actually doing this.
How do you feel?

26
00:02:56.176 --> 00:03:00.388
Fine. But. Dad. isn't it better
to franchise one of these?

27
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.806
You're starting at a new school.

28
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.434
You sure you don't need
a new uniform for this school?

29
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.606
Mm. It's only for one semester. you know.

30
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.191
I'll just make a deal with my teacher.

31
00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.318
Hey. your teacher deserves
your respect. okay?

32
00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.154
Uh. wait. here. just in case.

33
00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.280
How much do you need?

34
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.282
Don't worry. look.
I'm already running late. Goodbye!

35
00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.370
Good luck. hun!

36
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:26.998
Thanks!

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.044
You be careful. all right?

38
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:33.421
Love you. hun.

39
00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:35.632
Yeah.

40
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.893
I'll increase
the weights later tonight.

41
00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.853
I want you to wear two each today.

42
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.355
It's fine. Mom. I'll be careful.

43
00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.440
I don't think so. Put them on. Two each.

44
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:53.775
Strap them tight.

45
00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.402
Mom. that's exactly
why I keep losing weight.

46
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.695
They tire me out.

47
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.575
All right. then.
You just be very careful. Okay?

48
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:08.623
Here.

49
00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:12.252
Stand. There we go.

50
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.087
Why is it so heavy?

51
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.214
I put more in the backpack. just in case.

52
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:17.799
Here.

53
00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.550
It's okay. I don't have a break today.

54
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.719
Yeah. take it. anyway. just in case. Here.

55
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.181
When you get to the classroom.
hang your bags on either side of the desk.

56
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.934
stay seated as much as possible.
don't let your guard down.

57
00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:30.687
And also. don't fall asleep at all.
Got that?

58
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.564
Why don't you put on two today? Huh?

59
00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.983
-Just for today.
-I'm already late!

60
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.734
-Ah. Bongseok... Hey. Bongseok. wait!
-I'm leaving. Mom! Bye!

61
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.862
Take the weights!
Don't run or you'll trip and fall!

62
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.907
If they bust you for being late.
just say your mom's really sick!

63
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.826
No. no. just say you got hit by a car!

64
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.787
Honey! Good luck!

-Okay.

73
00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.021
go add more money and get on the next bus.

74
00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.147
It's in 12 minutes.

75
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.982
Then I'll be late for school.

76
00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.650
You're already late. though.

77
00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.278
The other students
all hopped on the last one.

78
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.488
Grab the next one.

79
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.407
-Hello. sir.
-Every single day. you say the same thing.

80
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.743
Uh. I'll pay for her. too.

81
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.581
Ooh. quite the gentleman.

82
00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:15.666
<i>Transfer valid.</i>

83
00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.503
Dude. thanks. I'll pay you back.

84
00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.214
I owe you 720. then. right?

85
00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.967
Oh. no. I transferred from another bus.
so it's already covered.

86
00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.553
All right. then.

87
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.484
Why are you...

88
00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:43.528
speaking so casually?

89
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.447
We just met. you know.

90
00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.493
Aren't you in high school?
I'm a senior there.

91
00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.454
All the students talk in a casual way.

92
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.249
It's cool. It's okay.

93
00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.335
I. uh. but it's not good manners.

94
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.296
to be so familiar
when we don't know each other.

95
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.881
Why are you so old-fashioned?

96
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:06.050
Set your bag down.

97
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.680
Oh!

98
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.807

109
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.063
I really should get her
a new uniform for her school.

112
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.467
Oh. god. I hope
there were no incidents today.

113
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.096
Excuse me. are you open?

114
00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.138

Hey. you. Sorry. Bongseok.
You're too late!

120
00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:45.126
A late student on the first day of school.
and from my class. no less.

121
00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.837
I had to run the whole way.

122
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.172
Oh. and I had to eat breakfast. too.
And. uh...

123
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.259
Our home isn't that close.
It's a ways from the main road.

124
00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.094
It's a long walk. to the bus.

125
00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:56.762
-And breakfast was very good--
-Yeah. yeah. yeah. enough.

126
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.473
All right. I didn't know you'd come up
with a good excuse. Huh?

127
00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:00.766
You're gonna clean the toilets.

128
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.436
No. I'm... I'm a second-semester senior!

129
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.937
-And?
-Uh. but...

130
00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:10.192
The school rules should be followed
without exceptions.

131
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.277
Right.

132
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:23.623
- Hello.
- Yes. hi.

133
00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:24.790
Hey.

134
00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.834
Slow down. you'll fall.

135
00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.213
I don't know
what they're talking about.

136
00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.382
- Morning.
- Hello.

137
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.967
- Hello.
- Yes. You're doing great.

138
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:38.012
- Hello. sir.
- Yes. hi.

139
00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:40.097
- Hello.
- Hi.

140
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:44.852
Hello.

141
00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:45.978
Hello.

142
00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.814
Hello.

143
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.150
-Yes. hi.
-It was there when you were coming in.

144
00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:52.109
Hmm...

145
00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:57.198
- When?
- Just now.

146
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.623
- You're here. sir.
- Mm.

147
00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:07.583
Hey. We could've greeted you outside.

148
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.876
No need.

149
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.670
Mm.

150
00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.841
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

151
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.602
- It's going well. then?
- Yes.

152
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.028
Then why don't we have a look?

153
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.155
Because of security precautions.
we're unable.

154
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.953
-I have jurisdiction over here.
-Yes. I'm aware of that.

155
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.540
Indeed. I suppose security is crucial.

156
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.210
We've only got one semester. anyhow.

157
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.673
I'll see them then. though?

158
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.594
Ah. don't let me tell you
what to do.

159
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:01.554
-Hm?
-Yeah.

160
00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:04.056
Your contract is ending soon.

161
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.100
So you should start looking
for something long-term.

162
00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:07.017
-Hm?
-Yes.

163
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.729
Sir. I'll do my best.

164
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.357
Keep taking care of this school. Hm?

165
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:15.526
Yes.

166
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.195
I'm going. then.

167
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.448
All right. goodbye. sir. Take care!

168
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.493
You're not gonna say anything?

169
00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:26.996
Goodbye. sir.

170
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.957
So you're a real teacher now?

171
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:32.543
Mm.

172
00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.133
You're going?

173
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:41.844
After I clean this.

174
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:07.161
Whoa.

175
00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:10.623
What's wrong?

176
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.002
Go on.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.189
He's Lee Ganghoon. our class president.

180
00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.942
The cutest guy in the entire school.
hands down.

181
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:42.112
The dude's a genius. and he's athletic
and so good-looking.

182
00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:45.574
tall and a really super smart guy
that can just--

183
00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.660
-Hey. I have to take your phone.
-What?

184
00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:50.079
This isn't a phone. it's a camera. Lee.

185
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.581
Do you really have to take it away?

186
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.333
Just don't film during math.

187
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:55.876
Mm-hm.

188
00:13:56.293 --> 00:13:57.294
Phone. please.

189
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:01.757
So you see that?
He's about as kind as it gets.

190
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.844
No. What? No way.

191
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.764
Whoa! Whoa!

192
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.354
No way! Oh. my gosh.
That's so freaking cool.

193
00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:17.064
Whoa!

194
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.567
Whoa.

195
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:26.448
Wow. that was nuts. This is Kim Bongseok.

196
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.450
What's your channel's name again?

197
00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.244
Han Byul's SeniorSeniorBong.

198
00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.372
<i>Hey. how are you? Kim Bongseok here.</i>

199
00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:35.457
<i>Um. subscribe to SeniorSeniorBong.</i>

200
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:39.128
<i>Also. like it. and stay tuned.
because I'm subscribing as well.</i>

201
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.922
<i>-All right. thanks. Mm.
-Yeah.</i>

202
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.090
Okay. everybody. take a seat.

203
00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:46.010
This year's welcome speech
will be a video of the principal.

204
00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:48.262
What are you looking at. shithead?

205
00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:54.184
Why are you staring at me. huh?

206
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.355
Sit up straight. okay?

207
00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:12.745
COUNSELING IN SESSION

208
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.791
Come on!
I'll only take scholarships in Seoul.

209
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:21.086
Yeah. Let me tell you again. huh?

210
00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.088
With your current grades.

211
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.758
you might only get a scholarship
at a national college.

212
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.302
Look. if I go any farther.

213
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:31.055
it'll cost too much.
food. dorms. transportation.

214
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.432
I'll be staying with my dad.

215
00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:39.855
Let me see here.

216
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.983
Oh! You're good at sports.
What about physical education?

217
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.444
An Art and Phys-Ed College.

218
00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:47.696
Phys-Ed?

219
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.823
Looking at your transcript here.
it's quite good.

220
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.326
And if you get a great score
on the practical exam.

221
00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:55.663
you can get into a four-year
college degree program in Seoul.

222
00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:58.207
and you wouldn't have
to pay an admission fee.

223
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.001
you might even get
a scholarship to that school.

224
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:08.342
Well. still. a PE degree is tough.

225
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:11.095
Aren't those elite schools?

226
00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:12.346
They're very expensive.

227
00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.765
Not all. You don't need to worry about it.

228
00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:16.934
All you have to do
is basic fitness training.

229
00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:18.894
You know there's a track field outside.

230
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.688
You can train and do athletics here.

231
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.773
There's a lot of equipment sitting there.

232
00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:26.944
I'll make sure that you're the only one
who can use it. I'll support you.

233
00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:28.404
You will?

234
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.993
Why are you so nice to me?

235
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.369
Hey. silly bean.

236
00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:38.455
I'm the teacher. you're the student.
Of course. I'll be nice to you.

237
00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:43.293
Oh. well. thank you. sir.
Can I ask one more question?

238
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.920
Go ahead and ask me anything you want.

239
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.215
Could I wear
another school's uniform instead?

240
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:53.637
I've been teaching for 15 years here.

241
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.265
Uh. you might be the first person

242
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.183
who wants to wear
another school's uniform.

243
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.393
You're a strange one. huh?

244
00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.271
JANG HUISOO

245
00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.403
Hello. Jang Huisoo here.

246
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.406
Nice to meet you. guys.

247
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:13.490
That's it?

248
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.409
Introduce yourself.

249
00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:20.581
Um. I used to live in Taebaek. Gangwon.

250
00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:22.499
But I like eating potatoes and corn.

251
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:26.253
and there isn't much to do in Gangwon.
it's a small town.

252
00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:29.715
Anyway. one semester left
and we're almost done.

253
00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.051
You can take
that empty seat there.

254
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.218
Okay.

255
00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:36.221
All right. she's a transfer student.
so be nice to her.

256
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.515
Don't argue.

257
00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.059
- Hey.
- You're all seniors now.

258
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:42.061
Not for long. though.

259
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.312
That is true.

260
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.230
All right. quiet down.

261
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.566
Hey. Mr. Lee. come see
the Guidance Counselor.

262
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:48.650
All right.

263
00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.779
<i>This statement proves
that aspects of life</i>

264
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.697
are reflected in the language.

265
00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.283
Now. based on these facts.

266
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.702
let's take a look
at how the Korean language

267
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:02.873
has changed over time in different eras
and discuss its future trajectory.

268
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:06.960
Ancient Korean...

269
00:18:07.294 --> 00:18:09.546
Yian. why don't you read it?

270
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.506
Sure.

271
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:15.094
"Historically. the time periods
of the Korean language are divided."

272
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:18.222
"The earliest period of Korean
is called Ancient Korean.

273
00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.307
commonly used
until the early tenth century..."

274
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.696
Three-point-one-four-six.
five-nine-three...

275
00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.369
Huh?

276
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:45.290
Three-point-one-four-six.
five-nine-three...

277
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.753
Three-point-one-four-six.

278
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:54.091

279
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.039
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

280
00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:39.047
Jang Huisoo.

281
00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.341
Oh. I don't have a phone. Thanks.

282
00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:44.428
No. the teacher.
he told me to show you the auditorium.

283
00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:45.595
He did. really?

284
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.055
Mm-hm.

285
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.307
Let's go.

286
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:50.642
- Now?
- Yep.

287
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.523
Three-point-one-four-six.
five-nine-three...

288
00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:58.317
GYM

289
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.038
This is not the auditorium. is it?

290
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.375
Lots of our PE classes are held in here.
'cause the field is all dirt.

291
00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:22.716
The standing long jump. and sit-ups.
long-distance running...

292
00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:25.385
Vertical jump.

293
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:28.680
Here. this is the key.
Mr. Choi wanted you to take it.

294
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:31.475
We have two sets of keys.
so you can have the extra one.

295
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.477
Okay. thanks.

296
00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:39.399
I'll do a few laps before I go.

297
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.985
Mm. Lock up before you leave. huh?

298
00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:42.903
Yep.

299
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:01.922
Yeah?

300
00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:05.050
Oh.

301
00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.386
She said she doesn't have a phone.

302
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:09.596
She's running around
the auditorium right now.

303
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.264
Okay. That's all.

304
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:17.938
Sir. Jang Huisoo has an ability?
Is it just like mine?

305
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.193
Yeah. both of you are alike.

306
00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:28.657
We're gonna keep an eye on her. Relax.

307
00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:33.245
Is that it?

308
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.206
Yes.

309
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.209
You should relax.

310
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:47.509
STUDENT RECORDS

311
00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:58.895
I feel like I could fly.

312
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:04.443
Hm...

313
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:09.573
Ah. it's not as dirty as I thought.
I'll be quick.

314
00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:14.327
Now. shall we start?

315
00:24:54.117 --> 00:24:55.202
Okay.

316
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.497
Come on. let's get to work.

317
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.790
- Let's work harder!
- Louder.

318
00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.792
- Let's work harder!
- Hey. excuse me.

319
00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:03.919
What do you need?

320
00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:06.129
Delivery.

321
00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:09.299
-Just leave it there.
-No. no. no. directly.

322
00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:11.885
Uh. I have to deliver it in person.

323
00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:13.970
Who is it addressed to?

324
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:15.555
Jincheon.

325
00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:16.848
Jincheon?

326
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:21.436
There's no one here by that name.
You sure that's right?

327
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.437
Guys.

328
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.816
Go have some lunch now.

329
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.236
It's not lunchtime yet. though.

330
00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:34.991
It's time to have lunch. right now!

331
00:25:50.757 --> 00:25:53.468
Jincheon. your name. right?

332
00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:55.178
Hey.

333
00:25:56.846 --> 00:25:58.515
How'd you find that out?

334
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:03.144
Right there. it's in black and white.

335
00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.354
And what is that?

336
00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:06.356
List. retired.

337
00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.316
Uh. hm...

338
00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:12.195
You're retired. This is the list.

339
00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:15.532
-A list of retirees?
-Uh-huh.

340
00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:18.034
And so what. there's a list.
what about it. hm?

341
00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.331
Why don't you explain exactly

342
00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:26.334
why you've come over here?

343
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.920
In detail. please.

344
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:29.838
Oh. I'm sorry.

345
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.840
I. uh... Where are my manners?

346
00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.217
Oh. now you have manners?

347
00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.136
Sometimes I do.

348
00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:39.681
Let me ask you. again.

349
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.561
Why on earth are you here now?

350
00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:52.402
To delete you.

351
00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:54.904
Delete. huh?

352
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:57.616
Come here. Jincheon.

353
00:26:58.783 --> 00:26:59.868
I have to explain?

354
00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:01.828
Come here.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.504
So you didn't make a deal
with your teacher?

448
00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.422

Jincheon is dead? How?

476
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:13.856
Fell out a window.

477
00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:17.485
But there were signs
of an attempted strangulation.

478
00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:20.446
Scars on his neck
from broken bones show he was choked.

479
00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:23.908
and we have evidence
of a violent fight in his hideout.

480
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:28.746
So then. who was it?

481
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:30.790
We're still confirming.

482
00:37:37.129 --> 00:37:39.966

How did we wrap up the case?

484
00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:45.137
We ruled it as an accidental death.

485
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.932
So it won't garner much attention
from the press.

486
00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:48.975
But...

487
00:37:49.475 --> 00:37:51.602
...there is the issue of social media.

488
00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:55.606
We will erase it all.
but it's going to take some time.
