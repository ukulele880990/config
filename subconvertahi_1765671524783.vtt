Hello. everyone!

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:19.102
I'm Orangibberish. and I always get
to the truth behind the rumors.

5
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.605
Okay. today. I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombies rumor.

6
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.959
I'm on my way to see
if it's really turned into Zombieland

7
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.193
like they've been saying online
and on social media.

[Orangibberish] Do you see that?

16
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.253
It's bumper to bumper
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

17
00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:46.629
There are so many cars.

18
00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.756
Hold on.

19
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.966
I'm gonna have to get out
and hike my way in.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.470
[Orangibberish] I came up the mountain
to avoid the traffic jam.

See that there?

22
00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.950

Yeah.

118
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:19.808
Maybe they didn't die. then.

119
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.901
They wouldn't have been quiet
if zombies were biting them.

120
00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:26.529

No one answers me.
I'm always talking to myself.

124
00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:42.044
- I think you're right.
- Forget it.

125
00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.422
I didn't hear anything. either.

126
00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:45.715
Me neither.

127
00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:50.928
I was scared because I didn't know
how I'd feel if I heard them screaming.

128
00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:52.805
but I didn't hear anything.

129
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.766
Come to think of it. neither did I.

130
00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.270
Then I'm right. They're alive. right?

131
00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:02.398
Should she be alive?

132
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:04.942
What do you mean?

133
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:09.530
She's a murderer.

134
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.034
[Ji-min] She killed Gyeong-su
and walked out of here on her own.

135
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.579
Is it even right for her to be alive?
Aren't you all being fake?

136
00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:17.747
What about Miss Park?

137
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:20.374
Should she have died too?

138
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.709
[Ji-min] Is that our fault?

139
00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.504
Either way. we're responsible
for what happened.

140
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:25.587
Why is that?

141
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:27.882
What did we do wrong?

142
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.052
Na-yeon killed someone.
then played the victim.

143
00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.553
and chose to leave on her own...

144
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.807
because we didn't listen to her.

145
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.228
If no one's on your side.
is it okay to kill?

146
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.273
[Ji-min] Miss Park acted
like we were wrong.

147

We didn't tell Na-yeon to go out there.

148

We didn't tell Miss Park
to go out there. either.

Am I the only one?

157
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.131
I do.

158
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.509
We have to go. too. actually.

159
00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.136

I told you no one would come.

163
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.911
No one cares about this school.

164
00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.748
If they did.
they would've saved us by now.

165
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.761
So we wouldn't have been
attacked like that.

[Cheol-su sighs]

167
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.861

would burn down.

Till nothing's left.

169
00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.825
They'll save us.

170
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:06.999
They just have to.

I know you wanna live.

181
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.418
You wanna live so badly...

182
00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:54.547
that you want to die.

183
00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:01.429
Why are you blaming me for this?
Su-hyeok brought it up.

184
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.639
Pooping's not a crime.

185
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.101
It's not a crime. but...

186
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:09.395
But what? Don't you need to go?

187
00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:11.647
Yes. I do.

188
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:15.359
- Not poop. but. you know...
- What about you?

189
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.364
I don't... Pooping? No.

190
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.367
Don't you need to go?

191
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.202
Why are you asking me?

192
00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.246
Why are you getting annoyed?

193
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.374
What do you want from us?
We can't go out. anyway.

194
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.336
[breathes deeply]

195
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920
I have an idea.

196
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.052
[Dae-su] First...

197
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:44.430
The girls and the guys will take turns.

198
00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:45.848
Where?

199
00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:47.808
Here.

200
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:50.269
[Hyo-ryeong] You're crazy.

201
00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:51.854
Stop it. man.

202
00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:52.938
[Dae-su] Why?

203
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:57.109
The girls can wait in the other room.
and the guys can just pee out the window.

204
00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.320
What about... poop?

205
00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:01.780
Poop. Well...

206
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.950
You can take off your pants
and hang out the window.

207
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:06.701
Like this.

208
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.620
Outside.

209
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.540
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

210
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.685
- Like this.
- [Wu-jin] What reaction is he hoping for?

211
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:15.836
- [Hyo-ryeong] Stop being ridiculous.
- [both sigh]

212
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.422
But someone has to hold you.
so you don't fall.

213
00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.049
How are you going to wipe your butt?

214
00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.320
- Well. someone else should.
- [Hyo-ryeong] What is he saying?

215
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.344
Idiot.

216
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.472
Let's just hold it.

217
00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:29.266
If the rescuers come...

218
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.143
It'll take a while for them to get here.

219
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.606
It may be the same outside of the school.

220
00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:38.775
[On-jo] I don't know
how long we'll be stuck here.

221
00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.277
but my dad always told me

222
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.655
to separate the bathroom
from where you sleep

223
00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.198
if you find yourself stranded.

224
00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.700
Where will we create a bathroom and how?

225
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:48.994
Right there.

226
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.709
- Yes. sir.
- [zombies gagging]

227
00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.087
- They're sending a chopper.
- [sighs]

228
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.548
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

229
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.181
What do you mean.
we have to go out to the roof

230
00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:05.698
when it's swarming with the infected?

231
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:08.430
Also. 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?

232
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.599
Why can't you arrange it
for 11:00 p.m. tonight?

233
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.352
Yes. tomorrow. We'll spend the night here.

234
00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:17.982
How can the assemblywoman sleep here?
Radio in again!

235
00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.544
We'll have to stay here tonight.
so you're gonna have to create

236
00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:21.777
a temporary bathroom.

237
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.320
- U-sin.
- Yes. sir.

238
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:28.659
[sighs]

239
00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:35.416
Nam-ra and you guys. try to look
for something to cover the window.

240
00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:36.333
Okay.

241
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.335
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong.

242
00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:42.089
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

243
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.383
Cheong-san.

244
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.846
And then the rest of you...

245
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.514
A screen?

246
00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.182
- A screen?
- Yes. a screen to block.

247
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.022
MUSIC 3

248
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:04.778
Come with me. Come on.

249
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:06.655
- That's the bathroom.
- [scoffs]

250
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.739
[Dae-su groans]

251
00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.630
[Joon-yeong] Put this in here.

252
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.966
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

253
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.384
Oh. okay.

254
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.555
Okay. We're all gonna
use this as a toilet.

255
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.308
so that it will absorb urine and feces
as much as possible.

256
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:38.562
[Cheong-san] Put this in there too.

257
00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.608
Dae-su's got a big butt. so let's...

258
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:46.320
- [On-jo] Why don't we tape CDs up there?
- [tape screeching]

259
00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:49.573
- One more?
- Is there more tape?

260
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:50.783
[tape screeching]

261
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.497
- [clanking]
- [grunting]

262
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.669
[boys grunt]

263
00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:04.505
What's going on?
Did they make the toilet yet?

264
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:05.756
What's taking them so long?

265
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.844
[Joon-yeong] That's good.

266
00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.222
- This should be good enough.
- [Joon-yeong] Okay.

267
00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:15.182
[grunts]

268
00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:16.600
[Dae-su] How do we poop on this?

269
00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:19.728
Use the cover for poop.
and without for pee.

270
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:20.646
Get out.

271
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.772
- Oh.
- Out.

272
00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:22.856
How do we use that?

273
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.943
- Get out. Get out. Get out!
- Come on. Don't push me! Aah!

274
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:27.194
- [unzips pants]
- [clangs]

275
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.114
- [urine pattering]
- [sighs]

276
00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:32.491
[Joon-yeong grunting]

277
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:34.994
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there. right?

278
00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:41.792
But if you watch the movies.
they can't do anything. either. right?

279
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.337
Yeah. but they always save everyone
in the end.

280
00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:49.049
[sighs]

281
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.884
- Here's the tissue.
- Pee. Just pee.

282
00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:52.803
- [both sniff]
- [door slams]

283
00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:54.555
- Oh!
- [Su-hyeok] Shit!

284
00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:56.616
- Why don't you just stay inside?
- [Ji-min groans]

285
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.225
- [Dae-su] Does it smell?
- [door slams]

286
00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.935
- Shit.
- [Dae-su] What?

287
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:03.063
Stop being so dramatic.
It doesn't smell at all.

288
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.898
[Hyo-ryeong] Sit somewhere else.

289
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.860
- [exhales deeply]
- There's nobody there.

290
00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.696
There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments out there.

291
00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.282
They all ran away or died.

292
00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:14.658
What do you mean by that?

293
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.618
No one's coming here to save us.

294
00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:20.497
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

295
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:21.582
Don't you know my mom?

296
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:25.586
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me. but she isn't here yet.

297
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:26.795
So. what do you wanna do?

298
00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:30.090
I'm just trying to point out the facts.

299
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.259
We all know that no one's coming.

300
00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:35.363
So I think we should just figure out
what we're gonna do next.

301
00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.181
We have to wait to be rescued.

302
00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:40.225
We can't leave somewhere safe
to go somewhere dangerous.

303
00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:42.728
And what if nobody comes?

304
00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.708
We haven't been waiting that long yet.

305
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.816
How do you think we have to wait?

306
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:51.278
- Do you think we should wait until we die?
- No.

307
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.322
I'm saying let's wait as long as we can.

308
00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.824
There's no way we can go out
right now. anyway.

309
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.178
[Su-hyeok] It's probably
because it's nighttime.

310
00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.579
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning. maybe.

311
00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:02.706
There are a lot of choppers flying around.

312
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.752
Let's just wait until tomorrow.
and we'll see.

313
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:13.926
[gasps]

314
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.477
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

315
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.979
What do you mean?

316
00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.023
You're leaving first
for a personal matter?

317
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.194
How could a firefighter say
something like this during a crisis?

318
00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:34.613
I'll take any punishment
when this is over.

319
00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:35.906
I'll resign if I have to.

320
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:37.908
Listen.

321
00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:40.744
Do you intend to leave all these people
and go by yourself?

322
00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:44.498
You'll abandon your sick colleague
and leave a kid in charge?

323
00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.042
A kid? He's not a kid.

324
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:48.752
He's a firefighter.

325
00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:50.921
[sighs]

326
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:57.844
Fine.

327
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.429
I made a mistake.

328
00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:02.766
Please accept my apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you.

329
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.894
But this isn't just about you.

330
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.189
My daughter is at school...

331
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:12.025
but I can't reach her.

332
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.028
I know she's waiting for me.

333
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.321
[sighs]

334
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.783
I need to go. I'm sorry.

335
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:20.701
Stop. Wait.

336
00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.161
Let me tell you something.

337
00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:31.295
[Eun-hee] His apartment is right there.

338
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.340
If he says he needs to go save his mother.

339
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:37.217
do I let him go?

340
00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:42.014
And she lives right over there.

341
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.184
She has a husband and children.

342
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.895
Is it the right thing to do
to let her leave?

343
00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.399
Knowing they'll all die if they go out?

344
00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.696
I'll go even if I'll die.

345
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.949
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

346
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:06.246
You're a firefighter.

347
00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.498
I'm a politician.

348
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.086
Do you know when it's the hardest
for people like us?

349
00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:15.881
Right now.

350
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.176
Because we have to save the most people.

351
00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:22.554

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:32.479
[Yong-nam] You're so right
about that. sir.

532
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:35.190
You got yourself kicked out
of a pharmaceutical company

533
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.858
and became a substitute teacher.

534
00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:40.028
Our principal took you in
as a permanent member of the faculty.

535
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.571
You should be a team player

536
00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:43.573
and work for the school too.
[clicks tongue]

[exhales heavily]

539
00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:49.662
<i>We transferred him immediately
pretty much to run away.</i>

540
00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:53.249
<i>And they kept finding him
and harassing him.</i>

541
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:56.544
I guess it was fun for them.

542
00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:59.506
Like they're playing with a toy.

543
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.843
[camera shutter clicking]

544
00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.935

545
00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:14.020
Hey. Dad.

546

[clatters]

547
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.860
Just fight back. would you?

548
00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:26.282
Just be a man for once
and fight them back!

549
00:30:29.118 --> 00:30:30.703
I'm sorry. Dad.

550
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.373
I just want to disappear.

551
00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:38.461
That would be easier for me.

552
00:30:40.046 --> 00:30:41.646
[Byeong-chan] <i>That's when I realized it.</i>

553
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:46.010
We live in a system of assault.

554
00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:49.764
A complete nobody like me...

555
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:54.352
can't change the system.

556
00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:56.145
[breathes shakily]

<i>I just hoped he wouldn't die.</i>

561
00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:15.999
<i>I didn't want him
to try and commit suicide again.</i>

562
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.338
[Jae-ik] <i>You created...</i>

563
00:31:26.467 --> 00:31:27.468
<i>a monster.</i>

564
00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:30.597
That's how desperate I was to save him.

565
00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.641
Rather than die as a human.

566
00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:36.561
I wanted him to survive as a monster.

567
00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.773
Don't you realize
that monster is killing everyone?

568
00:31:40.857 --> 00:31:43.443
Who cares if they all die?
They were all complicit.

569
00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:45.361
You crazy asshole.

570
00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:47.864
Who created this world?

571
00:31:47.947 --> 00:31:50.783
I warned that if you ignore it
for being a minor assault.

572
00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:53.036
violence would eventually rule the world.

573
00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.412
But no one listened to me.

574
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:56.664
"It happens."

575
00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.041
"Kids fight."

576
00:31:58.124 --> 00:32:00.126
"They were bullied.
because they deserved it."

577
00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:03.254
The bastards who thought that
and shunned them

578
00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:05.632
made this world the hell
of what it is today!

579
00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:11.054
[breathes shakily]

580
00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:22.190
No. You're the one who made this hellhole.
It's on you.

581
00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:24.692
Maybe as a cop. I'm partly responsible.

582
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:27.838
But what about those people out there
dying without knowing why?

583
00:32:27.862 --> 00:32:30.657
Sure. Maybe they're partly responsible
like you say.

584
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.909
But there are certain things
you must pay with death.

585
00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:35.370
and certain things you must pay
as you live.

586
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:39.332
You wanted to change the world.

587
00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:44.921
Not for everyone to die like this. huh.

588
00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:52.679

589
00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.515
I've tested several sedatives.

Where's the antidote?

594
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.406
Well. there has to be
some kind of treatment.

595
00:33:13.866 --> 00:33:14.866
There's not.

596
00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:26.629
Let's go now. We have to evacuate.

00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:38.579
My brother's a junior.
I'll get him if he's in the classroom.

709
00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:43.792
Hey. Would a zombie really sit
and wait at his desk in his classroom?

710
00:41:45.461 --> 00:41:46.879
Did you see him turn into a zombie?

711
00:41:46.962 --> 00:41:48.464
He may have already.

712
00:41:48.547 --> 00:41:50.216
There's no guarantee he didn't.

713
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:51.675
Shut up.

714
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:53.511
Why are you arguing?

715
00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:54.887
Just fight. okay?

716
00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.181
Sorry.

717
00:42:01.977 --> 00:42:03.395
Come with me if you want.

718
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:11.362
She's so cool. Fuck.

719
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.364
So annoying.

720
00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:18.452
[sighs]
Wait up.

721
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.955
They'll come for us eventually.

722
00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.498
How long do we wait?

723
00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:24.332
Until they come.

724
00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.835
There's no guarantee they'll come. though.

725
00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:29.880
So? You want to go out there?

726
00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:32.883
Even if they come. they won't find us
if they don't know we're here.

727
00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:35.302
Well. we can put up a sign for help.

728
00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.262
[Ji-min] How?

729
00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:40.182
I remember my dad taught me
a signal that's used internationally.

730
00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:41.892
[Hyo-ryeong] What is it?

[So-ju] Hey. have another bite. Okay?

733
00:42:46.855 --> 00:42:48.524
[So-ju] Hey. kid!

734
00:42:48.607 --> 00:42:52.194
It was red and blue arranged together

735
00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:57.950
to create some sort of a pattern.

736
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.293
Should we write "SOS" on a curtain. maybe?

737
00:43:07.876 --> 00:43:09.044
Yeah. let's do that.

738
00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.550
[Nam-ra] We can't last long. anyway.

739
00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:15.926
Three minutes without oxygen.

740
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.010
three days without water.
three weeks without food.

741
00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:19.221
What's that?

742
00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:21.223
How long a person can survive.

743
00:43:21.307 --> 00:43:24.727
It's only been a day. you know.
We have to try the best we can.

744
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:28.731
We'll show signs of dehydration today.

745
00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:30.454
And we won't be able to move by tomorrow.

746
00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:32.192
What are you trying to say?

747
00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:34.755
Are you saying we should go out. or...

748
00:43:36.238 --> 00:43:40.075
are you saying we'll die. anyway.
so we shouldn't bother doing anything?

749
00:43:46.999 --> 00:43:47.999
I don't know.

750
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:49.752
Then don't say anything.

751
00:43:52.254 --> 00:43:56.884
I think the prez means we should think
about anything else that we can do.

752
00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.177
[Su-hyeok] Right?

753
00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:01.221
- No.
- No?

754
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:04.058
We don't know anything at all.

755
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.894
We need to know something
before we can make plans.

756
00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:09.457
- [Ji-min] What more do we need to know?
- What Nam-ra means...

757
00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:12.399
You don't know what she's saying. either.

758
00:44:13.442 --> 00:44:14.442
No.

759
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.865
Are you saying we need to understand
the situation in order to take action?

760
00:44:19.948 --> 00:44:22.660
Yes. that's right.

761
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.244
Well. I totally agree with that.

762
00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:28.290
We need more information to decide
whether to wait. run. or get out.

763
00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:31.418
What can we find out on this situation.
and also. how?

764
00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.754
We can check online
if we have a cell phone.

765
00:44:35.255 --> 00:44:36.590
But we don't.

to find his phone if they came. but...
