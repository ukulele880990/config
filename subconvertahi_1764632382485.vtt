﻿1
00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.801
Welcome to the
end of your movie.

2
00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:12.721
No fucking way.

3
00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.306
But I would much rather have taken
Marshall out up close. you know?

4
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.561
I truly don't know how you
make words like that arousing.

5
00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:21.563
I got married in this
courtyard. you know?

6
00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.857
-Middle of the night with just the stars.
-Yeah. uh-huh.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.275
-And the fountain as our witness.
-Uh-huh.

8
00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.027
-I think it's good luck.
-Yeah. have a good day.

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.320
Eh. having a wedding.
We'll have a good day.

10
00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.948
Nicky Caccimelio. the dry
cleaning king of Brooklyn.

11
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.450
has been reported missing.

12
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.703
The officials say they do not
suspect foul play at this time.

13
00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.830
Mr. Savage. Miss Mora.

14
00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.417
I wanna hire you to find my
husband. Nicky Caccimelio.

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.461
We only investigate
murders in the building.

16
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.504
Sofia Caccimelio.

17
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.298
Call if you change your mind.

18
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.632
Oh. my God.

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.635
Lester? Lester!

20
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.268
Lester Herbert Coluca was born

21
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.188
in Flatbush. Brooklyn in 1948.

22
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.026
He went on to serve
32 years as doorman

23
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.654
for the iconic Arconia building
on the Upper West Side.

24
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.870
Lester is survived by
his wife. Lorraine.

25
00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.039
and two children. Frank and May.

26
00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.085
"In lieu of flowers.
please send donations

27
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.046
"to the National Audubon
Birdwatching Society

28
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.173
or the Hollywood Improv East."

29
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.051
That's it? Four lines?

30
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.595
This is a crime against obits.

31
00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.514
Where's the color? The texture?

32
00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.016
The... the charming anecdote
that makes everyone say.

33
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.810
"That's our guy."

34
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.269
They should have come to me.

35
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:47.148
Come to you? Not like
his wife or kids. maybe?

36
00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:51.820
Yes. to me. the man that... that
Lester used to whisper to on the daily.

37
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.031
"Hey there. favorite
tenant o' mine."

38
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.615
You're more upset
about that obit

39
00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.201
than when the police declared
Lester's death an accident.

40
00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.870
No. don't even get me
started on that one.

41
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.455
I'm upset about it all.

42
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:03.998
I loved that man.

43
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.792
The only thing I ever
saw was you accusing him

44
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.211
of pilching pepperonis
from your pizza delivery.

45
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.879
Well. he was a
pepperoni pilcher.

46
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.048
But that's what besties
do. they rib each other.

47
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.299
You wouldn't get it.

48
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:17.470
Ugh. I can't believe you're eating
four-day-old wedding shrimp.

49
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.848
Well. you can eat it for five
days if it's been on ice.

50
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.225
Six if you've recently
had salmonella.

51
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.312
Mm! I can't believe the
caterers forgot to serve this.

52
00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.356
You just don't seem
like a shrimp guy.

53
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.609
Ah. shrimp is but the vessel
for the heavenly cocktail sauce.

54
00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.821
Plus. I hate waste.

55
00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.490
I'm so depressed.

56
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:40.827
Why does it smell like I'm down
at the piers cruising the docks?

57
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.872
Howard. I am not a fan of
this just-walking-in trend.

58
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.000
I don't care to live inside an
episode of Laverne and Shirley.

59
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.668
Howard. what's wrong?

60
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:51.504
Ah. thank you for asking. Mabel.

61
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:54.549
Sevelyn and Gravey are so in
love. it's like I don't exist.

62
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.676
Jonathan is still on tour
with Thoroughly Modern Millie.

63
00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.721
Hopefully not getting thoroughly
Millied by some chorus boy.

64
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.139
I don't know what that means.

65
00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.141
So. I'm left alone
with this pet couple

66
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.935
who expect me to wait
on them hand and paw.

67
00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.355
Hold on. How much
shrimp do you have left?

68
00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.983
-There's a second case in the fridge.
-I can buy their love.

69
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.405
Well. I suppose we
should get going?

70
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:22.035
Such an unusual request Lester
made. to lie in state in our lobby.

71
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:26.080
I was just down there doing a lap.
trying to get a sense of the buzz.

72
00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.625
Biggest headline is the
security camera footage.

73
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.668
Let me guess. So. Lester's death

74
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.795
wasn't a tragic
accident after all.

75
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.589
Well. I mean. it is the Arconia.

76
00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:38.593
When we found him. nothing
about that looked accidental.

77
00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:40.303
Whoa there. Sherlock
Nursing Holmes.

78
00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.930
Good one. Howard.

79
00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:45.183
The footage sadly confirms Lester's
death was tragically accidental.

80
00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.978
The buzz is about whether or
not the new doorman is hot.

81
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.689
I've tallied 15
smashes. two passes.

82
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.650
and one abstain from No Fun Uma.

83
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.736
Anyway. I'll see you downstairs.
After I feed the lovers.

84
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.864
So. it was a tragic accident?

85
00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.367
I don't know.

86
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.868
Still seems...

87
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.329
well. a little fishy.

88
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.331
It's probably for the best.

89
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.541
No murder means no podcast.

90
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.962
No podcast means I get to
enjoy being a newlywed.

91
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.799
You get to be a 30-something
in the city. and you get to...

92
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.426
I don't know what you do.

93
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.388
What? Oh. I got stuff.

94
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.556
I don't really know
what to say to that.

95
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.975
-Oliver.
-No. no. Mabel.

96
00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.436
Truthfully. I've seen his stuff.
and it's nothing to gloat about.

97
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.896
-Oliver.
-Oh. have I crossed a line. Charles?

98
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.690
Oliver!

99
00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.192
-What?
-Why does the shrimp you're holding

100
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.777
have a fingernail?

101
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.074

102
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.047
It is a finger. right?

103
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.007
I don't think it's a toe.

104
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.760
Is it a male finger? Female?

105
00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.428
I can't even tell
what race it is.

106
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.097
I think its main
attribute is dead.

107
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.976
Looks like there's some sort
of green fungus on the nail?

108
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.311
Don't pick it up!

109
00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:55.271
-She picked it up.
-I knew she would!

110
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.107
Okay. Oliver. did
anyone at your wedding

111
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.526
mention an accident
in the kitchen?

112
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.113
Yes. Mabel. but I
kept it to myself.

113
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.281
Do better!

114
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.618
Please. nobody accidentally
slices off their finger

115
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:12.121
and then accidentally puts it
into a vintage shrimp goblet.

116
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.332
He's right. We gotta
quit saying "accident."

117
00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.667
This is a message.

118
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.045
Ugh. So creepy.

119
00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:20.922
It's like the horse
head in The Godfather.

120
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:22.215
Very mobby.

121
00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:24.759
Hey.

122
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.140
Sofia Caccimelio.

123
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.558
Who is that? What's that?

124
00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:36.187
On your wedding night.
the night Lester died.

125
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.191
-this mysterious woman...
-A real. uh. femme fatale.

126
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:45.696
...asked us to help her find her
missing mobster husband. Nicky.

127
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.074
A mob wife?! And
what did you say?

128
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.076
That we weren't a
detective agency.

129
00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.953
You turned down a mob wife?!

130
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.579
Oh. my God.

131
00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.542
Show me a photo of
Sofia Caccimelio.

132
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.713
Oh. look at them. A
classic mob couple.

133
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.508
No honest man wears
a flower that big.

134
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.428
They came to you on the
night of my wedding.

135
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.556
and you turn them down without
considering the consequences.

136
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.266
The Godfather. I know that one.

137
00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.268
Fantastic. The
education is taking.

138
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.978
-That's a good Brando.
-That was a good Brando.

139
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.813
-Thank you.
-But you need to jut your chin out

140
00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.024
a little. scratch your face
with the back of your knuckles.

141
00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.234
Hey. buckie. you gotta get
your voice a little bit deeper.

142
00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:24.861
-Get it. my voice a little low.
-I came to you...

143
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.947
Yeah. I made him an offer
he couldn't. uh. decline.

144
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.366
Okay. you know what? I'm so
sorry that I started this.

145
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.994
Can we please get back
to the fishy finger?

146
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.122
Whose could it be?

147
00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:44.297
Did anyone check to see if Lester
had all his fingers in the fountain?

148
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.051
Alright. We just need a
quick peek at his digits.

149
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.220
-Get in. get out.
-Shouldn't be too hard.

150
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.223
I mean. I loved the man.
but I... I can't imagine

151
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.057
we'll be fighting off crowds.

152
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.608
Is this how we find out
that Lester was a Kennedy?

153
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.776
I don't know an eighth
this many people.

154
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.196
What's Mayor Tillman doing here?

155
00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:10.531
-Oh. my goodness.
-Hi.

156
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.205
Excuse me... Mm-hmm.

157
00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.790
Uh. if I could have everybody's
attention for just a moment.

158
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:20.875
Thank you.

159
00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.003
Friends. family.

160
00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:25.838
and... and. of course.

161
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.591
dear Lorraine. I am here today

162
00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.135
because I love Lester...

163
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.180
who I did not know.

164
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.268
But I do love a great doorman.

165
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.813
And even better. a
collection of doormen.

166
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.566
That's a key voting
bloc. Union strong.

167
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.528
This building has seen
too much pain recently.

168
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.988
and I just wanted
to stop by and say

169
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.241
I stand with you all

170
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.661
in respecting the old
guard. like Lester.

171
00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:01.332
Protecting while also
bringing new life back

172
00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:03.626
to a new New York.

173
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.836
We love you. buddy.

174
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.547
Rest in strength. Mister...

175
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.759
Coluca. Blessed be.

176
00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:14.762
Also. also. uh. let us not
forget that the election

177
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:18.683
is right around the corner. so
please. um. uh. get out to the polls.

178
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:20.101
Thank you very much.

179
00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:21.769
Thank you.

180
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.439
Wow. that guy has rizz.

181
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.275
-Oliver!
-What? You taught me "rizz."

182
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.361
-No. You didn't do the assignment?
-How could you?

183
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.071
Assignment? I didn't know
there was an assignment.

184
00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:35.366
They asked us to send a photo
of ourselves with Lester.

185
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:36.784
There was a whole email.

186
00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:38.911
Oh. I unsubscribed
to all Arconia emails

187
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.081
after Howard kept spamming
us with his Dua Lipa fan fic.

188
00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:44.625
Aw. Lester.

189
00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:46.919
We're gonna miss you. buddy.

190
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.046
We really will.

191
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:56.804
Wait.

192
00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:59.140
He's not doing the
dead man's arm cross.

193
00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:02.435
How can I count his fingers if he's
not doing the dead man's arm cross?

194
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.229
Maybe because his finger
was chopped off by the mob?

195
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.648
Alright. um. change of plan.

196
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.192
Uh. you... you go. uh.
talk to Lester's wife.

197
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.236
and... express
your condolences.

198
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.697
-Oh. Lillian loves me.
-It's Lorraine.

199
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.198
Lorraine loves me. too.

200
00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.284
And... and then. you
just. uh. gently ask

201
00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:20.870
if Lester had all his
fingers when he died.

202
00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.705
Oh. he gently asks that?

203
00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:25.499
Because shouting it
would be inappropriate.

204
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.834
What are you gonna do?

205
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.254
I'm gonna work my way in there.

206
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.423
Best distance
ourselves from him.

207
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.802
Lester's building ledger?

208
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.930
Mrs. Coluca. please. I...

209
00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.308
He'd want you to have it.

210
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:46.729
And besides. I think you might find
some very interesting tidbits in here.

211
00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:49.440
My husband was nothing
if not thorough.

212
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:50.691
Hi. Excuse me.

213
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:51.817
-Hello.
-Hi.

214
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.362
Well. we just wanted to
say how sorry we are.

215
00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.989
Mabel Mora. formerly
12E. now the West Tower.

216
00:10:57.073 --> 00:11:00.951
Oh. Mabel. thank you. The
tenants were like family to him.

217
00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:04.497
Yeah. well. and since we're all family.
we were hoping you could tell us.

218
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.791
uh. when you saw
him the last time.

219
00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:10.920
did you happen to notice if
he was... fully complete?

220
00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:13.881
Fully complete?

221
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.040
Okay. so let's. uh. get
one where I look solemn.

222
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.777
Oh! Charles-Haden Savage?

223
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.987
Well. the mayor's
a fan of Brazzos.

224
00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:39.115
Uh. Bra-who?

225
00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.034
No. no. I'm a huge
fan of the pod.

226
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.119
Right.

227
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.329
You know what would be good?

228
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.747
An endorsement.

229
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.874
Between the three of you.
you cover every demo.

230
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.710
I mean. you're gay. right?

231
00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.002
Mm. Yeah. a little.

232
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.838
-Oh. well. got it. Close enough.
-Yeah.

233
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.506
So. could I be on the show?

234
00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:58.467
Oh. well. uh. sorry.
but we're apolitical.

235
00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.927
-Ah. yeah.
-Yeah.

236
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.512
-Damn.
-Yeah.

237
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:05.015
Well. uh. if you change
your minds. here's my card.

238
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.350
Romy.

239
00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.311
-Thank you.
-Thank you. yeah.

240
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.068
Oh. my God. Lester.

241
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:20.114
Oh... What the hey?

242
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.410
Lester.

243
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.751
Oh. what a lovely
tribute. Rainey.

244
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:35.546
I just wish I'd gotten the
chance to clean his hat first.

245
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:38.841
You know. it was stained with
blood from that fountain.

246
00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:42.720
and he took such pride
in his appearance.

247
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:45.264
and I just... he wouldn't
have wanted that.

248
00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:48.726
It's true. it's true. In
all the years I knew him.

249
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:51.353
I don't think I ever saw
a wrinkle on his sleeve.

250
00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.564
Yes. I'm sorry.
what's your name?

251
00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.941
-Uh...
-Oliver Putnam. 10D.

252
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.778
Oh. you're 10D?

253
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.614
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
no. I... I... I'm 10C.

254
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:02.823
-Oh!
-Yeah.

255
00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.825
Sorry. you are 10D.

256
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.869
I... I just delivered you
Dude Wipes and a Playbill mag

257
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.121
with a spotlight
on Victor Garber.

258
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.747
-Mm!
-Excuse me. who are you?

259
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.751
Oliver. this is Randall. Lester's
trainee. and the new doorman.

260
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.669
Also. played upright
bass at your wedding.

261
00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.047
-Oh.
-Putnam.

262
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.674
You're the cuckoo chick!

263
00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.635
Excuse me. I'm the cuckoo what?

264
00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:24.386
Cuckoo chick!

265
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.809
Lester likened all the tenants
to birds. his favorite hobby.

266
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:32.728
And you were the cuckoo chick!

267
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.855
The neediest bird
of all. the taker.

268
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.983
The taker? I was your
husband's favorite tenant.

269
00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.193
I am no taker.

270
00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:40.862
Well. clearly. the one
thing you never took

271
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.613
-was a picture with Lester.
-Oop.

272
00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:50.538
Jesus Christ.

273
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.333
Hi. everybody. Hi.
I'm... I'm Mabel.

274
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.752
I used to visit this building

275
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.505
when I was a little
kid to visit my aunt.

276
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:02.716
You know. the term "doorman"

277
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.511
always seemed unfair because
Lester did way more than

278
00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:06.888
just open the door.

279
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.558
One time. uh. my mom
forgot my birthday.

280
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.685
so I checked in with
Lester every hour

281
00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:14.937
to see if she had sent
something. but she hadn't.

282
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.648
And then. Lester showed
up with a package

283
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.651
and said he'd found
it in the back.

284
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:23.529
It was a sketching pad. I...
He knew I loved to draw.

285
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.492
-One. two...
-Um. uh. Lester was such a kind

286
00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.951
-and thoughtful man.
-Three...

287
00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.035
-Hmm?
-Um.

288
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:31.871
-I don't think he'd admit this...
-Three. four...

289
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.999
...but he'd go out of his way to
save a little girl's birthday.

290
00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:36.709
What the fuck are you doing?!

291
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:43.799
Oh. my God. is he
touching my husband?

292
00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.844
He's doing it for Lester.

293
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.224
We're all going to hell.

294
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:56.061
So. all that feeling around. and
you couldn't get a finger count?

295
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.772
It was either eight or
11. He had gloves on.

296
00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.066
Eleven? How could it be 11?

297
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.610
You don't wanna know.

298
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.737
Check it out. folks!

299
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.990
10D found proof of his
deep care for the man.

300
00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.533
A photo of us from my wedding.

301
00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:12.661
Admittedly. it's
not the best photo.

302
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.706
but that's Lester looking
joyful in the deep back.

303
00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:18.834
beside my half-blurred face
and my fully blurred arm.

304
00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.462
Uh. yeah. whoa. that...
that's a beauty.

305
00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:24.089
Okay. fine. Okay. it's
not perfect but...

306
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.008
Is that a new swivel?

307
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.094
And I like this wallpaper.
Someone's been busy around here.

308
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.597
-It's getting there.
-She's leveling up.

309
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.308
Right? Then again. I
found finger shrimp

310
00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:36.310
and got booed out of a wake.

311
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.064
This...

312
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.360
Hold on. You guys. come here.

313
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.950
-Is that Nicky Caccimelio?
-That's him.

314
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:54.453
The missing mobster was at your wedding?
The whole town is looking for him.

315
00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:57.665
-And he's talking with Lester.
-And handing him an envelope.

316
00:15:57.748 --> 00:16:00.626
So. Lester had a run-in
with the missing mobster

317
00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:03.754
the night he accidentally
died? I don't buy that.

318
00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:05.756
What if Nicky killed Lester?

319
00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:08.467
Now. now. now. now. no. no.
no. Le... Let's not lead to...

320
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.678
Lester was killed in a mob hit?!

321
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.304
That's it. I'm texting Howard.

322
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.473
We need to see that
Arconia footage

323
00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:17.601
that proved the cause
of Lester's death.

324
00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:18.769
That's good.

325
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:21.605
But we need to talk to
Nicky's wife. Sofia.

326
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.691
We need to go to Staten Island.

327
00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:26.735
We need to go
face-to-face with the mob.

328
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.029
Ah. well. you two
have fun with that.

329
00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.657
-And let me know how it goes.
-Excuse me?

330
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.325
No. I don't do the mob.

331
00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.035
Very little I won't do.

332
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:37.871
A musical about
9/11? Took that call.

333
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.332
But the mob? Nope.
Don't do the mob.

334
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:43.752
Oliver. we have dealt with
very threatening people before.

335
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.504
Why is this so different?

336
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.799
In '82...

337
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:54.013
I wrote a show called
Newark. Newark.

338
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.098
If you could make it there.

339
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.558
it turns out it has no bearing

340
00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.321
on whether or not you
can make it anywhere.

341
00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:03.981
Anyway. despite a towering score

342
00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:06.859
and relatable nods
to airport traffic...

343
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.612
I had trouble finding investors.

344
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.616
So. I borrowed from the mob.

345
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.076
How much?

346
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.705
Four hundred dollars.

347
00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:23.709
Yeah. I know. I know
what you're thinking.

348
00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:26.378
"It's a miracle he's not
ass up in the East River."

349
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:31.633
But now. I am a newly wedded man
with a ring finger to protect.

350
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:34.094
So. Oliver Putnam
is staying put here.

351
00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:36.555
Okay. Good.

352
00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.183
But you seem awfully concerned

353
00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:42.561
with how people perceive your
relationship with Lester.

354
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:45.564
What if I told you that
going was the best way

355
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:48.067
to prove how much you care?

356
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.694
-I have nothing to prove.
-Fine.

357
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.405
Charles and I will start
our newest podcast.

358
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:57.117
solve Lester's murder. and we
will reap in the glory alone.

359
00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.911
And I wish you luck.

360
00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.162
-Bye-bye!
-Bye.

361
00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.246
Bye.

362
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:12.758
The silence is
deafening. I'm coming!

363
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.679
-Took you long enough. Come on.
-Jesus.

364
00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.627
I still can't believe how casually
you put that rogue human finger

365
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.462
-in that fancy cup.
-Ugh.

366
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.339
It's dishwasher-safe.

367
00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:54.175
But thank you for reminding me.

368
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:56.176
I keep wanting to
take a sip from it.

369
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.930
Alright. if we are onto
something. we'll need audio.

370
00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:01.598
So. quick. somebody old

371
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:02.975
talk about the mafia.

372
00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:06.770
Oh. uh. well. okay. You
wanna know about the mob. eh?

373
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:10.274
New York's most powerful
and dangerous famiglia.

374
00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:13.068
Alright. I'm sorry I even asked.

375
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:16.864
We cannot lean into offensive
Italian stereotypes.

376
00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:19.575
They live in the
Godfather house.

377
00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.451
See. that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

378
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:23.787
No. no. Mabel. No. no. it...

379
00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:26.165
It's literally the house
from The Godfather.

380
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:34.047
-Hey. how should we handle this?
-Delicately.

381
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.841
You already rejected her once.

382
00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:38.010
Okay. just let me
take the lead. then.

383
00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:39.094
Okay.

384
00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.735
-Buongiorno. signore!
-Oh. this is how I die.

385
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.905
I am Charles and these
are my friends...

386
00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.990
I know who you are. huh?

387
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.868
Come in. Let's go.

388
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:13.420
If only these
walls could scream.

389
00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:15.422
Uh. what a beautiful home.

390
00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:17.925
This must be the
original molding.

391
00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:19.968
And the original nonna.

392
00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.852
Mm. easy for you to say.

393
00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.855
-Yo. let's go.
-Yeah.

394
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:37.736
Please. please. this way.

395
00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:39.571
-Thank you.
-Let's go. let's go.

396
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.575
-Right. yeah.
-Please. please. thank you.

397
00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:46.078
Gentlemen. we've got company.

398
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.331
Oh.

399
00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:50.708
Jesus. how many are there?

400
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.669
It looks like a community
theater audition for Grease.

401
00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:56.213
I'm Johnny. These
here are my brothers.

402
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.048
Tony. Mikey. Vinny.

403
00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:59.591
And Braden.

404
00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.385
Braden. Right.

405
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.514
-Suits you.
-Nice to meet yous.

406
00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:07.432
You guys are the
podcasters. right?

407
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.601
So. you like tellin'
stories? Which is good.

408
00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:12.896
'cause my brothers and I.
we got a story for you.

409
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.481
-Sit down.
-Oh. uh. no. we're actually.

410
00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:16.984
we're fine standing because it
was a long. uh. drive and...

411
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.193
Hey!

412
00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:20.570
Sit down.

413
00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.447
-Yes. alright.
-Sitting.

414
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:23.657
There we go.

415
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.410
Ah. this is better.

416
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:30.163
The year. 1970.

417
00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:33.417
Anthony "Tony Plate" owns a
restaurant in Little Italy.

418
00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:36.086
-It's a popular spot.
-Hmm.

419
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:37.171
Partially because of their

420
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:38.964
highly fuckable tortellini.

421
00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:41.591
But mostly because of
their faithful clientele.

422
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:44.344
like Paul Gambino. head of
the Gambino crime family.

423
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.096
-Hmm.
-You hear that. Oliver?

424
00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:49.141
Me? Yes. why? Do... do I
not look like I'm listening?

425
00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:51.476
One night. the Gambinos
approached Tony

426
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.855
with a work opportunity. much
like Sofia approached you.

427
00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:57.733
But Tony refused.

428
00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:02.696
Naturally. the Gambinos found
this to be a bit disrespectful.

429
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:06.658
You see. respect is
everything to the mob.

430
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:08.076
Right. Oliver?!

431
00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:10.704
A-Again. I am listening.

432
00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:15.042
Is it my eyes? I... I
worry one has gone lazy.

433
00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:18.462
Few days later. Tony's
place was torched.

434
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.006
They fried him like an off-menu

435
00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:22.466
-Fritto Misto.
-Mm.

436
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:24.259
Why?

437
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:28.138
'Cause when the mob offers
you an opportunity...

438
00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:30.015
You say...

439
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.101
Yes.

440
00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:34.770
Or soon.

441
00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.480
you'll be sayin' nothing at all.

442
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:38.023
Whoa. no! That not necessary!

443
00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:40.746
-Oh. God. dear no. Don't do it.
-Why is there always a gun?

444
00:22:40.942 --> 00:22:42.611
♪ Nah-nah-nah-nah ♪

445
00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.945

449
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.588
That's alright.

450
00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:04.674
I mean this as
respectfully as possible.

451
00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:06.760
but what the hell is happening?!

452
00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:07.969
It's our theme song.

453
00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.971
Your... your theme
song for killing us?

454
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.267
No. no. no. No. it's...
it's for our podcast.

455
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:17.479
It's called. "'Ey.
I'm Talkin' Here!"

456
00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.523
It's just us talking about
historical mob stories.

457
00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:22.234
Yeah. yeah. Check
it out. fresh merch.

458
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:23.944
It's a Bluetooth speaker!

459
00:23:24.027 --> 00:23:25.867
Wait. did... did you
think that was a real gun?

460
00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:28.532
Oh. my God. May... Wait.
maybe Nonna was wrong.

461
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:29.867
Maybe we are intimidating enough

462
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.118
-to be real mobsters.
-Oh!

463
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.620
Bang. bang. bang.
bang. bang. bang!

464
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.207
Is that a finger?

465
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.087
No. no. no. Please. please.
please. please don't hurt us.

466
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.256
We just thought you were here
to do a collab on our podcast

467
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:45.883
because. well. you're
friends with our mom.

468
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:48.510
I... I'm sorry. Your mom?

469
00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:50.929
Boys. the kid at Stop and Shop

470
00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:53.432
said they don't even
make 3D Doritos anymore.

471
00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:55.809
-Ma?
-Why is it so fucking dark in here?

472
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.401
I see you've met my sons.

473
00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:12.868
Keep your fingers
outta my gravy.

474
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:24.004
So. you deny my
request to find Nicky.

475
00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:27.090
and then show up at my home and
accuse me of sending you a finger?

476
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:29.759
Fine. so you didn't
send us the finger.

477
00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:32.804
Then. can you explain what
you meant when you said

478
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:36.641
that your missing husband has
everything to do with our building?

479
00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:38.894
'Cause our doorman is dead now.

480
00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.855
and Nicky wasn't missing
at all that night.

481
00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:44.900
He was at the Arconia.
We have proof.

482
00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.568
Oh. yeah.

483
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.237
Okay. now...

484
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.864
Okay. there.

485
00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:52.115
Look at that.

486
00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:56.077
Oh. I should have
known. That bastard.

487
00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.329
-Who's that? Who's that?
-Who's that?

488
00:24:57.412 --> 00:24:59.581
Oh. it's Dad.

489
00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:00.957
Okay. okay. boys.

490
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:03.126
-Come on. come on. get outta here!
-Oh!

491
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.462
-The adults need some space. Let's go.
-Hell yeah.

492
00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:07.172
-Guys. she's gonna throw it again.
-Go long.

493
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.884
Braden. that's my ball!

494
00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:14.971
So. clearly. you've heard
about my family's ties

495
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:17.098
to criminal activity.

496
00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:20.018
But the truth is.
the mob is dead.

497
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:23.480
Okay. so you say
the mob is dead.

498
00:25:23.563 --> 00:25:25.232
Why should we believe you?

499
00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:28.610
Well. for one. if the
mob was still alive.

500
00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:33.198
then why are my adult sons podcasting
about mob activity in the '70s?

501
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:36.201
Because that was the last time
there was anything to talk about.

502
00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:39.037
I mean. Scorsese is
now making movies

503
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.499
about Native Americans.
and Irish people.

504
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.668
I mean. look at this place.

505
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:47.128
My husband spent
our life savings

506
00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:50.215
moving us into the
goddamn Godfather house.

507
00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:52.509
and it doesn't
even have the den.

508
00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:54.719
-Really?
-This still doesn't explain

509
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:56.846
what Nicky was
doing with Lester.

510
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.684
We own Clean-Ups. the dry
cleaner in the Arconia.

511
00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:05.397
Clearly. Nicky couldn't be bothered
to tell his family he's alive.

512
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.526
but he can still find the time to drop
off receipts with your front desk.

513
00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:12.821
Receipts? When you came to
us. it seemed so urgent.

514
00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:16.491
Look. Nicky has a history
of "disappearing."

515
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.077
Drugs. gambling.
countless women.

516
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.454
But when he went missing.

517
00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:24.082
I was hoping that maybe
you would find him

518
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:28.795
before the world discovered that
he's just a failed mobster...

519
00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:31.381
with a fetish for gardenias.

520
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:34.301
Is there any chance that this
is your husband's finger?

521
00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:38.263
-Do you have a few more?
-Uh. just the one.

522
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:40.599
Kinda hard to tell
without the full set.

523
00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:42.434
Well. maybe this would help.

524
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:45.186
"Hey. honey.
pass-a the Prego!"

525
00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:47.439
That is incredibly offensive.

526
00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:50.400
-Mi scusi.
-No. it isn't his.

527
00:26:50.483 --> 00:26:52.527
My husband had very hairy hands.

528
00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:55.280
He once had them permed.

529
00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:58.617
Great. now I'm getting
emotional. You should go.

530
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.786
-Oh. um...
-S-Sorry.

531
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.456
-Thank you.
-Put that in the cup.

532
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.585
That was awkward.

533
00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:12.047
Yes. well. awkward is typically
my experience in Staten Island.

534
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.427
Wait! Uh. Mr. Savage!

535
00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:21.264
-Thank you.
-Mr. Savage...

536
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:25.352
you must think I'm crazy.
wanting to find a man

537
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:27.145
who clearly doesn't
want to come home.

538
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:30.815
You just don't seem like someone
who'd settle for a womanizer.

539
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:33.109
You seem like
someone who knows...

540
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.654
what up.

541
00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:40.575
Have you ever seen
him stand like that?

542
00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:43.453
I think he calls that
the Savage Swagger.

543
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:44.537
Charles...

544
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:47.666
My marriage is over.

545
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.877
and my family business
is hanging by a thread.

546
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.797
I'm... I'm worried we
might lose the house.

547
00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:55.799
I'll see what I can do.

548
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:59.010
But if it turns out he killed
Lester. all bets are off.

549
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.720
Deal.

550
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:02.555
Oh. I... that reminds me.

551
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.518
Nicky used to carry these decks
around everywhere he went.

552
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:10.355
but. uh. the night he went missing.
he left it on my nightstand.

553
00:28:10.438 --> 00:28:13.024
I mean. I... I don't know.
Maybe it's something.

554
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.735
I have a facility with cards.

555
00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.195
Oh.

556
00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.114
Among other things.

557
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:32.127
Thank you.

558
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.587
I've gotta stop doing that.

559
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:36.840
I don't live in
this tower anymore.

560
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:46.850
Oh. I gotta call Loretta. I'm
not used to the time change yet.

561
00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:48.560
It's a million
o'clock over there.

562
00:28:48.643 --> 00:28:50.228
How's she liking New Zealand?

563
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:51.980
Oh. she loves it. yeah.

564
00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:55.066
Did you know that the toilets
flush in the other way?

565
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.151
Ah.

566
00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:57.736
It's funny what gets her going.

567
00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:58.820
Yeah.

568
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:04.951
-You okay?
-Oh. oh yeah.

569
00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:08.163
No. it's just that. you
know. you're married now.

570
00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.956
and it's the start of
a whole new chapter.

571
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:13.334
and Mabel. she's got a
million new chapters.

572
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:17.338
I'm just not sure
what's next for me.

573
00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:20.133
Mini existential crisis?

574
00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:21.968
Oh. no. no. no.

575
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:26.222
But. you know. when you have
a Reuben at Katz's Deli.

576
00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:29.684
and you don't get the heartburn.
but you know it's coming?

577
00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:37.358
This is what I
want to say to you.

578
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.319
Do you know what
solves everything?

579
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.989
Pepcid. chased with two Tums.

580
00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:47.160
I'll see you in the morning.

581
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.828
Ooh.

582
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:52.540
Mrs. Durkin-Putnam.
as I live and breathe.

583
00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.042
Yes. no. you did.

584
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.835
Uh. you did tell me
about the toilet.

585
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.572
Is that a map?

586
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:19.544
Howard?

587
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.131
This doesn't prove anything.

588
00:31:25.842 --> 00:31:28.344
Where's the footage
from the courtyard?

589
00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:33.182
What is he doing?

590
00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:37.437
What the hell?

591
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:47.739
Hmm.

592
00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:50.366
You know I cared about you. pal.

593
00:31:53.036 --> 00:31:55.204
But it wouldn't hurt if
the building knew. too.

594
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.118
Oh. God. Are you
having an episode?

595
00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.787
My grandma gets
these all the time.

596
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.414
There's a map on the back
of one of Nicky's cards!

597
00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:40.083
You can only see it if
you look through red.

598
00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:41.626
It's an old spy trick. look.

599
00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:44.545
My God. Whoa.

600
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.339
-Come on.
-Wait. we...

601
00:32:50.551 --> 00:32:52.679
This is crazy.

602
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:54.931
Wait. it's leading us
through all the blind spots

603
00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:56.641
from the security footage.

604
00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:59.060
I've been mapping them
out. Okay. where to next?

605
00:33:01.604 --> 00:33:04.273
Um... I drank the map.

606
00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.653
Wait.

607
00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:10.697
I have an idea.

608
00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:17.954
How 'bout now?

609
00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.457
-Let's go.
-Yes!

610
00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:33.845
Wait a second.

611
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:36.305
I know this closet.

612
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:47.275
Hey! Look.

613
00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.871
But. this is new.

614
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.171
Closed?

615
00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:13.176
Ah. come on. Hello?
This is a hat emergency!

616
00:34:19.932 --> 00:34:21.100
Hello?

617
00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:35.698
It's locked.

618
00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:48.669
Hello? Anyone here?

619
00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:52.965
I'm... I'm just
dropping off a chapeau.

620
00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.763
Ah. his uniform.

621
00:34:59.847 --> 00:35:01.349
I'm gonna rescue you.

622
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:18.866
Whoa. mama.

623
00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:35.967
This table's been through it.

624
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.471
What do you think happened here?

625
00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:43.766
When a person passes.

626
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.894
we strive to remember
them exactly as they were.

627
00:35:47.603 --> 00:35:49.939
Yet. when we think
of our own legacy.

628
00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:53.609
there's a quiet hope to be
remembered for our best.

629
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:56.779
not our mistakes. or
our flops. or worse...

630
00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:57.864
Oh.

631
00:35:57.947 --> 00:36:00.032
...the secrets we tried to bury.

632
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.827
Ooh!

633
00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.955
What do we have here?

634
00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.833
This card has numbers
on the bottom.

635
00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:12.461
Six. 24. zero. zero.

636
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:15.506
Is that a phone
number? Address? What?

637
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:18.384
Numbers.

638
00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:22.305
Oh. that's just a roulette
wheel. that's got noth...

639
00:36:22.388 --> 00:36:23.723
Wait. what?

640
00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.519
-Give me the numbers again.
-Six.

641
00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:32.315
Twenty-four.

642
00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.569
Zero. zero.

643
00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:43.743
I need white shirts.
Look at that.

644
00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.913
Oh. God. Right.

645
00:36:53.169 --> 00:36:55.671
Charles. that's the envelope

646
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:57.757
that Nicky gave
Lester at the wedding.

647
00:37:02.303 --> 00:37:03.721
Lester was here
the night he died.

648
00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.225
This was no tragic accident.

649
00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:10.436
We need to find
Nicky Caccimelio.

650
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:11.562
Ah. gotcha!

651
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.482
The parts we most
try to hide...

652
00:37:15.942 --> 00:37:18.861
well. sometimes they slip out...

653
00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:21.280
...into the light.

654
00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.705
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.
