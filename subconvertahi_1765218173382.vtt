00:00:06.504 --> 00:00:08.440
I was wondering if you by any chance...

2
00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:09.858
still had the offer?

3
00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.111
Maybe a fresh start would be good.

4
00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.029
What about taking our finger to a lab?

5
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.616
I mean. if it isn't Jay pflug's. whose is it?

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.535
There's a secret room in the
building where your husband

7
00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.036
ran an illegal poker game.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.998
I'm more interested in
what you're up to. Charles.

9
00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:26.417
You hooked up with a suspect!

10
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.961
I can't find my phone. I might
have left it in the minivan.

11
00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:30.129
Or Sofia stole it.

12
00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:32.196
Oliver. get your car.
we're gonna intercept her.

13
00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:35.175
- Wait. you just missed our turn!
- No. no. this is a shortcut.

14
00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.052
- How do you know that?
- I grew up here.

15
00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.470
What is she doing in flat bush?

16
00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:42.040
I don't know. but maybe you could
shop for apartments while we're here.

17
00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.602
All these invoices are
made out to "Tommy."

18
00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:48.981
Tommy the tongue is not
a person. it's a company.

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.150
And that company is
worth a shit-ton of money.

20
00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:53.360
<i>except that money
was withdrawn. all of it.</i>

21
00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:55.529
<i>- first thing this damn morning.</i>
- By who?

22
00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:58.907
<i>Who would want the money
that bad to kill those dudes?</i>

23
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:00.016
Hide!

24
00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:04.854
Their wives.

<i>What makes a home?</i>

27
00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:41.033
<i>Is it just four walls sheltering

28
00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:54.088

34
00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.431

<i>Who are you without your home?</i>

36
00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:38.322
<i>And what would you do if it were gone?</i>

37
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.870
It's all gone.

38
00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:10.706
Everything. everything.

39
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.457
- Everything.
- I know. baby.

40
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:14.734
I know. my love.

41
00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:20.698
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

42
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:14.728
No. I was on set when the call came in.

43
00:04:14.752 --> 00:04:16.545
That's why I went straight to the airport.

44
00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:20.883
They said it was a short
in my electric tea kettle.

45
00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:26.514
- You know...
- Look. look. I...

46
00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:30.869
I want you to know one
thing. Not everything is gone.

47
00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:33.580
I know. I have you. you have me.

48
00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:35.856
That's really... that's all that matters. I...

49
00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:38.085
- Yeah.
- Wow. you really sold that.

50
00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:41.213
No. but it's my dad's dog
tags from Omaha beach.

51
00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:44.299
You know? And then I only
had a few little pictures of dicky...

52
00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:46.218
of the baby before I had to give him up.

53
00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:48.845
and all my playbills. and...

54
00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:51.974
just. you know. all my stuff. It's my stuff.

55
00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:53.225
Okay. come here.

56
00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:54.417
Over here.

57
00:04:55.418 --> 00:04:58.188
So now. you have new stuff!

58
00:04:58.212 --> 00:05:00.983
Our stuff. our wedding haul.

59
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:02.150
My god.

60
00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:04.611
It's just not. you know. the stuff.

61
00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:08.782
it's just 47 years I was in that apartment.

62
00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:11.600
I just feel like part of me is gone.

63
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.789
Well. now. part of you now
looks like a cabbage tureen.

64
00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:22.254
Oliver. <i>only murders in
the building.</i> season five:

65
00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:24.047
<i>- Widows' peak.</i>
- How good is that?

66
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.258
Because the widows
have <i>piqued </i>our suspicion.

67
00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:27.718
Different spelling. but we think it plays.

68
00:05:27.742 --> 00:05:28.802
Yeah.

69
00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:30.512
Hi.

70
00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:32.889
Loretta. I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:35.183
You're a sweetie.

72
00:05:35.207 --> 00:05:38.103
But you know. I didn't fly all
this way for doom and gloom.

73
00:05:38.127 --> 00:05:40.772
Let's talk murder. Hi.

74
00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:44.943
Sofia caccimelio.

75
00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:49.031
seen handing a plaid
bag to Lester's widow

76
00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:52.159
after a mysterious bank account...

77
00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:54.328
How do I make accounting sexy?

78
00:05:54.352 --> 00:05:55.412
- Can I?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:01.793
Two scorned women. black
widows. slain husbands.

80
00:06:01.817 --> 00:06:02.818
Ooh.

81
00:06:03.903 --> 00:06:05.464
Swiss accounts.

82
00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:07.174
Who said anything
about Swiss accounts?

83
00:06:07.198 --> 00:06:09.676
Yeah. you want sexy?
She's serving sexy.

84
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.512
Okay. we now have two new suspects

85
00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:14.890
that we can actually podcast about.

86
00:06:14.914 --> 00:06:17.684
Although. Charles made out with Sofia.

87
00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:19.561
who made off with his phone.

88
00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:22.064
She returned the phone.

89
00:06:22.088 --> 00:06:24.024
She didn't call up. so she
doesn't wanna see me again.

90
00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:25.108
Thank goodness!

91
00:06:25.132 --> 00:06:26.943
She's a murderous mob wife.

92
00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:30.113
We hit it. we quit it. we over.

93
00:06:30.137 --> 00:06:33.700
I've had the entrée. and
now I'm back to the apps.

94
00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:35.243
the dating apps.

95
00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:38.872
I was all over the apps
before I met you. Ollie.

96
00:06:38.896 --> 00:06:41.500
Well. I... I also dabbled. you know.

97
00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:43.710
Last gasp. Yeah.

98
00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:46.046
Old-gasm.

99
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.006
Silver shrivel.

100
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.094
Help... I've fallen in
love... and I can't get it up.

101
00:06:56.831 --> 00:06:58.892
Hey. guys?

102
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:01.686
Hey. guys. let's focus on rainey.

103
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.605
- Yeah. Okay. sorry.
- Because where was she

104
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:05.440
the night of the murders?

105
00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:08.568
And what did Sofia
give her in the plaid bag?

106
00:07:08.592 --> 00:07:11.405
You know. Oliver. since
you're from Brooklyn...

107
00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:13.824
sure. send the brooklynite to Brooklyn.

108
00:07:13.848 --> 00:07:16.201
I thought you young
people were against profiling.

109
00:07:16.225 --> 00:07:18.370
Anyway. rainey hates me.

110
00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:20.789
But she doesn't know me.

111
00:07:20.813 --> 00:07:23.500
Or Emily lawler.

112
00:07:23.524 --> 00:07:27.129
Emily lawler. the... the
detective I played on <i>svu</i>.

113
00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:30.799
- Yes. yes. yes. yes. Right.
- Yeah. it was a small part. but I mean...

114
00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:34.052
She had a great chunky cajun drawl.

115
00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:36.012
you know. and she
had a great backstory.

116
00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:39.474
She... she fell down a well as a child.

117
00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:42.644
Her backstory was
that she was in a well?

118
00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:45.689
She fell down a well as a child.

119
00:07:45.713 --> 00:07:49.025
She was down a well three
days. just her and the 'gator.

120
00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:50.861
I had a whole monologue about it.

121
00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:52.863
It was gonna be my breakout. I thought.

122
00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:56.032
But then. they cut it. and they
just pulled the whole episode.

123
00:07:56.056 --> 00:07:57.451
and you know. who knows why.

124
00:07:57.475 --> 00:07:59.536
Is it too long? Maybe.

125
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.996
But what is long?

126
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.833
- I mean. if you...
- I think this may be too long.

127
00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:07.335
Okay. but I just wanted
to be Emily lawler.

128
00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:10.255
because I've had a... a really bad day.

129
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:12.007
and I don't wanna be me.

130
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:14.092
- I don't...
- Babe. Baby. baby. baby.

131
00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:15.886
Let's... let's go to Brooklyn.

132
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.804
You show me your hometown. 'Kay?

133
00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.639
- Okay. okay.
- Okay.

134
00:08:19.663 --> 00:08:22.183
And do you still have the trench
coat from <i>death rattle dazzle?</i>

135
00:08:23.834 --> 00:08:25.937
Buck naked without her trench coat.

136
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:28.064
I love that we can share clothes.

137
00:08:28.088 --> 00:08:30.108
We can share.

138
00:08:30.132 --> 00:08:31.943
Quirky.

139
00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:39.618
- I'm here for a finger.
- Charles!

140
00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:40.827
Finally!

141
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.746
I hate having a body part in my freezer.

142
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.540
I wake up for a midnight snack
and it's haagen-dazs. finger.

143
00:08:45.564 --> 00:08:46.833
haagen-dazs. finger.

144
00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:49.002
- Damn.
- I know.

145
00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:51.963
Without the hand. it looks kinda lonely.

146
00:08:51.987 --> 00:08:54.508
No. I mean "damn." as in. this is just ice.

147
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.454
- What?
- Someone fingered your finger.

148
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:13.026
Well. there's no signs of forced entry.

149
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.528
How's it look in there?

150
00:09:14.552 --> 00:09:16.929
Anything outta place? Anything missing?

151
00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:20.474
Everything seems the same.

152
00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:26.706
Shit. y'all got the big. nice ice cubes.

153
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.084
I love the big. nice ice
cubes. make you feel rich.

154
00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:31.545
Well. it's the little things. I guess.

155
00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:33.672
Wait a minute. What's that?

156
00:09:33.696 --> 00:09:36.633
Maybe the finger thief left it?

157
00:09:36.657 --> 00:09:37.926
Wait. no.

158
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.803
I might have. I'm trying something new.

159
00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:42.681
Boots with rubber soles. very cool.

160
00:09:42.705 --> 00:09:44.849
Housekeeper must've
overlooked this. I'll take a photo.

161
00:09:44.873 --> 00:09:46.726
She appreciates. visual feedback.

162
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.520
Don't we all?

163
00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:52.315
Charles. when was the last
time you laid eyes on the finger?

164
00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:53.817
When we put it in the freezer.

165
00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:57.153
Great. so it could have been
stolen anytime in the last week.

166
00:10:00.264 --> 00:10:01.825
Last gasp notification.

167
00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:03.868
- I'm talking to someone very nice.
- Yeah?

168
00:10:03.892 --> 00:10:05.787
And what's her kinks?

169
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:08.206
Murdering? Dealing?
Hitting and running?

170
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.083
You know what? I deserve that.

171
00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:12.961
But that's why I'm trying online dating
to meet someone good for a change.

172
00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:14.528
And have you?

173
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:18.633
Okay. you're being cute.

174
00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:19.950
Let me see a pic.

175
00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:21.952
Yep.

176
00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:23.888
That's just a chin.

177
00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:25.098
Yeah. it's a chin.

178
00:10:25.122 --> 00:10:26.349
Come on.

179
00:10:26.373 --> 00:10:29.644
We're doing a little game where we
exchange body part photos very slowly.

180
00:10:29.668 --> 00:10:31.187
and I kinda roll it out. you know?

181
00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:33.231
Holy!

182
00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:34.506
Wow!

183
00:10:35.215 --> 00:10:36.276
No.

184
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.926
No. you're not wearing an earring.

185
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:40.614
- Yes.
- No. you're not.

186
00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:41.398
Priscilla likes it. Yeah.

187
00:10:41.422 --> 00:10:42.699
I... I don't care what she says. you're...

188
00:10:42.723 --> 00:10:44.909
- okay. I'm taking it off. there you...
- okay. guys. Stop.

189
00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:47.770
How can I get access to
security cameras in the building?

190
00:10:48.729 --> 00:10:50.540
Howard's robot bff.

191
00:10:50.564 --> 00:10:52.149
- They're in the lobby.
- There we go.

192
00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:56.963
- Okay. let's test my...
- Okay.

193
00:10:56.987 --> 00:10:59.174
- Oliver lore.
- Yes.

194
00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:00.675
- Flatbush.
- Yes.

195
00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:03.637
- You lived here from nine to 12...
- Yeah.

196
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:05.513
with your second set of foster parents...

197
00:11:05.537 --> 00:11:06.681
- Right.
- Sue and al.

198
00:11:06.705 --> 00:11:09.976
Sue had the six cats. Al
had the. drinking problem.

199
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.312
No. no. no. no. no. she had eight cats.

200
00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.022
And he called it a "drinking opportunity."

201
00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:17.067
What I'd give to see you

202
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:20.195
- playing stick ball in a purple scarf...
- Yeah.

203
00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:21.988
With those little preteen gams...

204
00:11:22.012 --> 00:11:24.240
just sliding right into home.

205
00:11:28.352 --> 00:11:29.704
<i>Can I play?</i>

206
00:11:29.728 --> 00:11:30.789
Ollie?

207
00:11:30.813 --> 00:11:32.123
- Ice cream!
- Hurry up!

208
00:11:32.147 --> 00:11:33.333
- Not it!
- Not it!

209
00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:49.391
I'd say I miss those gams.
but who are we kidding?

210
00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:51.351
- I still got 'em.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:53.728
It's true.

212
00:11:59.174 --> 00:12:01.403
Ooh. okay.

213
00:12:01.427 --> 00:12:04.948
Rainey kills her husband and
instantly puts her place up for sale.

214
00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:06.783
That plaid bag is in there.

215
00:12:06.807 --> 00:12:09.619
I feel it. I feel it.

216
00:12:09.643 --> 00:12:12.146
And Emily lawler's
instincts are never wrong.

217
00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:24.384
So embarrassing. caught
listening to your own song. right?

218
00:12:24.408 --> 00:12:26.261
Yeah. it's so cool.

219
00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:27.345
Let me just...

220
00:12:35.127 --> 00:12:36.730
Girl. this is you? This is a bop!

221
00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:38.523
Thank you! I know. right?

222
00:12:38.547 --> 00:12:40.859
But I just can't figure
out how to turn it off.

223
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:50.201
Okay. There we go.

224
00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:51.268
Yeah. it's still on.

225
00:12:52.478 --> 00:12:53.580
Wait.

226
00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:55.665
Are you... are you guys on a case?

227
00:12:55.689 --> 00:12:56.958
- Yeah. there was a break-in...
- no. No!

228
00:12:56.982 --> 00:12:58.960
I mean. no. there's nothing. No.

229
00:12:58.984 --> 00:13:00.110
A break-in?

230
00:13:00.569 --> 00:13:02.964
Wait. you're on the 14th floor. right?

231
00:13:02.988 --> 00:13:04.048
I wonder.

232
00:13:04.072 --> 00:13:05.884
Okay. so last night. gaga calls me.

233
00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:08.136
And then after. I run into Seth... Rogen...

234
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.847
and we end up back at my
penthouse doing shrooms.

235
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:12.974
And we're looking out the
window and we're just. like.

236
00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:14.976
tripping on this little light

237
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.022
that keeps moving around
the 14th floor on the east tower.

238
00:13:19.046 --> 00:13:20.815
You think there was
someone in my apartment?

239
00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:22.442
Or she was just hallucinating.

240
00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:23.860
That is what Seth Rogen said.

241
00:13:23.884 --> 00:13:26.154
- You could just call him Seth.
- No. I think it might be confusing.

242
00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:28.364
'cause I'm also really good
friends with Seth meyers.

243
00:13:28.388 --> 00:13:29.783
So. anyway.

244
00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:32.202
Seth Rogen and I. we end
up going to an apartment.

245
00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:34.579
and sure enough. there is a little light

246
00:13:34.603 --> 00:13:36.289
moving under the door.

247
00:13:36.313 --> 00:13:38.473
Wait. hold up. do you remember
what the apartment was?

248
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.252
And I thought that the c.

249
00:13:41.276 --> 00:13:44.005
it looked like a little
person wanting a hug.

250
00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:46.949
But no one was hugging it back.

251
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.973
My god. my god.

252
00:13:53.997 --> 00:13:55.677
I love you so much.
Can we take a picture?

253
00:13:56.542 --> 00:13:58.394
Mora?

254
00:13:58.418 --> 00:14:01.105
I'm gonna need you to talk to
her to get some more information.

255
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:03.441
- Wh...
- Yeah. I clocked it.

256
00:14:03.465 --> 00:14:05.944
Middle school besties.
did everything together.

257
00:14:05.968 --> 00:14:08.571
until you had some
nuclear-level friendship blow-up.

258
00:14:08.595 --> 00:14:10.990
Wow. You are a great detective.

259
00:14:11.014 --> 00:14:13.451
No. I was just a teenage girl.

260
00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:15.411
But then I got titties. and so did you.

261
00:14:15.435 --> 00:14:18.438
So. we grow up. we get over
it. and we move on. yeah?

262
00:14:24.403 --> 00:14:26.363
- Hi.
- Hello there.

263
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:29.551
Feel free. the flyers are
there for your perusal.

264
00:14:29.575 --> 00:14:32.136
Why. thank you very much.

265
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.806
Okay. Nice hat.

266
00:14:36.415 --> 00:14:38.142
- Hello.
- Hello. welcome.

267
00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:39.477
- Thanks.
- Have a look.

268
00:14:39.501 --> 00:14:43.106
This is the exact layout
as the place I grew up in.

269
00:14:44.882 --> 00:14:48.111
Good. you... you kept the original floors.

270
00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:50.530
And the tuberculosis.

271
00:15:25.213 --> 00:15:26.798
This room is off limits.

272
00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:33.406
I'm so. so. so sorry
to scream out like that.

273
00:15:35.557 --> 00:15:39.454
It's. PTSD from the well.

274
00:15:39.478 --> 00:15:42.332
but I... I won't... I won't
bore you with the whole story.

275
00:15:42.356 --> 00:15:46.169
Name's Emily lawler. just up
here by way of natchitoches.

276
00:15:46.193 --> 00:15:48.713
Big change for a little swamp girl like me.

277
00:15:48.737 --> 00:15:53.051
I was headin' on. up the
stairs and I heard <i>"vissi d'arte."</i>

278
00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:54.636
You know <i>tosca?</i>

279
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.036
Do I!

280
00:15:57.037 --> 00:16:01.267
I played the Maria callas part
in my senior year at Lafayette.

281
00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:05.146
Is that floria tosca's... dagger?

282
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.523
This is the same one Maria callas used

283
00:16:07.547 --> 00:16:10.801
in her final performance
of <i>tosca </i>at the met.

284
00:16:12.302 --> 00:16:14.697
Isn't it wonderful?

285
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:18.868
My husband came across
it at a police repo auction.

286
00:16:18.892 --> 00:16:21.037
On our 10th anniversary.

287
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:22.729
It was perfect!

288
00:16:24.064 --> 00:16:26.084
He died this month.

289
00:16:28.026 --> 00:16:29.295
My condolences.

290
00:16:29.319 --> 00:16:31.697
I lost mine this past year.

291
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.134
In a fire. I lost everything.

292
00:16:35.158 --> 00:16:38.846
So... Is this your lucky fella?

293
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.433
No. no. no. I was his lucky gal.

294
00:16:42.457 --> 00:16:45.728
And we were married for
30 years. and every night

295
00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:47.897
he would come home
and kiss me on the head.

296
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:50.215
And then one night. no kiss and...

297
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:53.969
He was gone.

298
00:16:55.012 --> 00:16:56.948
Yeah. he fell into the fountain

299
00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:59.492
of the courtyard where we married.

300
00:17:02.394 --> 00:17:04.330
Look at that woodwork!

301
00:17:04.354 --> 00:17:05.957
You don't see moldings like that no more.

302
00:17:05.981 --> 00:17:08.209
- My god.
- Yeah. 100% pine.

303
00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:09.460
- Are you serious?
- On my mother...

304
00:17:09.484 --> 00:17:11.421
I would not lie to you. my friend.

305
00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:17.301
Listen. not for nothing.
what's your credit score?

306
00:17:18.744 --> 00:17:20.138
Excuse me one sec.

307
00:17:20.162 --> 00:17:22.473
I'll be right back.

308
00:17:22.497 --> 00:17:24.499
- Pardon me.
- Jesus Christ.

309
00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:34.051
There are the bags. Look at them.

310
00:17:34.968 --> 00:17:37.864
<i>Al. sue. come on!</i>

311
00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:42.785
<i>I'm asking you. please. The
play's not a waste of time.</i>

312
00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:45.288
- I think you'll like it.
- Look enough of this.

313
00:17:45.312 --> 00:17:48.207
We're not going to any
play. and neither are you.

314
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:50.293
We took him in. If he's got any free time.

315
00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:52.253
he can work at the goddamn store.

316
00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:54.922
Don't be difficult now.

317
00:17:54.946 --> 00:17:58.033
And it'll feel good for you
to contribute to this house.

318
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.511
- Aw.
- Al!

319
00:18:00.535 --> 00:18:02.513
Not fair.

320
00:18:08.001 --> 00:18:10.605
If I may.

321
00:18:10.629 --> 00:18:12.065
Why are you sellin'?

322
00:18:12.089 --> 00:18:14.817
I would give anything
to at least have my home

323
00:18:14.841 --> 00:18:16.694
and my... my stuff back.

324
00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:19.012
Yeah. I thought I'd
feel the same way. but...

325
00:18:20.097 --> 00:18:23.350
You know. I look
around. and honestly. I...

326
00:18:24.726 --> 00:18:26.829
I don't want any of this.

327
00:18:26.853 --> 00:18:28.105
I want him.

328
00:18:32.442 --> 00:18:33.443
Yeah.

329
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:37.215
And. anyway. it's not like
I can afford to stay here.

330
00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:39.008
I'm even selling the dagger.

331
00:18:39.032 --> 00:18:42.678
My son thinks I can get
$500 for this on eBay.

332
00:18:42.702 --> 00:18:44.347
Yeah.

333
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:46.123
You wouldn't want this. would you?

334
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:52.730
So. you didn't find the bag.
but you gave our suspect $500

335
00:18:52.754 --> 00:18:54.690
to keep a weapon?

336
00:18:54.714 --> 00:18:56.818
You didn't find a bag either.

337
00:18:56.842 --> 00:18:59.237
Side note. how much cash do you carry?

338
00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:01.531
You know I don't trust banks.

339
00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:03.515
And I do?!

340
00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:10.665
I don't care about my stuff.

341
00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:14.127
I'm so glad you're in my life.

342
00:19:18.864 --> 00:19:23.136
And that woman... That
woman didn't kill her husband.

343
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.930
She's barely hanging on.

344
00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:28.141
Loretta. look.

345
00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:30.250
The daily meeting of
the innocent wives club.

346
00:19:31.877 --> 00:19:33.479
And that's the mobster's wife.

347
00:19:33.503 --> 00:19:36.381
And that is a plaid bag
full of money. I'm guessing.

348
00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:40.760
She played me. She
played me like a fuckin' fiddle.

349
00:19:42.262 --> 00:19:44.073
We're in pursuit. Putnam!

350
00:19:44.097 --> 00:19:45.223
Yeah. okay.

351
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.372
Howard. we need robot Lester's help.

352
00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:53.082
He prefers "lestr."

353
00:19:53.106 --> 00:19:55.209
You can use "human
Lester" for the dead one.

354
00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:59.755
Speaking of. I've styled new lestr up
a bit more dashingly than the last one.

355
00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:01.924
So. what do you need?
Lestr can do anything.

356
00:20:01.948 --> 00:20:04.093
Except cleanup spills.
We're still shy around water.

357
00:20:04.117 --> 00:20:05.928
<i>I got killed by water yesterday.</i>

358
00:20:05.952 --> 00:20:09.974
Howard's gonna keep you dry.

359
00:20:09.998 --> 00:20:11.642
You're safe with Howard.

360
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:14.520
- I don't feel safe at all.
- Howard. we need to see footage

361
00:20:14.544 --> 00:20:17.815
of Charles' front door
from last night around...

362
00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:19.358
What time were you creeping around?

363
00:20:19.382 --> 00:20:21.903
With Seth Rogen? Around 2:30.

364
00:20:21.927 --> 00:20:23.654
Ooh. I'm so excited. I did a clue.

365
00:20:25.013 --> 00:20:26.824
- You got that. babe?
<i>- Gotcha. daddy.</i>

366
00:20:26.848 --> 00:20:28.201
Is that grooming?

367
00:20:28.225 --> 00:20:30.828
Now. at the academy they
prepared us for a lot of stuff.

368
00:20:30.852 --> 00:20:33.956
but I ain't never seen
no shit like this. I'm shook.

369
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.500
Okay. this is 1:00 to 3:00 A.M.

370
00:20:36.524 --> 00:20:38.127
- Let me know when to stop.
- Okay.

371
00:20:38.151 --> 00:20:41.005
I was wearing my red feather
cape. couture. gifted by donatella.

372
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:42.632
- Yeah?
- She raises. plucks.

373
00:20:42.656 --> 00:20:44.675
and slaughters the birds.
humanely. of course.

374
00:20:44.699 --> 00:20:46.886
So. just look for plumes. I'll pop.

375
00:20:48.453 --> 00:20:50.598
Yeah. I don't see any feathers.

376
00:20:50.622 --> 00:20:52.683
Are you sure this is the right time?

377
00:20:52.707 --> 00:20:54.518
Lestr doesn't make mistakes.

378
00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:56.812
Well. I think he did. because I was there.

379
00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:58.648
Were you. though? I mean.

380
00:20:58.672 --> 00:21:02.610
maybe you were just telling a
story about your celebrity friend.

381
00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.570
and pretend you saw
something that you didn't see

382
00:21:04.594 --> 00:21:06.072
just because you have to make it

383
00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:07.823
- all about you.
- Mora!

384
00:21:07.847 --> 00:21:10.618
Okay. yep. right there. See. look.

385
00:21:10.642 --> 00:21:12.286
Can you go back to it
again. but just go slower?

386
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.478
Here you go.

387
00:21:17.774 --> 00:21:20.753
- Was that...
- Humane fuckin' feathers.

388
00:21:20.777 --> 00:21:23.547
Someone cut a chunk out of
the footage. They tampered with it.

389
00:21:23.571 --> 00:21:25.782
I'll bet that's when they took the finger.

390
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.222
Which means... Althea
was telling the truth.

391
00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:32.765
Yep.

392
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:34.725
Well. Charles and I are
gonna go to the precinct.

393
00:21:34.749 --> 00:21:36.686
because if the cops
have any footage of Lester

394
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.980
falling into the fountain. I wanna see it.

395
00:21:39.004 --> 00:21:40.231
What about me?

396
00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:42.549
You need to go and apologize to that girl.

397
00:21:46.553 --> 00:21:49.490
Should we try to get closer?

398
00:21:49.514 --> 00:21:51.325
No. no. no. I don't want them to see us.

399
00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:54.370
Also. the bod's starting to
tighten up. Did you pack a banana?

400
00:21:54.394 --> 00:21:57.290
Hey. how's it going today?
Do you care about dogs dying?

401
00:21:57.314 --> 00:21:59.041
- Well. obviously. yes.
- My god. yes. of course.

402
00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:01.168
Well. I'm collecting signatures
to stop New York City

403
00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:03.129
from opening its first ever casino.

404
00:22:03.153 --> 00:22:05.881
Right now. there's a few competing bids.
They're all just terrible for the city.

405
00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:07.425
- So. if you could just...
- wait a minute. sorry.

406
00:22:07.449 --> 00:22:08.801
What does that have to do with dogs?

407
00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:10.845
Nothing. I just find it's a helpful way

408
00:22:10.869 --> 00:22:12.430
to get people to stop.
you know what I'm saying?

409
00:22:12.454 --> 00:22:14.390
- My god. they're gone!
- Geez.

410
00:22:14.414 --> 00:22:15.975
- Anyway...
- saboteur!

411
00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:19.145
- God. where'd they go?
- We lost them.

412
00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:21.897
Maybe we should head on
up to the corner and split up.

413
00:22:21.921 --> 00:22:22.982
Or no.

414
00:22:23.006 --> 00:22:26.652
No. we should go back to her
house and wait for them there. okay?

415
00:22:26.676 --> 00:22:28.070
Oliver. what are you doing?

416
00:22:28.094 --> 00:22:29.947
I didn't think this would still be here.

417
00:22:29.971 --> 00:22:31.056
What?

418
00:22:34.434 --> 00:22:36.203
Just for a minute. can
I show you something?

419
00:22:36.227 --> 00:22:38.355
Okay. Ooh.

420
00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:47.322
What?

421
00:22:49.866 --> 00:22:51.802
- This is it.
- What?

422
00:22:51.826 --> 00:22:54.454
The theater that made me love theater.

423
00:22:55.413 --> 00:22:58.583
Man.

424
00:22:59.584 --> 00:23:01.979
Yeah. I can... I can see it.

425
00:23:02.003 --> 00:23:03.588
Little Ollie...

426
00:23:04.756 --> 00:23:07.109
Owning the spotlight.

427
00:23:07.133 --> 00:23:09.987
Well. it wasn't exactly like that.

428
00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:11.572
No?

429
00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:14.617
I was a... a quiet kid.

430
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:17.828
- Yeah.
- No. it's true. I was.

431
00:23:19.312 --> 00:23:22.875
Bouncing from place to
place. you learn quiet is good.

432
00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:26.027
If you make yourself small...

433
00:23:27.987 --> 00:23:30.424
Maybe a family will
let you stay for a while.

434
00:23:30.448 --> 00:23:32.492
So. I did. and it worked.

435
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.453
But I never...

436
00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:37.956
Felt at home.

437
00:23:40.125 --> 00:23:44.188
Until one day... I stumbled into here.

438
00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:46.982
There were kids putting on a show...

439
00:23:48.133 --> 00:23:51.987
and they were big. and
loud. and unapologetic.

440
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:55.366
- And I... I wanted to be just like them.
- Yeah.

441
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.826
They asked me to be in their play.

442
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.538
Bit part. but being on
that stage was the feeling

443
00:24:00.562 --> 00:24:03.666
that I'd been searching for my whole life.

444
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.628
I rehearsed my little butt
off. hemmed my costume.

445
00:24:07.652 --> 00:24:11.406
But when I worked up the
courage to invite sue and al...

446
00:24:12.782 --> 00:24:14.868
They just...

447
00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:19.414
I quit the play.

448
00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:28.941
But on the night of the
show. I couldn't stay away.

449
00:24:28.965 --> 00:24:32.611
I snuck out... dressed in that costume.

450
00:24:32.635 --> 00:24:34.929
just in case they still needed me.

451
00:24:35.555 --> 00:24:39.285
And I watched pat Rafferty say my line.

452
00:24:48.985 --> 00:24:53.615
I've only really felt like
myself in two places.

453
00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:58.304
I think... I think being back here today.

454
00:24:58.328 --> 00:25:03.350
I... I've... I finally
understand why I'm so afraid

455
00:25:03.374 --> 00:25:05.084
to leave the arconia.

456
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.814
I got an offer on my place.

457
00:25:08.838 --> 00:25:10.006
It's big.

458
00:25:11.508 --> 00:25:12.550
How big?

459
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.529
Late-career Brando big.

460
00:25:15.553 --> 00:25:17.656
- Boy.
- Yeah.

461
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.910
A cushion. Would be nice.

462
00:25:20.934 --> 00:25:21.935
Yeah.

463
00:25:23.603 --> 00:25:25.748
What am I saying?

464
00:25:25.772 --> 00:25:28.149
But then again... you know. you...

465
00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:31.253
What are we doing?

466
00:25:31.277 --> 00:25:32.487
I just...

467
00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:43.557
I want you to say your line.

468
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:46.101
- My what?
- Ollie.

469
00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:48.562
You took this awful life you were given

470
00:25:48.586 --> 00:25:51.023
and you turned it into
something beautiful.

471
00:25:51.047 --> 00:25:56.362
I refuse to let you think there's any
place on earth you can't be happy.

472
00:25:56.386 --> 00:25:58.197
starting right here.

473
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:00.199
- Okay?
- Alright.

474
00:26:00.223 --> 00:26:02.350
Okay.

475
00:26:03.268 --> 00:26:06.622
But only if you do

476
00:26:06.646 --> 00:26:09.625
the never-performed
Emily lawler monologue first.

477
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:12.253
- No. I'm not gonna... no.
- Yes. yes. yes.

478
00:26:12.277 --> 00:26:13.963
Get up. come on.

479
00:26:13.987 --> 00:26:15.506
- I wanna see it.
- I... I can't possibly.

480
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.715
I haven't even...

481
00:26:16.739 --> 00:26:18.175
Man. I haven't thought
about that in year...

482
00:26:18.199 --> 00:26:19.969
Mr. Thibideaux.

483
00:26:19.993 --> 00:26:22.763
You must think that I'm
some damsel in distress.

484
00:26:22.787 --> 00:26:25.641
Or maybe you think
that I'm still that little girl.

485
00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:30.378
stuck down in Bob turley's
borehole. beggin' for help.

486
00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:37.736
But I'm not that little girl
anymore. Mr. Thibideaux.

487
00:26:39.596 --> 00:26:44.827
One night. you gon' be lying in your bed.

488
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:48.998
warm and safe. and I'm gon' find you.

489
00:26:49.022 --> 00:26:52.585
And with pa's gun delivered
straight down from heaven above.

490
00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:56.279
I will put you in my
sights just like that 'gator.

491
00:26:58.906 --> 00:27:02.493
I can't wait to lower that gun...

492
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.288
And tell you...

493
00:27:06.998 --> 00:27:07.999
No.

494
00:27:11.085 --> 00:27:13.004
Y'all ain't even worth killin'.

495
00:27:18.509 --> 00:27:20.178
Bravo!

496
00:27:20.303 --> 00:27:22.930
- Spectacular.
- Now. you!

497
00:27:24.432 --> 00:27:25.433
Okay.

498
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:29.646
Hey. fagin!

499
00:27:31.397 --> 00:27:34.525
These sausages are moldy!

500
00:27:38.196 --> 00:27:40.382
- That... that was the line?
- That was it.

501
00:27:40.406 --> 00:27:41.884
- Okay. That was it!
- That was it.

502
00:27:41.908 --> 00:27:43.344
That was... that's all there was.

503
00:27:55.963 --> 00:28:00.152
Well... If it ain't the crybaby con-artist.

504
00:28:00.176 --> 00:28:02.154
Thought you could fool me. bitch?

505
00:28:02.178 --> 00:28:03.572
You can drop the accent.

506
00:28:03.596 --> 00:28:05.366
Okay. drop this.

507
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.076
We know about the emptied accounts.

508
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.621
We know about the bags of cash
passed between bloodthirsty broads.

509
00:28:10.645 --> 00:28:12.122
What the hell is going on here?

510
00:28:12.146 --> 00:28:14.649
Did you follow me
after my date with ch...

511
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.170
- Where's Charles?
- Back off. Sofia! He's fragile.

512
00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:22.299
I think we were both in a fragile.

513
00:28:22.323 --> 00:28:26.512
yet slightly horny...
Don't change the subject.

514
00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:28.055
Fine.

515
00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:32.101
My husband ran a few
businesses in the arconia.

516
00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.560
and Lester worked for him.

517
00:28:33.584 --> 00:28:36.021
I was bringing rainey Lester's cut.

518
00:28:36.045 --> 00:28:38.107
- Yeah. money you killed your husbands for.
- Right.

519
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:40.484
Wait. nobody killed my husband.

520
00:28:40.508 --> 00:28:42.277
He died by accident.

521
00:28:42.301 --> 00:28:45.239
You think somebody killed my husband?

522
00:28:46.347 --> 00:28:49.284
Who the fuck killed my Lester?!

523
00:28:49.308 --> 00:28:52.371
- Y-You did.
- Wrong! Give me names!

524
00:28:52.395 --> 00:28:55.332
- I'm scared now. I can't remember.
- There was a card game.

525
00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:57.459
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- In the arconia the night of our wedding.

526
00:28:57.483 --> 00:29:00.421
No. but he said he wouldn't
work for Nicky that night

527
00:29:00.445 --> 00:29:02.923
so he could go to your wedding.

528
00:29:02.947 --> 00:29:05.801
My god. why wasn't I there?

529
00:29:05.825 --> 00:29:08.637
Because I was here.
We... we had rehearsal.

530
00:29:08.661 --> 00:29:10.973
Well. can anyone corroborate that?

531
00:29:10.997 --> 00:29:13.392
Yeah. 23 tone-deaf kids.

532
00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:14.810
They'll be here in a minute.

533
00:29:14.834 --> 00:29:17.688
You know. I... I teach musical theater.

534
00:29:17.712 --> 00:29:19.314
I teach opera.

535
00:29:19.338 --> 00:29:22.276
The money is to help keep the lights on.

536
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.986
- That's...
- So. do you have any idea

537
00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.529
who could have killed your husbands?

538
00:29:25.553 --> 00:29:26.905
Did they have any enemies?

539
00:29:26.929 --> 00:29:28.431
- No one!
- Everyone.

540
00:29:29.307 --> 00:29:33.203
Well. Lester didn't wanna tell
me much about what he did.

541
00:29:33.227 --> 00:29:34.997
He didn't feel good about the job.

542
00:29:35.021 --> 00:29:37.791
but he was hoping to save
enough for our big dream:

543
00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:39.877
A place in the arconia.

544
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:42.004
You know. it's where we met.

545
00:29:42.028 --> 00:29:44.906
It's the last thing he ever said. Look.

546
00:29:45.823 --> 00:29:47.366
- "It's beautiful."
- Yeah.

547
00:29:48.743 --> 00:29:50.220
- It's...
- He got that right.

548
00:29:50.244 --> 00:29:53.182
Okay. you're off my list

549
00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:55.392
because you made me feel things.

550
00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:57.668
You! Why are you here?

551
00:29:59.504 --> 00:30:00.647
No!

552
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:03.609
Relax! It's one of my dumb son's toys.

553
00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:06.987
Rainey's borrowing it for
her production of <i>newsies.</i>

554
00:30:08.763 --> 00:30:10.348
- Hi. kids!
- Hey!

555
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.786
<i>Newsies!</i>

556
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.813
Can I help?

557
00:30:18.606 --> 00:30:21.668
Thank you for caring about Lester.

558
00:30:21.692 --> 00:30:25.506
And if this helps. the
police found it on him.

559
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.259
It's one of his bird whistles.
I've carried it ever since.

560
00:30:29.283 --> 00:30:30.743
Thank you.

561
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:33.639
Come on.

562
00:30:33.663 --> 00:30:35.432
Who's playing cowboy Kelly?

563
00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:49.345
Althea? It's Mabel.

564
00:30:50.388 --> 00:30:51.532
Look. I came to talk...

565
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.225
what the hell?

566
00:30:56.394 --> 00:30:58.622
My name is thē!

567
00:30:58.646 --> 00:31:01.041
Jesus Christ!

568
00:31:01.065 --> 00:31:03.502
Why are you throwing shoes at me?

569
00:31:03.526 --> 00:31:05.003
Did it hurt your feelings?

570
00:31:05.027 --> 00:31:07.422
- No. but it hurt my arm!
- Good. 'cause you know what?

571
00:31:07.446 --> 00:31:10.509
I'm a famous pop star now who
lives above you at the arconia.

572
00:31:10.533 --> 00:31:12.553
So. I have about a
billion other free shoes

573
00:31:12.577 --> 00:31:14.221
with very spiky heels!

574
00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:16.473
God. what is your problem?

575
00:31:16.497 --> 00:31:18.809
Will you stop it? I'm trying to apologize.

576
00:31:18.833 --> 00:31:21.645
and you're acting like a fucking baby!

577
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.691
<i>I'm </i>the fucking baby?

578
00:31:25.715 --> 00:31:27.985
You're the one that embarrassed
me in front of my new neighbors.

579
00:31:28.009 --> 00:31:31.154
Well. you're the one that
made me afraid to be myself

580
00:31:31.178 --> 00:31:33.848
and... be silly with girls.

581
00:31:34.724 --> 00:31:35.725
Wait. what?

582
00:31:40.146 --> 00:31:41.439
Sunny and cloudy.

583
00:31:42.523 --> 00:31:44.877
That thing we used to do

584
00:31:44.901 --> 00:31:47.004
- before you changed.
- I changed?

585
00:31:47.028 --> 00:31:50.549
Yeah. you dyed your hair pink and
made everyone call you "the". or...

586
00:31:50.573 --> 00:31:52.593
You know what? Only
after you ghosted me.

587
00:31:52.617 --> 00:31:54.177
I didn't ghost you.

588
00:31:54.201 --> 00:31:56.388
My friend died. I was depressed.

589
00:31:56.412 --> 00:31:59.141
Well. nobody told me that.
so I was depressed. too.

590
00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:00.475
I had to double my Lexapro.

591
00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:02.311
I doubled <i>my </i>Lexapro.

592
00:32:02.335 --> 00:32:04.354
Honestly. thank god for Lexapro.

593
00:32:04.378 --> 00:32:05.922
Honestly. thank god.

594
00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:14.597
I don't know if you know this. but...

595
00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:18.452
I wrote this song about you.

596
00:32:18.476 --> 00:32:21.288
Yeah. the artwork kind of gives it away.

597
00:32:21.312 --> 00:32:23.832
The sun and cloud clued me in.

598
00:32:23.856 --> 00:32:26.442
But you're wrong.

599
00:32:27.276 --> 00:32:28.903
I never wished I was you.

600
00:32:30.738 --> 00:32:32.424
I know that.

601
00:32:32.448 --> 00:32:34.200
Because I wished I was you.

602
00:32:35.117 --> 00:32:36.678
Mabel.

603
00:32:36.702 --> 00:32:38.847
You ditched me for your city friends.

604
00:32:38.871 --> 00:32:43.143
And every time I came to visit
you. you made me feel so lame.

605
00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:46.229
And in my head. the arconia was. like.

606
00:32:46.253 --> 00:32:48.649
the coolest. fanciest place.

607
00:32:48.673 --> 00:32:52.277
And that is why I wanted to live here.

608
00:32:52.301 --> 00:32:54.011
You made it my dream.

609
00:32:56.889 --> 00:32:58.700
I'm... I'm sorry.

610
00:32:58.724 --> 00:33:01.852
I didn't mean to make you feel lame.

611
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.623
You're objectively not.

612
00:33:04.647 --> 00:33:07.209
I mean. you're friends with Seth Rogen.

613
00:33:07.233 --> 00:33:08.567
And Seth meyers.

614
00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:15.866
But you know. I really.
really could use an old friend.

615
00:33:17.368 --> 00:33:18.995
You think we could start over?

616
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.958
Can I keep these shoes?

617
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.312
Are you still a size eight?

618
00:33:32.633 --> 00:33:34.444
Oliver. we got the
courtyard security footage.

619
00:33:34.468 --> 00:33:36.446
This is it. Oliver. Where's your laptop?

620
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.888
In my office.

621
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.517
Young one. A word.

622
00:33:42.685 --> 00:33:44.371
Ooh. I love your boots.

623
00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:45.872
Thanks. they're althea's.

624
00:33:45.896 --> 00:33:47.708
Did you drop a house on her?

625
00:33:47.732 --> 00:33:50.651
Actually. the witches made up.

626
00:33:51.569 --> 00:33:54.280
Well. speaking of houses...

627
00:33:55.322 --> 00:33:57.843
No. Are you really leaving?

628
00:33:57.867 --> 00:34:00.202
I wanted to tell you first.

629
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.974
Okay. I'm okay.

630
00:34:03.998 --> 00:34:06.435
Are you... are you going far?

631
00:34:06.459 --> 00:34:07.894
Are you kidding?

632
00:34:07.918 --> 00:34:10.605
Who is Oliver Putnam if he's
not on the upper West Side?

633
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:13.108
Ollie. can you come help me?

634
00:34:13.132 --> 00:34:15.819
- Man.
- I gotta send my new roomie

635
00:34:15.843 --> 00:34:17.720
back to the burn unit.

636
00:34:22.725 --> 00:34:24.828
What?

637
00:34:24.852 --> 00:34:27.456
Sorry. it's just Priscilla. she's so funny.

638
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.499
Look. Charles. I'm happy for you.

639
00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:31.710
but if she starts asking for money.

640
00:34:31.734 --> 00:34:34.087
or your mother's maiden
name. or childhood pet's name...

641
00:34:34.111 --> 00:34:35.589
just let me know.

642
00:34:35.613 --> 00:34:38.091
You don't have to worry about
that. She's just interested in my day.

643
00:34:38.115 --> 00:34:40.385
When I told her about the break-in.
you should have seen her face.

644
00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:41.887
Well. actually. I didn't even see her face

645
00:34:41.911 --> 00:34:44.222
'cause the Wi-Fi in Portugal is so iffy.

646
00:34:44.246 --> 00:34:45.915
You told her about the case?

647
00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:49.644
Well. just a... a little tidbit.

648
00:34:49.668 --> 00:34:51.772
I mean. she had a thousand
questions about our plan.

649
00:34:51.796 --> 00:34:53.482
and the conversation was slowing down.

650
00:34:53.506 --> 00:34:56.485
You know what. give me your fuckin'
phone. You're being catfished. Charles.

651
00:34:56.509 --> 00:34:58.445
Okay. play the footage.

652
00:35:02.431 --> 00:35:04.076
My god.

653
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.578
Wh... s-so he was alone?

654
00:35:06.602 --> 00:35:08.371
No. look.

655
00:35:08.395 --> 00:35:10.916
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

656
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.503
Okay. so if you look right here.
this glitch is from the same footage

657
00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:16.213
as thē and Seth Rogen's.

658
00:35:16.237 --> 00:35:18.006
Somebody has fucked with this shit. too.

659
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.508
Something has been cut out.

660
00:35:19.532 --> 00:35:23.178
Why is the last gasp peach logo

661
00:35:23.202 --> 00:35:25.746
the same as on the security footage?

662
00:35:27.123 --> 00:35:28.582
It's the same company.

663
00:35:29.458 --> 00:35:32.062
So. who owns the company
that edited our footage

664
00:35:32.086 --> 00:35:34.606
and is pumping Charles
for info about our case?

665
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.150
Hold on. I'm lookin'.

666
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.030
What?

667
00:35:42.054 --> 00:35:44.074
So. do we look for another two bedroom

668
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:46.118
so we can still use all my furniture?

669
00:35:46.142 --> 00:35:48.787
We could. we could.
Or we could start over.

670
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:52.290
I could do a pinterest board.
which is kind of like a murder board.

671
00:35:52.314 --> 00:35:55.335
but for finding our style as a couple.

672
00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:57.170
Alright. that would be great.

673
00:35:58.487 --> 00:36:00.507
<i>It takes bravery to build a new home.</i>

674
00:36:00.531 --> 00:36:03.260
<i>and it's easier to be brave
when you're in the arms</i>

675
00:36:03.284 --> 00:36:06.638
<i>of someone who makes you feel safe.</i>

676
00:36:06.662 --> 00:36:09.808
<i>But even for those who do build anew.</i>

677
00:36:09.832 --> 00:36:12.185
<i>there remains a fear.</i>

678
00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:15.939
<i>For they know that
danger is always lurking.</i>

679
00:36:15.963 --> 00:36:19.091
<i>and that no home is safe forever.</i>

680
00:36:22.136 --> 00:36:24.030
That's who's been messaging me?

681
00:36:24.054 --> 00:36:26.283
Yup. and cooked the footage.

682
00:36:26.307 --> 00:36:28.201
And maybe killed Lester.

683
00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:31.163
What does it say?

684
00:36:31.187 --> 00:36:33.790
<i>You're such a smarty-pants.</i>

685
00:36:33.814 --> 00:36:35.667
<i>Now. I need to come hunt you down.</i>
