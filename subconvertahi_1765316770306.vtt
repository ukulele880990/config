All you guys having a good time?

You gotta let it go. man.
There's good that came out of this.

7
00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.866
Yeah. we used him.
then we got him killed.

8
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.702
No. we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.163
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.457
- Look on the bright side. huh?

11
00:00:42.043 --> 00:00:45.380
[Steve] Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

12
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.884
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

13
00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.303
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

14
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.684
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

15
00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:02.355
Finally. the Colombian government
had to react.

16
00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.483
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

19
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.412
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

20
00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.914
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US.

21
00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:22.499
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

22
00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.836
This made all the difference in the world.

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:39.558
It was a fucking joke.

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.144

it was a whole different deal.

Extradition doesn't mean anything

38

[dry chuckle] It's one fucking man

is the time for solidarity.

You make the mistakes.
and then you preach solidarity?

- Shut up. fag.
- What the fuck. Carlos?

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:36.902
Why are you always defending him?

Gentlemen...

56
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.919
I suggest we form another organization

to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

58
00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.716

No. I've got it. Fabio. I've got it.

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:34.603
Done.

88
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.693
[Steve] By the way.
here's the logo $50.000 got you.

89
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.446
In the upcoming presidential election.
extradition became the defining issue

90
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.864
amongst the candidates.

91
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.534
Those the narcos could buy.
they bought.

92
00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:50.827
The ones they could scare.
they scared.

93
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.789
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

94
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.876
And so. unable to buy him
and unable to scare him.

95
00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.171
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery.

96
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.173
and he wrote Galán a letter.

97
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.970
[in English] "And to conclude. I want
to express my most energetic protest

98
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.766
over the improper interference
of North America

99
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.727
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

100
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.853
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

101
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:19.565
He's got some balls.

102
00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.358
Escobar is shameless.

103
00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:26.029
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency. Mr. Galán.

104
00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.157
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States.

105
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.119
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

106
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.080
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

107
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.041
My campaign manager.
Dr. Gaviria.

108
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.586
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

109
00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:44.673
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle.

110
00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:47.468
when clearly.
they're losing a war.

111
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.512
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

112
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.892
[in Spanish] If you speak in favor
of extradition. you will be their puppet.

113
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.312
and that will be your death sentence.

114
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:02.650
I don't care about the Americans. but I am
still going to support extradition.

115
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:05.986
Besides. if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country.

116
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.404
then let them take them.

117
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:08.989
[Steve]
Since he couldn't get to Galán.

118
00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.826
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

119
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.745
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

120
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:16.955
if no judge was willing to apply it.

121
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.627
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

122
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.963
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States.

123
00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:28.425
know we. the Extraditables.
will pass judgment on you

124
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.094
and bring a sentence far harsher."

125
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.472
The judges were so scared and intimidated

126
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.308
that special court procedures
had to be created.

127
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.853
For the first time
in the history of Colombia.

128
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.814
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

129
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.649
[in Spanish] Defendants. please rise.

130
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.196
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

131
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:56.203
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

132
00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:59.623
[Steve] Despite his threats.
many brave men defied him.

133
00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:05.253
And true to form.
when the pen failed...

134
00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.339
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

135
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.465
[engine starts]

136
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:16.348
In light of this terrorism.
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

137
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:20.268
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority. right?

138
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.770
Well. guess again.

139
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.733
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

140
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:29.444
All due respect. but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

141
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:33.240
We got FARC. we got M-19.
we got EPL. we got ELN.

142
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.868
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

143
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:39.705
Sorry. Agent Peña. but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems.

144
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.082
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

145
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.086
[Steve]
Communists. Remember them?

146
00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:50.591
With Reagan in the White House.
it was hard to forget.

147
00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:51.717
In his words:

148
00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:54.929
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

149
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.307
[Steve] The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing. always had been.

150
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.937
In Hollywood. he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

151
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.022
In Washington.
he created the Reagan Doctrine.

152
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.776
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

153
00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:12.320
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

154
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.991
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world.

155
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.242
you'd better be chasing reds.

156
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.829
Ambassador. if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets.

157
00:10:20.913 --> 00:10:22.873
the Colombians will get Escobar.

158
00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:26.001
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

159
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.712
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

160
00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:33.884
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

161
00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:37.220
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker. and as such.

162
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:42.267
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

163
00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:47.522
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

164
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.232
Let the Colombians get him.

165
00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:53.403
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100.000

166
00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:56.657
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah. it's a fucking joke.

167
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.492
That's about what he spends on shoes.
isn't it?

168
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.662
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

169
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.163
So what do we do now?

170
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.749
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

171
00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:10.420
[Steve] It's true.
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

172
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:13.256
But delivered into the right hands.
it could make a difference.

173
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:18.094
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia.
honorable men.

174
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:23.058
But the head of counternarcotics.
General Jaramillo. wasn't one of 'em.

175
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.271
And as such.
he was exactly what we needed.

176
00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.025
[in Spanish]
Thank you for seeing me. General.

177
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.734
You're welcome.

178
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:36.404
Listen. I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

179
00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:40.868
With all due respect. General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

180
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:44.120
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

181
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.040
Well. I don't want him to follow.

182
00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:48.542
I want him to lead.

183
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:55.632
Go ahead.

184
00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.844
Yes. General.

185
00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.055
As you wish.

186
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.305
Understood.

187
00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.519
What happened. honey?

188
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.396
Things with work.

189
00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.690
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

190
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:15.652
I'm making the chicken he likes.
but he's out with the girlfriend.

191
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.741
Tell me what's wrong.

192
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.660
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

193
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.084
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

194
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.088
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man.

195
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.840
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

196
00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:38.967
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

197
00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:41.053
[Pablo] Hm.

198
00:12:42.054 --> 00:12:45.557
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back. well. then...

199
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.559
I didn't hear them complaining. did I?

200
00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:50.311
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

201
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.231
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

202
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.152
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police. you know?

203
00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.528
And most of all. to the top brass.

204
00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:01.489
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

205
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:02.657
[Gustavo] Mm.

206
00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.622
Oh. shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

207
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.416
- [birds squawking]
- [Pablo] Egrets from the Himalayas.

208
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:12.459
[Gustavo chuckles]

209
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.003
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

210
00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.173
They cost me a million dollars.

211
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.097
[sighs]

212
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.431
Bastards.

213
00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.144
Stay in the fucking tree!

214
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:34.940
[Gustavo laughs]

215
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.739
Seems like you lost that dough.
eh. cousin?

216
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.910
That's your problem. Pablo.

217
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.496
You think that everything
can be controlled.

218
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:52.082
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

219
00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:58.005
OK. OK. OK. Gustavo... OK. [sighs]

220
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.383
[in English] Your English is really good.

221
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.595
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

222
00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.305
How long you been at the comuna?

223
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.474
Just a few weeks.

224
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.102
Is your husband
gonna help us here. too?

225
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:15.522
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

226
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.360
Oh. he's. uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

227
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:24.990
[up-tempo Latin music plays]

228
00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.576
- I fucked up.
- How?

229
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.204
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

230
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.413
No. Jaramillo's sending a message.

231
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:37.169
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

232
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.796
He's setting Carrillo up for failure.
and when he does fail.

233
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.215
he'll fire him for incompetence.

234
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:44.092
and me and you.
we lose the only cop we can trust.

235
00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:46.553
[women chuckling]

236
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:47.971
- Hey!
- Hey!

237
00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.764
- Sorry I'm late. honey.
- Mm...

238
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.309
Javier. this is my friend. Elisa.

239
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.187
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

240
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.312
Nice to meet you.

241
00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.817
Are you another... janitor at the embassy.
like Steve?

242
00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.986
No. actually. I'm CIA.

243
00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:06.489
But that's classified.
so don't tell anybody.

244
00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:10.118
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

245
00:15:10.202 --> 00:15:12.913
- The janitor thing. what. that was you?
- Mm.

246
00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.165
No. it's just a cover.

247
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.667
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

248
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.712
Just so you know.
I'm a communist guerrillera.

249
00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.839
[all chuckling]

250
00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.007
Perfect.

251
00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.676
[Steve] If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

252
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.304
we probably wouldn't have cared.

253
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.681
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

254
00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.851
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

255
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:37.979
He had better resources
and better information.

256
00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.523
And at the time.
he owned over 800 homes and fincas.

257
00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:43.610
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

258
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:47.281
And cops...
he owned a lot of them. too.

259
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:48.531
But not all of them.

260
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.078
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

261
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.705
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

262
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:58.041
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

263
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.753
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

264
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.382
Trapped a little bird.

265
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.094
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

266
00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.221
Jesus.

267
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.146
Just remember that you wanted all in.

268
00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.231
[Carrillo in Spanish]
Hand me that coffee.

269
00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:23.608
[man speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

270
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.611
[soft gasp]

271
00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:28.989
[cup clatters]

272
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.116
[man gasps sharply. coughs]

273
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.495
[in English] He already gave up
the name of three fincas.

274
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.831
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

275
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.960
[in Spanish] But you do know
where he is hiding. don't you?

276
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.066
[in Spanish] Look. little brother.

277
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.403
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

278
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.324
But I will also kill you.

279
00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.492
And very slowly.

280
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.705
[stammers weakly]
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

281
00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:23.418
Well. then. you should pray we find him.
and quickly.

282
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.299
[Steve] We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out.

283
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.927
but there was a small part of me
that thought. in his arrogance.

284
00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.138
he would stand and fight.

285
00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.682
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

286
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.642
[in Spanish] Boss!

287
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:40.727
Poison...

288
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.103
Boss!

289
00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:46.358
They were headed for El Bizcocho.
but they got off the main highway.

290
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.194
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

291
00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.528
Two hours. boss.

292
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:54.074
Round up the guys.
and tell them to get ready.

293
00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.076
- We're leaving.
- All right.

294
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.164
We have to go.

295
00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.458
Go where?

296
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.252
The police are coming.

297
00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.587
- But Pablo. I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry. my love.

298
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.549
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

299
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.509
We'll buy new ones later.
won't we?

300
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:15.970
[Pablo sighs]

301
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:18.639
[softly] I'm sorry.

302
00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:21.476
Do you hear me complaining?

303
00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:29.525
As long as you're with us. Pablo.
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

304
00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.537
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- [man] Yes. sir.

305
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.956
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

306
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.209
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

307
00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.585
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

308
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.130
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

309
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:56.761
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

310
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.513
[man] Yes. sir!

311
00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:00.598
[men chatter in Spanish]

312
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.407
What's wrong. Gustavo?

313
00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.868
You fucked us. Pablo.

314
00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.498
Not only you and me.

315
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.207
You fucked the whole family.

316
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.923
But of course. since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

317
00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:38.678
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country.

318
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:41.097
the rest of us get screwed.
isn't that right?

319
00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:48.771
But what the fuck...

320
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.608
a man only dies once. right?

321
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.988
[softly] Come here.

322
00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.163
[whispers] My brother.

323
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.791
[Pablo] I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on. come on.

324
00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.962
- [engine powering]
- There we go.

325
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.100
[Steve] I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

326
00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.644
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time.

327
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:33.107
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

328
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:37.278
You may have 800 houses. my friend.
but none of them is home.

329
00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:40.448
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life.

330
00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.493
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

331
00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:46.079
From now on.
nowhere is safe.

332
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.789
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

333
00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.517
[Steve] The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

334
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.936
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

335
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:15.233
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

336
00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:20.029
Hey. if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out. too.

337
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:24.033
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

338
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.911
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

339
00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:29.497
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

340
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.670
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit.
I got very lucky.

341
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:40.467
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

342
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.303
We raided it.
and guess who we found?

343
00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:45.555
Blackbeard.

344
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:49.016
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

345
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.604
In custody.
he would describe a cocaine empire

346
00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:56.524
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

347
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:59.402
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

348
00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:03.823
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice.

349
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.117
home of Colombia's supreme court.

350
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.744
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

351
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:14.542
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

352
00:22:14.626 --> 00:22:16.002
[whispers in Spanish] Fuck.

353
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:19.797
[whispers in English] Fuck.

354
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.924
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

355
00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:24.177
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

356
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.596
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

357
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.806
Javi. there's some good stuff in here.
stuff we can use.

358
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:31.058
[Javier]
None of it can leave the room.

359
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.936
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

360
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.856
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

361
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.609
[Steve]
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

362
00:22:45.657 --> 00:22:46.824
Take 'em.

363
00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.995
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

364
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.039
What are you talking about?

365
00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:55.583
[whispers] Do you want to catch Pablo
or not? [clears throat]

366
00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.422
- [softly] Why me?
- [whispers] Because they'll suspect me.

367
00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:03.966
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

368
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.760
They're not gonna
search a white boy. OK?

369
00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:08.095
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

370
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.263
Just do it.

371
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.893
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

372
00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:17.021
- [Steve] And sometimes. bad people...
- Señor.

373
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:18.356
...help you do good things.

374
00:23:19.357 --> 00:23:21.984
[Javier in Spanish] These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

375
00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:26.113
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

376
00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:28.658
Yes.

377
00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:33.788
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

378
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:35.373
Obviously. it's an alias.

379
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:39.377
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle." [soft chuckle]

380
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.713
Because he's not Colombian.

381
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:47.301
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

382
00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:49.136
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

383
00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:53.307
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

384
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:57.937
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

385
00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:03.067
Suarez. do you ever worry
what will happen to you

386
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.446
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

387
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:10.157
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

388
00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:13.869
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

389
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.663
[sighs]

390
00:24:15.747 --> 00:24:19.751
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

391
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:23.713
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

392
00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:29.051
[chats indistinctly in Spanish. chuckles]

393
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.179
Wha... What the fuck is this?

394
00:24:32.263 --> 00:24:33.889
This is me giving you homework.

395
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.350
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

396
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.185
And I need you to find out who it is.

397
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:41.147
First off. I don't fucking work for you.
Murphy. you hear me?

398
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.108
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

399
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:48.655
What's he up to these days?

400
00:24:48.738 --> 00:24:50.030
Barry Seal.

401
00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.416
[Steve] Barry Seal. a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football.

402
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.169
mind-altering chemicals.
and pussy...

403
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:05.797
which made him perfect CIA material.

404
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.092
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

405
00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:12.887
Finding Barry was easy.

406
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.056
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

407
00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:18.601
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite. too.

408
00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:21.270
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

409
00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:22.772
[laughing]

410
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:24.691
No. I'm serious.

411
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:27.067
[Steve]
Look.

412
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:30.363
[Javier] Oh. my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

413
00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:31.906
[in Spanish] Until next time.

414
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:38.412
- [in English] Goddamn. is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

415
00:25:39.664 --> 00:25:41.916
Come on. we got you a ride
waiting over here.

416
00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:43.668
[in Spanish] Hi. Vanessa.

417
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:47.380
[in English] It's fun to say. though.
ain't it? "McPickle"?

418
00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:51.091
[Javier clears throat]

419
00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:53.803
Have a seat. Barry.

420
00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:02.520
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

421
00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:05.314
- Well. you guys ain't got shit.
- [Javier chuckles]

422
00:26:05.398 --> 00:26:10.152
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

423
00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:12.238
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

424
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:17.034
Yeah? Well. let's see
if that holds up in court. huh?

425
00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:20.830
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

426
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:22.623
without making a refueling stop.

427
00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:26.043
Yeah. according to the records.
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

428
00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:28.671
The manifests don't lie.

429
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:32.884
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine.

430
00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:36.637
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department. wouldn't it?

431
00:26:36.721 --> 00:26:40.600
Well. damn... [chuckles]
you guys are good.

432
00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:42.017
Communist sympathizer.

433
00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.103
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big. red bow

434
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.980
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

435
00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:48.566
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments.

436
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:51.193
that's treason and trafficking.

437
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:53.654
What's that.
two life sentences for the price of one?

438
00:26:54.739 --> 00:26:55.865
[Javier] That's right.

439
00:26:58.952 --> 00:27:02.997
Well... see.
I figured this day might come.

440
00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:06.125
Why don't you uncuff me. boys.
I got something to show you.

441
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.334
Yeah? What's that?

442
00:27:07.418 --> 00:27:10.129
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

443
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:13.591
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on. uncuff me.

444
00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:16.176
[Steve]
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

445
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.222
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

446
00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:24.351
'Cause at the time. Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas.

447
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:27.229
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

448
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:30.024
for cocaine shipments to the US.

449
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:34.153
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

450
00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:35.571
I couldn't have made that up.

451
00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:37.531
- [Javier] Holy shit.
- [Steve] It was too good.

452
00:27:37.615 --> 00:27:40.409
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait. wait. wait. No.

453
00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:43.245
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

454
00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.791
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

455
00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:49.043
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

456
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:52.588
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

457
00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:54.924
- You know. I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

458
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:58.511
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

459
00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:11.148
[Steve] I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants.

460
00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:14.318
but frankly.
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

461
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:16.278
He was just another busted trafficker

462
00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:19.949
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

463
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:23.661
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

464
00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:26.914
to get the resources we needed.
then fuck him.

465
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.333
Strange bedfellows. indeed.

466
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:33.170
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

467
00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:35.339
Washington is gonna go crazy.

468
00:28:36.173 --> 00:28:37.842
Thank you. Ambassador.

469
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:42.262
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

470
00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:43.472
Of course.

471
00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:46.767
Thank you.

472
00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:53.774
[Steve] In Washington. "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

473
00:28:53.983 --> 00:28:57.862
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

474
00:28:58.071 --> 00:29:00.865
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

475
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:05.369
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

476
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:08.622
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

477
00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:11.959
This picture shows Federico Vaughan.

478
00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:15.880
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua.

479
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:20.927
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

480
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:26.223
No. there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

481
00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:29.560
[Steve]
Being a rat is a dangerous business.

482
00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:31.771
and Escobar's reach was long.

483
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:34.481
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

484
00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:36.567
- [automatic gunfire]
- [grunts]

485
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.695
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

486
00:29:39.904 --> 00:29:41.196
Whoops.

487
00:29:48.162 --> 00:29:50.706
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

488
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.918
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña. if he wanted a long life.

489
00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:56.754
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

490
00:29:56.963 --> 00:29:59.590
I didn't kill him. Escobar did.

491
00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:02.885
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

492
00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:05.138
Look on the bright side. man.

493
00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:09.100
[Steve]
From then on. according to Reagan.

494
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:12.645
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

495
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:16.356
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

496
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.401
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

497
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.906
planes. helicopters.
you fucking name it. Everything.

498
00:30:28.786 --> 00:30:33.124
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

499
00:30:33.207 --> 00:30:37.753
and burn 'em straight to the ground.
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

500
00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:40.881
We were kicking ass.
and the narcos were feeling it.

501
00:30:41.632 --> 00:30:44.426
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

502
00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:48.806
Despite all this. we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

503
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:52.601
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether.

504
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.436
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

505
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:55.562
Got it!

506
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:59.817
[Steve] The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia.

507
00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:03.362
Medellín's biggest processing lab.
and we hit it hard.

508
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.782
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

509
00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:09.618
but in the end.
it got us our biggest victory to date.

510
00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:13.998
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

511
00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:17.168
[in English]
In my tent is a bag with $50.000...

512
00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:19.253
ten times this if you give me one hour.

513
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:23.757
[in Spanish] There's no way out.
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

514
00:31:27.136 --> 00:31:29.889
[Steve] Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States.

515
00:31:29.972 --> 00:31:35.435
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

516
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:40.649
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

517
00:31:42.151 --> 00:31:45.779
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

518
00:31:45.863 --> 00:31:49.200
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán.

519
00:31:49.283 --> 00:31:53.537
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

520
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.956
Extradition would become his battle cry.

521
00:31:56.165 --> 00:31:57.958
[man in Spanish] Gentlemen?

522
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:01.003
Thank you.

523
00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:06.092
[Steve] And for the narcos.
this was a declaration of war.

524
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.304
[Duque in Spanish]
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

525
00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:14.600
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

526
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:18.353
against the legality of extradition.

527
00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:23.358
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

528
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:26.028
Can we buy someone in that court?

529
00:32:27.113 --> 00:32:29.198
Unfortunately. no.

530
00:32:29.282 --> 00:32:32.743
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

531
00:32:33.827 --> 00:32:36.830
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

532
00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:39.708
Brother... even after he's dead.

533
00:32:39.917 --> 00:32:43.170
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

534
00:32:43.254 --> 00:32:45.172
He's totally fucked.

535
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.882
This is gringo bullshit.

536
00:32:46.966 --> 00:32:50.761
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

537
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.097
We're next. aren't we?

538
00:32:53.306 --> 00:32:55.182
You're right.

539
00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:57.184
Pablito?

540
00:32:57.268 --> 00:32:58.769
Do you have an answer or what?

541
00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:08.403
Well... in my opinion. a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

542
00:33:09.155 --> 00:33:12.658
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

543
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:15.328
Carlos was one of us.

544
00:33:17.037 --> 00:33:22.209
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

545
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:24.544
But remember.
there's something they want more than us.

546
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:27.756
So. brothers...

547
00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:30.843
it's time to give them what they want.
isn't it?

548
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:31.969
[murmurs of approval]

549
00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:35.722
[Ivan in Spanish] I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

550
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:39.101
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

551
00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:43.563
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

552
00:33:43.647 --> 00:33:48.944
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

553
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.739
Two million US dollars.

554
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.450
It's very dangerous.

555
00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.414
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

556
00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:05.336
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous. right?

557
00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:14.511
[knocking at door]

558
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:18.098
[Pablo] But for us. brother...

559
00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:22.686
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

560
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:27.400
We have an historical obligation.

561
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:31.362
- We can't forget that.
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

562
00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:33.072
[Elisa] I'm his girlfriend.

563
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:42.248
Meet Pablo Escobar.

564
00:34:45.042 --> 00:34:46.335
Miss.

565
00:34:47.378 --> 00:34:49.088
- OK.
- We have a deal.

566
00:34:49.171 --> 00:34:50.589
All right. then.

567
00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:53.842
We were just leaving.

568
00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:55.261
Good night.

569
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:04.895
What the hell is this?

570
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:07.106
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

571
00:35:07.189 --> 00:35:10.901
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

572
00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:13.695
In exchange for what?

573
00:35:13.904 --> 00:35:18.325
Unless you are willing to be part of it.
I cannot say.

574
00:35:20.911 --> 00:35:25.416
It's a partnership.
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

575
00:35:25.499 --> 00:35:29.878
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

576
00:35:45.436 --> 00:35:46.812
[in English] Connie?

577
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.730
Elisa? What's going on?

578
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.066
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

579
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.152
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

580
00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:54.445
Yeah.

581
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.280
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

582
00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:57.572
About what?

583
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:01.743
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

584
00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:03.870
I don't know what it is.
but I know it's gonna be bad.

585
00:36:03.954 --> 00:36:06.957
Wait. Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

586
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:10.585
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

587
00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:12.129
and you need to hide me.

588
00:36:13.464 --> 00:36:15.048
OK. Come on.

589
00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:21.555
Steve's already at work.
but Javi lives downstairs.

590
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.898
I just hope he's here.

591
00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:33.400
[Javier] I am.

592
00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:36.945
- Well. what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

593
00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:38.531
I'll be right back. Go.

594
00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:45.204
- [Connie] She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

595
00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:48.248
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

596
00:36:48.332 --> 00:36:50.667
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

597
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.170
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

598
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:54.421
Escobar and M-19?

599
00:36:54.505 --> 00:36:56.798
She didn't tell me any details.
just that it would be bad.

600
00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:58.800
No... that doesn't make any sense.

601
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:01.678
She asked me to hide her.
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

602
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:02.804
OK. All right.

603
00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:05.224
[sighs. clears throat]

604
00:37:16.193 --> 00:37:17.194
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

605
00:37:17.403 --> 00:37:20.531
Ambassador. I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

606
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.242
- [reporter] ...supreme court building.
- Oh. my God.

607
00:37:24.493 --> 00:37:26.245
[Steve] "Oh. my God" is right.

608
00:37:26.328 --> 00:37:30.790
Financed by Escobar. the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

609
00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:33.377
and occupied the supreme court.

610
00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:36.671
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

611
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:40.426
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

612
00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:42.177
but it was all bullshit.

613
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:44.513
The military attacked.

614
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:46.473
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage.

615
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.018
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

616
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.646
Most of the M-19 were killed.

617
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:56.900
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

618
00:37:58.818 --> 00:38:04.283
setting fire to the room that contained
600.000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

619
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:08.036
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

620
00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:15.628
In the United States.
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

621
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.712
so they can't testify in court.

622
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:23.176
In Colombia. Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

623
00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:29.516
[reporter] The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

624
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.144
as cannon shells exploded inside.

625
00:38:32.936 --> 00:38:34.354
[loud knock at door]

626
00:38:36.148 --> 00:38:37.732
[pounding at door]

627
00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:41.487
- Where is she?
- Well. come on in.

628
00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:44.906
You. up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

629
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.283
Put the gun away.

630
00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:48.452
Put it away.

631
00:38:49.662 --> 00:38:51.664
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

632
00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:53.915
- Can I say something?
- No. you may not.

633
00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:57.544
Murphy... calm down.

634
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:01.256
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

635
00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.509
Your wife brought her to me.

636
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:07.929
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife. I truly do.

637
00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:10.056
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

638
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.059
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

639
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.316
If she can tie Escobar to the siege.
I say we bring her in.

640
00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:20.984
Well. she's M-19.

641
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:23.445
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

642
00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:24.779
and then she gets disappeared.

643
00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:27.115
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

644
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:29.326
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

645
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:31.745
Look. all she did was warn us.

646
00:39:31.828 --> 00:39:34.289
She's not on anybody's radar.

647
00:39:34.373 --> 00:39:36.458
She's not involved in anything.

648
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.466
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

649
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.968
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

650
00:39:47.177 --> 00:39:51.097
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

651
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:53.808
Folks. this is more complicated
than what it seems.

652
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:57.396
This was Escobar. classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

653
00:39:58.689 --> 00:40:01.233
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

654
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:04.444
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

655
00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:06.863
He doesn't hold grudges.
not if it suits his purposes.

656
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:10.867
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

657
00:40:11.076 --> 00:40:13.495
You willing to identify this informant.
Agent Peña?

658
00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:17.290
- No. I am not.
- Needless to say...

659
00:40:17.374 --> 00:40:20.960
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

660
00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:23.171
in light of this communist aggression.

661
00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:25.131
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

662
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.176
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

663
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.732
[low murmurs in Spanish]

664
00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:51.491
[in Spanish]
They're looking for us everywhere.

665
00:40:51.575 --> 00:40:53.535
What did you expect?

666
00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:55.579
That it would be any different?

667
00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:02.127
You did a very good job.

668
00:41:15.808 --> 00:41:19.394
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

669
00:41:19.603 --> 00:41:22.648
No. brother.
The truth is. you helped mine.

670
00:41:25.818 --> 00:41:27.360
You. Ivan...

671
00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:31.698
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

672
00:41:33.492 --> 00:41:36.244
The same one that freed this country.

673
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.836
Now it belongs to you.

674
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:53.762
With it. you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

675
00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:59.934
I promise you.
I will continue the fight.

676
00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:02.103
You earned it. brother.

677
00:42:03.605 --> 00:42:05.398
As for me...

678
00:42:06.733 --> 00:42:08.735
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

679
00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:11.279
We are also...

680
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:17.786
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

681
00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:21.164
And the fucking sword.
