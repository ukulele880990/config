2
00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.553
Looking fabulous. my lovelies.

3
00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:20.788
Today is Monday. August 11.

4
00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:23.056
and it is going
to be a great day

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.859
if we choose
to make the most of it.

6
00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.561
-Alicia.
-It's humid outside.

7
00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.262
but there's plenty
of bright sunshine.

8
00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.965
And it doesn't matter
if you are rich or poor.

9
00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.501
-Sunshine is free for everyone.
-Alicia!

10
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.537
I get what you're doing.
I did it. too.

11
00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:38.706
But these patients?
They're in the garden.

12
00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:42.577
They got planted here whenever.
and they'll never go anywhere.

13
00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:44.177
You can give 'em
all the love you like.

14
00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.981
but you've only got so much
of that to go around.

15
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.082
Hmm.

16
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:51.586
Are you a plant. Lewis?

17
00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.826
Hey. have you seen this?

18
00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.029
He responded to me.
I don't know. He...

19
00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.230
He winked or something.

20
00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.799
It's not like
what you see in the movies.

21
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.735
These patients--
their brainstems are intact.

22
00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.772
Their eyes move.
their bodies twitch.

23
00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.406
I wanted it
to mean something. too.

24
00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:15.510
But you'll see.
It's just random.

25
00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:26.754
Morning. Watson.

26
00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:28.288
Sherlock.

27
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.592
you're gonna get yourself killed
sneaking around like this.

28
00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:32.092
Wouldn't be the first time.

29
00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:34.361
Nice to see you. John.

30
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.699
You're looking a bit ripped.
has to be said.

31
00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.466
Man of your age.
What's the story there?

32
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:40.768
I exercise.

33
00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:43.236
Well. so do I.
Jumping jacks this very day.

34
00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.472
I'll wait for my six-pack
to arrive by post.

35
00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:48.375
That's mostly a diet thing.

36
00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:51.546
Anyway.
it's good to see you here.

37
00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:52.947
Nice city you have here.

38
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:54.616
Sense of its own history.

39
00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:56.718
Commendable lack of pretension.

40
00:01:56.818 --> 00:01:58.452
I'll look forward
to spending some time.

41
00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:00.588
-You're staying here
in Pittsburgh?
-A week. maybe.

42
00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:03.758
I have some digging to do. some
time to spend with a friend.

43
00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:05.225
All right. well. sounds good.

44
00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.061
What are we digging into?

45
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.198
Well. how about breakfast.
for a start?

46
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.702
-Toad in the hole.
-No. no.

47
00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.403
I'm not eating anything called
"toad in a hole."

48
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.172
Open your mind. Watson.
Sausage. Yorkshire pudding.

49
00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.942
I have a talk
to give this morning.

50
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.579
and this looks like
it might mess with my stomach.

51
00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.685
<i>No. no. absolutely not.</i>

52
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.285
<i>That's a fabrication by press.</i>

53
00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:34.454
<i>There is no crisis</i>
<i>at Diogenes Technologies.</i>

54
00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:38.191
<i>We continue to innovate</i>
<i>in the field of biotechnology.</i>

55
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.628
<i>Reports</i>
<i>to the contrary don't come</i>

56
00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.664
<i>from so-called whistleblowers.</i>

57
00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:45.298
<i>but rather</i>
<i>disgruntled former employees.</i>

58
00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:49.604
My brother cuts a fine line
of bollocks.

59
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:51.673
I'm not sure he's selling it.

60
00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:54.008
-Do you believe him?
-Should I believe him?

61
00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:55.610
What do you know?

62
00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:57.310
It's a risky thing.

63
00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.179
holding stock
in a major corporation.

64
00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.215
See. that sounds like
you definitely know something.

65
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.651
I know the man's wearing
too much makeup.

66
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:05.687
No one believes
you got a tan. Mycroft.

67
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.287
Are you staying here
while you're in town?

68
00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.023
I hate to intrude.

69
00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:11.224
-but it would help me
keep a low profile.
-Come on. Holmes.

70
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.293
I stayed with you
for months at a time.

71
00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:16.164
Make yourself at home.
Let me ask you.

72
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.999
I know you say
you barely spoke to Mycroft.

73
00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:20.902
but are you really rooting
for his company to fail?

74
00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.469
It's just brother stuff.

75
00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:24.739
Shakespeare told that story
better than I ever could.

76
00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:28.776
You've got a talk to give. Eat.

77
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.546
<i>I'm suspicious.</i>

78
00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:33.715
Well.
what are you suspicious of?

79
00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:36.349
You just said
things were going really well.

80
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.318
I'm suspicious of exactly that.

81
00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.655
The little tricks
you tell us to do in here.

82
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:42.090
The pauses. the questions

83
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.391
we're supposed to ask ourselves
before we act.

84
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.160
Right now. they're working.

85
00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.495
We're getting work done
at the clinic.

86
00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:50.363
I'm getting along with everyone.

87
00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.567
We're even going
to see Watson give grand rounds

88
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.068
at Van Kirk Memorial
this morning.

89
00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:56.704
Like. as a group. a team.

90
00:03:56.804 --> 00:04:00.307
Well. that all sounds
really positive.

91
00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.544
Is there another word
you could use

92
00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.346
to describe
what you've been feeling?

93
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.348
I'm happy.

94
00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.518
I've been happy.

95
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:13.588
Beck?

96
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.590
Yeah. Sorry.

97
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.226
I've been holding that in
for a minute.

98
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:21.461
Look. everyone here is good
at putting on a mask.

99
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.831
That's what we do all day.
every day.

100
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.768
Ingrid is normally really good
at it.

101
00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:28.169
I mean. I'm taking notes.

102
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.804
I'm sure the whole group is.

103
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.639
But that right there

104
00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:33.608
was a dog's balls impression
of a happy person.

105
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.176
One out of ten.

106
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:39.247
What do you say
we take Ingrid at her word?

107
00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.882
Good luck with that.

108
00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:45.052
I've been
where you are right now.

109
00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:46.721
Somehow I doubt that.

110
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:48.488
Yeah. I've been broke.
then rich.

111
00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.992
Then broke. then rich again.
I mean. I could keep going.

112
00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:52.459
It's a cycle
that I'm trying to break.

113
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.294
Hence all the
what-have-you here.

114
00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.764
You know. eventually.
I'll build up a big enough pile

115
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.100
and think
everything is going to be great.

116
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.570
but instead. I get hung up
on this empty feeling.

117
00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:07.775
"What do you want.
after you get what you want?"

118
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.844
Tricky place to be in.

119
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.314
<i>People are going to experiment</i>

120
00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.850
on their own genomes
with CRISPR.

121
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.351
It's just a given.

122
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.188
I correspond
with these folks freely.

123
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.256
and I'm going
to continue to do that.

124
00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.791
It's not an endorsement.

125
00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:26.861
I just don't see the angle
in shunning them.

126
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.096
Thank you.

127
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:33.868
Does anyone have any questions
for Dr. Watson?

128
00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:36.270
Yes.

129
00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:39.273
Uh. thank you for coming
to our hospital. Dr. Watson.

130
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.675
I've read about your clinic.

131
00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:42.243
It's. uh...
it's not just genetics. right?

132
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.778
You handle
the hardest situations?

133
00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:45.980
We do our best.

134
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.715
We have a patient here.
Lewis Collier.

135
00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.784
He's in a persistent
vegetative state.

136
00:05:49.884 --> 00:05:52.753
-Alicia. we've been over this.
-Sorry. Dr. Watson.

137
00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:54.021
I swear he responds to me.

138
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.488
Nurse Santos.

139
00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:57.625
Dr. Watson's here
to give grand rounds.

140
00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:00.962
This is a discussion
about CRISPR technology.

141
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.731
Does anyone have a question
on the topic?

142
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.367
- Great panel. Dr. Watson.
- Thank you.

143
00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.770
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

144
00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:13.406
Excuse me?

145
00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:16.577
Nurse Santos. right?

146
00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:18.746
Tell me.

147
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.314
I asked Lewis to blink twice

148
00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.649
if he can understand me.

149
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.084
A few times. there was nothing.

150
00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:24.685
but a few times.
I'm pretty sure he did.

151
00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:26.120
How long has Lewis
been a patient here?

152
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.722
Since 2010. He had a stroke.

153
00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.590
His wife didn't find him
until a day later

154
00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:31.359
when she got back from a trip.

155
00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.694
Have you talked
to his family about this?

156
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:36.264
The staff says that he hasn't
had a visitor in about a decade.

157
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.431
Look. I am not a troublemaker.

158
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.501
and I am not trying
to be annoying.

159
00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:41.903
But what if he is in there?

160
00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:43.237
What if he's just been
trapped inside himself

161
00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:44.705
this entire time?

162
00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:46.507
If a person
with locked-in syndrome was

163
00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:48.843
to slip through the cracks.
this is how it would happen.

164
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.578
A stroke.
no treatment for a day.

165
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.948
His initial EEG was abnormal.
and they never tested it again.

166
00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:55.650
We need to come up with a test

167
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.718
to determine
if Lewis's movements are random.

168
00:06:57.818 --> 00:06:59.287
What can you tell me about him?

169
00:06:59.387 --> 00:07:01.555
Looks like his wife died
a few years after his stroke.

170
00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:03.124
But also. Watson. a test?

171
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.525
We don't work here.

172
00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.694
Well. we're not working.
We're doing a test.

173
00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:08.896
I found a blog he used to write.

174
00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:11.032
Looks like
Lucky was a civil engineer.

175
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.567
-Lucky?
-That's how
he signed the entries.

176
00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:14.969
The whole thing is about

177
00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.637
the history of bridges
in Pittsburgh.

178
00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:18.940
It's actually
really interesting.

179
00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:26.514
-I said. this is interesting.
-Yeah. we heard you.

180
00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:33.921
Good morning. Lucky.

181
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.727
I'm going to ask
you a question if that's okay.

182
00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:42.296
It's something
that we know you can answer.

183
00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:45.333
so if you do.
we'll know you're in there.

184
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:49.337
In 2006. there was a bridge here
in the city that was renamed

185
00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:52.540
after environmentalist
Rachel Carson.

186
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.009
Can you tell me what street

187
00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.545
the Rachel Carson Bridge
was named after?

188
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.922
That's two.

189
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:12.426
Three.

190
00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.797
Four.

191
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.100
He stopped on four.

192
00:08:20.034 --> 00:08:22.870
The Fourth Street Bridge.
Exactly.

193
00:08:23.004 --> 00:08:24.772
It's nice to meet you. Lucky.

194
00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:26.173
My name is John Watson.

195
00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:29.210
If you'll let me.
I want to be your doctor.

196
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.158
We want to hear your story.
Lucky.

197
00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:47.995
When I get to the column that
has the letter you want. blink.

198
00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:51.399
and then I'll run my finger
along that row. okay?

199
00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.441
"I."

200
00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.411
Okay. good.

201
00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:04.912
Next letter.

202
00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:12.219
Lucky's wife was the only
one who talked to him for years.

203
00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.156
One day. a couple of years
after his stroke.

204
00:09:15.256 --> 00:09:16.924
he noticed
that she was losing weight.

205
00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:18.926
I want to do
something worthy of...

206
00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.695
<i>And then she had dark</i>
<i>circles under her eyes.</i>

207
00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:24.698
<i>And then one day...</i>

208
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.068
<i>she was gone.</i>

209
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:31.105
Nobody even thought
to tell Lucky what had happened.

210
00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.406
That was it.

211
00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:36.777
He spent years
watching his world go by.

212
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.579
My God.

213
00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.748
We're gonna transfer Lucky
to UHOP.

214
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:44.351
I mean. too many bad memories
at Van Kirk Memorial.

215
00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:45.953
He needs a fresh start.

216
00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:47.588
Of course. I'll make calls.

217
00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.457
What do we do for him
once he's here?

218
00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.293
What can we do for him
once he's here?

219
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:55.262
We need to redefine the idea
of a win.

220
00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.064
Lucky's never going to walk.

221
00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:58.399
He's never going to talk.

222
00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:00.634
But he still deserves
a meaningful life.

223
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.103
So what does that look like?

224
00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:03.871
Lucky can feel the stiffness
in his muscles.

225
00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:06.240
We can treat the spasticity
with a baclofen pump.

226
00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:08.776
It's exhausting to communicate
using those boards.

227
00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:10.644
Patients with locked-in syndrome
report pain

228
00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:12.446
from the effort of having
to keep their eyes open

229
00:10:12.547 --> 00:10:14.115
until it's time to blink.

230
00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:18.052
I had a neuro professor at Pitt
that retired early.

231
00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:19.320
He founded a company

232
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.788
to make a better
brain-computer interface

233
00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:22.723
for patients like this.

234
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.758
If we can get Lucky
into a trial for the tech.

235
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:27.061
he'll be able to control
a computer just by thinking.

236
00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:28.329
Perfect.

237
00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:29.930
See if you can get a meeting
with him.

238
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.398
"I wanna tell you a joke

239
00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:34.569
"about someone
who only eats plants.

240
00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:36.370
You've never heard
of herbivore."

241
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.172
Yeah. That.

242
00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:40.741
Lucky is a remarkable man.

243
00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:44.011
A true testament to
the human spirit in many ways.

244
00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:45.846
He also likes puns.

245
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.450
"Did you know they won't be
making yardsticks any longer?"

246
00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:50.918
He's a hero.

247
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:53.721
He also has
a terrible sense of humor.

248
00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:01.530
Sherlock?

249
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:06.867
Holmes?

250
00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:20.381
"Wield me"?

251
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:25.520
<i>Allez.</i> Watson!

252
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.188
Ha!

253
00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:32.126
Not bad. my friend.

254
00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:33.460
You've kept up
with your singlestick?

255
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:34.929
No. I'm just athletic.

256
00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:36.598
You have any idea
why your brother's calling me?

257
00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.732
Did you answer?

258
00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:44.071
Why is he calling me?

259
00:11:44.205 --> 00:11:46.874
I suspect he wants to know
if you've heard from me.

260
00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:58.185
The world thinks
you've been dead for a year.

261
00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:00.154
Why would he want to know that?

262
00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:07.261
Of course
you know I'm an amateur chemist.

263
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.163
amongst other things.

264
00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:13.334
Mycroft founded
Diogenes Technologies

265
00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:15.836
based on something
that came out of my lab.

266
00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:19.240
He cut me in. just enough
so he didn't quite steal it.

267
00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:22.176
But when I died-- "died"--

268
00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:24.778
most of what I had went
to various causes.

269
00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.247
including your clinic.

270
00:12:26.347 --> 00:12:29.450
To my brother.
I left a new chemical formula.

271
00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:31.352
I explained that
as a... a final gift.

272
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.088
a path to a hard-won peace.

273
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:35.422
So. what was it. really?

274
00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:38.092
There are certain flaws
in the formula.

275
00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:41.696
Flaws that are only
revealing themselves

276
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.264
now that contracts are signed

277
00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.032
and the product's
out in the world.

278
00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:47.001
It's a proper mess for Mycroft.

279
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:48.703
Who knows where it all ends?

280
00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:50.605
So you bankrupted
your brother's company?

281
00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:53.407
Better. perhaps.
to imagine a chain reaction.

282
00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:54.975
A process. once begun.

283
00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:57.612
that can lead only
to transformation.

284
00:12:57.746 --> 00:12:59.748
You're bankrupting a bunch
of companies?

285
00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.448
Cracks in the foundation.
Watson.

286
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.951
One edifice crumbles.
a better one arises.

287
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.521
Mycroft knows I have guile.

288
00:13:06.621 --> 00:13:09.957
He probably suspects I wouldn't
have set this in motion

289
00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:11.626
unless I can enjoy the show.

290
00:13:11.726 --> 00:13:13.927
So you're not here
investigating.

291
00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:16.297
You're more just...

292
00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:18.999
hiding out in Pittsburgh.

293
00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.904
You know
you can't do cocaine here.

294
00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:27.074
I haven't touched the stuff
in years.

295
00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:30.277
Okay. but when you're not busy.
you're bored.

296
00:13:30.344 --> 00:13:32.179
And when you're bored...

297
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:36.584
Well. we both know
what happens when you get bored.

298
00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:39.019
How could I be bored. my friend?
I've got you.

299
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.890
And I've got
the best show on Earth.

300
00:13:44.592 --> 00:13:46.327
<i>Repercussions of Diogenes'</i>

301
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.630
<i>tumble continue to be felt</i>
<i>across the en...</i>

302
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:50.331
Good morning. Mr. Collier.

303
00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:51.999
Shinwell Johnson.

304
00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:56.236
First year nursing student and
general dogsbody to John Watson.

305
00:13:56.337 --> 00:13:59.173
You're moving
to UHOP today. guv.

306
00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:02.843
Dr. Watson sent me to observe.
and to see if there's anything

307
00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:05.846
you want to discuss
before the move?

308
00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:17.458
I have to get that.

309
00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:19.527
That's the second call in a row.

310
00:14:20.528 --> 00:14:22.096
He's not going to stop.

311
00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:27.368
Hey. Shinwell.

312
00:14:27.502 --> 00:14:29.870
No. I got in early. I am...

313
00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:32.239
the only one here.

314
00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.910
Erase that. Erase that.

315
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.581
Sorry.
Uh. just talking to myself.

316
00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:42.851
No. I-I don't know
why Watson's not picking up.

317
00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:46.554
What's up?

318
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:48.889
Lucky said what?

319
00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:50.891
"Someone on this floor
dies today."

320
00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:52.861
- Lucky said that?
- What does it mean?

321
00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:55.162
Shinwell's not sure.
Lucky's not communicated since.

322
00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.231
He's probably wiped out
from the past day.

323
00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:58.867
Maybe it's the beginning
of a pun.

324
00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:01.935
We'll ask him
when he comes back around.

325
00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:04.438
In the meantime.
can the two of you head over

326
00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:06.006
to Van Kirk
to help with the transfer?

327
00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:09.276
I'll make sure the room's ready.

328
00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:13.147
What's this?

329
00:15:14.582 --> 00:15:18.419
Oh. uh. just a project
I want to do around here.

330
00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.622
Hmm.

331
00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:25.192
Well. the two of you are not
gonna be doing a project

332
00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.027
in my office.

333
00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:29.798
Not today. not tomorrow.
not ever.

334
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.566
Understood?

335
00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:32.933
Yup.

336
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.807
You're sure
this guy's going to show up?

337
00:15:38.907 --> 00:15:41.108
Dr. Schiff
was fanatically punctual.

338
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:44.445
-Not sure what's going on.
-Huh.

339
00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:50.317
-How do you handle it?
-Hmm?

340
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.386
Being sober.

341
00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:54.522
doing the work.

342
00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:57.090
Seems like a grind.
seems tedious.

343
00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:58.726
It can be.

344
00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:02.931
You probably fly
through some days.

345
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:07.769
and then there are probably
others when it's just too much.

346
00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:10.103
I mean. following a playbook.
how to work on yourself.

347
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.507
Always.
Every single freaking moment.

348
00:16:12.607 --> 00:16:14.843
Are we still talking about me?

349
00:16:15.677 --> 00:16:19.413
Don't you ever-- I don't know--
have a cheat day?

350
00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:21.148
I do.

351
00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.551
I have.

352
00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:25.687
Ingrid.

353
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.020
Oh.

354
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.623
How are you?

355
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.692
Dr. Schiff.
Thank you for meeting us here.

356
00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:32.927
-Um. this is Adam Croft.
-Hi.

357
00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:34.294
Call me Ethan.

358
00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:35.964
It's been a while
since you were in med school.

359
00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:38.833
Ethan. The brain-computer
interface you're working on.

360
00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:41.335
We just took on a patient that
would be a perfect candidate...

361
00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:45.038
I don't work
at Schiff Interfaces anymore.

362
00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:47.107
I don't work anywhere
at the moment.

363
00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:49.076
I'm doing some guest lecturing

364
00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:51.345
until
I can pick up a faculty job.

365
00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:53.280
But aren't you... Schiff?

366
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.849
I wish that mattered.

367
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:56.216
I have partners.

368
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.018
We're in a lawsuit.

369
00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:00.688
A couple of different lawsuits.
actually.

370
00:17:00.822 --> 00:17:03.290
You invented the BCI.
It's yours.

371
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.628
I know. And it's beautiful.

372
00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:10.832
Everything else. unfortunately?
Ugly.

373
00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.466
I. uh...

374
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:16.336
I brought the names of some of
the best interfaces out there.

375
00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:19.306
The patient's been in the ICU
for nearly 16 years.

376
00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:21.308
He's been bankrupt.

377
00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:23.076
We need a clinical trial.

378
00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:24.746
I wish I could help.

379
00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:28.248
Maybe take this just in case.

380
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.420
It's good to see you. Ingrid.

381
00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:35.455
Thank you.

382
00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:40.562
That is why I work very hard
not to take a cheat day.

383
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.965
He's drunk.

384
00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.667
It's 11:00 a.m.

385
00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.434
Trust me.

386
00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:48.870
I've spent a lot of time

387
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.639
in meetings with people
pretending to be sober.

388
00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:58.713
Morning. Lucky.

389
00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.848
We should be moving you
within an hour.

390
00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:03.150
Everyone at UHOP's
looking forward to having you.

391
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.453
Doctors.

392
00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:08.322
can I have a moment?

393
00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:14.028
The patient's name
was Cynthia Sawyer.

394
00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:16.798
They pronounced her
not ten minutes ago.

395
00:18:16.931 --> 00:18:18.866
"Someone on this floor
dies today."

396
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.300
Lucky's message from earlier.

397
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.536
How could he have known?

398
00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:23.571
It's an intensive care unit.

399
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:25.272
People die all the time.

400
00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:27.474
Sure. I guess.

401
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.283
Watson?

402
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.820
Detective Lestrade.
How've you been?

403
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.690
Divorced. I've been divorced.

404
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.357
She took the half of
my net worth that was left over

405
00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:19.060
from all the others
that got took.

406
00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.728
How many divorces we talking?

407
00:19:20.828 --> 00:19:22.229
This would make three.

408
00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:24.799
But hey.
I'm on the market now. handsome.

409
00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:26.199
Is that why you called?

410
00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.802
No. I have this patient.

411
00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:30.170
He's been in the hospital
for a long time now.

412
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.839
and I think he saw...

413
00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:34.742
Well. he thinks he saw
this nurse inject something

414
00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:36.044
into a patient's IV.

415
00:19:36.144 --> 00:19:38.046
That patient died.
It looked intentional.

416
00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:40.180
You're treating
a murder witness?

417
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.517
Well. he could be a witness
to multiple murders.

418
00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:44.719
There's this one nurse.

419
00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:47.421
Now. she's not always there. so
I figure she's a travel nurse.

420
00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.389
But every time
she's on Lucky's floor.

421
00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:50.992
someone dies.

422
00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.994
So. this Lucky?

423
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:54.896
He's seen a bunch of killings.

424
00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:57.665
but he's just now getting around
to telling someone about it?

425
00:19:57.732 --> 00:19:59.067
It's complicated.

426
00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:01.002
Can I talk to him?

427
00:20:01.102 --> 00:20:02.904
Depends on what you mean
by "talk."

428
00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:05.238
Lucky.

429
00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:08.042
Pretty ballsy name
for a guy in his position.

430
00:20:08.142 --> 00:20:10.812
I'm sorry. Your position.

431
00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:13.213
I get it now.

432
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.215
I mean.
I'm still completely confused.

433
00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:18.019
but I get
why this case is a "you" thing.

434
00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:19.787
-What are you confused about?
-This gentleman

435
00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:22.090
has a fixed perspective
on the world. let's call it.

436
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.925
And I'm supposed to believe
that. every so often.

437
00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:27.562
a nurse walks right into that
little box and does a murder?

438
00:20:27.662 --> 00:20:29.931
And in all that time.
he's never read a name tag

439
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:31.298
or seen the woman's face?

440
00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.800
Well. I only have
a detailed description

441
00:20:32.934 --> 00:20:34.202
of the first time it happened.

442
00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.603
And he didn't see a face then.

443
00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:37.572
but doesn't mean
it never happened.

444
00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:38.806
Can we. you know?

445
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.541
He hasn't said anything
for a while.

446
00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:43.376
It's exhausting to communicate
the way Lucky does.

447
00:20:43.477 --> 00:20:45.245
Once he gets some rest.
we'll know more.

448
00:20:47.148 --> 00:20:48.281
Hmm.

449
00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:50.785
"In limbo.
setting the bar low means

450
00:20:50.885 --> 00:20:52.285
setting the bar very high."

451
00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:54.254
Yeah. well he. um...
he likes puns.

452
00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:56.791
This was on his patient board
at Van Kirk.

453
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:58.291
so we copied it here.

454
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:00.061
Listen. you know I'm game.

455
00:21:00.128 --> 00:21:02.864
Run tests on that woman
that died at Van Kirk today.

456
00:21:02.964 --> 00:21:05.666
I'll sit with you
when Lucky comes back around.

457
00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:08.803
But until then. you either need
a lot more information

458
00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:10.470
or a much better detective.

459
00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:12.640
You got one of those
lying around?

460
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.975
Actually. I do.

461
00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:15.643
-Hey. screw you.
-No. don't be salty.

462
00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:17.812
I just happen to have
the best detective in the world.

463
00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:19.947
<i>You're looking for a woman.</i>

464
00:21:20.014 --> 00:21:22.415
Five foot six or taller.

465
00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:24.317
weighing more than ten stone.

466
00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:27.688
She worked in emergency rooms
during the pandemic.

467
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:30.625
and likely has
an orthopedic heel on one shoe.

468
00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:32.160
That's cool. That's cool.

469
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.895
I still don't know
how you do that.

470
00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:35.863
but it's cool.
How do you do that. seriously?

471
00:21:35.963 --> 00:21:37.965
Consider the facts.

472
00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:40.333
A consideration becomes
an inference.

473
00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.670
an inference
becomes a deduction.

474
00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:44.705
Uh-huh. So you don't want
to tell me how you did it?

475
00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:46.473
You know. I'm-a get
the singlesticks.

476
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:51.078
- That was a fluke.
- No. Holmes. it was not a fluke.

477
00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:56.017
Of course. this woman.
Murder Nurse.

478
00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:59.419
didn't just plop herself down
in front of Lucky

479
00:21:59.554 --> 00:22:01.856
and kill over and over again.

480
00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:03.791
In fact.

481
00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:08.529
that night back in 2020 might be
the only time she did that.

482
00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:12.332
But your man.
vision is not his only tool.

483
00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:14.535
Can't move his head.
so it's not even his best one.

484
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:17.138
So you're saying that
Lucky can hear her?

485
00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:19.674
I think your nurse
has a sonic signature.

486
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.475
When Lucky hears this.
he knows she's back.

487
00:22:22.543 --> 00:22:26.547
Soon. cometh the sound
of a code on the floor.

488
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:30.852
Chaos. then the
sacramental hush of death.

489
00:22:30.952 --> 00:22:32.820
Murder Nurse has struck again.

490
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.421
She's larger than average.

491
00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:36.157
makes heavy footfalls.

492
00:22:36.257 --> 00:22:38.059
so must be something distinct
about the pattern.

493
00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.760
Okay. what about the ER? COVID?

494
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:41.896
It's the flourish on my part.
but the reasoning's sound.

495
00:22:41.996 --> 00:22:45.800
I believe she commenced
this grim business in 2020.

496
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.202
Nurses in the front line
were getting shouted at.

497
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:50.905
spat on. read for filth.

498
00:22:51.005 --> 00:22:54.609
Your woman channels her contempt
for patients toward the weakest

499
00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:56.010
and most vulnerable among them.

500
00:22:56.077 --> 00:22:58.946
Hmm.

501
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:02.850
Oh. no. again?
It's not even breakfast.

502
00:23:04.417 --> 00:23:06.354
-Eat your toad in the hole.
-Oh. man. this is.

503
00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.356
this is awful.

504
00:23:08.455 --> 00:23:10.091
I'm not here.

505
00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:18.232
Hey. Mary.

506
00:23:18.332 --> 00:23:19.533
Is. uh. everything okay?

507
00:23:19.634 --> 00:23:21.502
You told the fellows
there's a nurse

508
00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:23.537
killing people
at Van Kirk Memorial.

509
00:23:23.638 --> 00:23:25.239
and then you just disappeared.

510
00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:27.041
You haven't been responding
to anybody.

511
00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:30.511
Yeah. I got locked
in a train of thought. um...

512
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:32.980
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you had company.

513
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.317
I don't. Oh. I will.
I-I was going to.

514
00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.386
Listen. I have to get back
to the office.

515
00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:41.522
I want the names of all
the travel nurses at Van Kirk.

516
00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:43.858
I'll make some calls.
What about your thing?

517
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.893
You're just gonna leave it here?

518
00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:50.965
Ingrid. something on your mind?

519
00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:52.667
Nothing.

520
00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:54.835
I'm good tonight.

521
00:23:54.936 --> 00:23:56.270
Everything's stable.

522
00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.339
I can translate there.

523
00:23:58.438 --> 00:23:59.840
She's bored.

524
00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:01.943
She's gonna do
something dangerous.

525
00:24:02.043 --> 00:24:05.179
I'm not bored. I'm normal.

526
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:08.849
You want details?

527
00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:10.384
Fine.

528
00:24:10.518 --> 00:24:13.554
There's a patient at the clinic.
he needs this BCI.

529
00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:15.356
a brain-computer interface.

530
00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:17.792
A doctor I know
just changed the game there.

531
00:24:17.858 --> 00:24:19.694
but he partnered
with these venture capitalists

532
00:24:19.794 --> 00:24:21.228
who have it all
tied up in court.

533
00:24:21.362 --> 00:24:22.495
You do sound bored.

534
00:24:22.596 --> 00:24:24.065
Annoyed is not bored.

535
00:24:24.198 --> 00:24:27.868
I want to help this patient.
The situation sucks.

536
00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:29.837
Still think you have
a big mistake incoming.

537
00:24:29.937 --> 00:24:31.272
This company. what's it called?

538
00:24:31.372 --> 00:24:32.740
Schiff Interfaces.

539
00:24:32.873 --> 00:24:35.242
That sounds like
Schiff Interfaces has...

540
00:24:35.376 --> 00:24:38.245
someone like us on
the other side of this lawsuit.

541
00:24:38.346 --> 00:24:40.581
A member of
the antisocial tribe.

542
00:24:40.715 --> 00:24:42.249
I don't know how you counter.

543
00:24:42.383 --> 00:24:46.087
unless you're willing to get
down in the mud. gouge eyes.

544
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.589
-Like we do.
-Like we did.

545
00:24:48.723 --> 00:24:49.924
Thank you. Glen.

546
00:24:50.057 --> 00:24:52.693
Because in therapy.
we don't gouge eyes.

547
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.264
so I guess your patient
is just... boned.

548
00:25:26.861 --> 00:25:28.062
Lucky.

549
00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:32.066
They say you're in there.
What a story.

550
00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:35.970
I talked to a couple of the
girls over at Van Kirk today.

551
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.939
Nurses. we...
we love to chatter.

552
00:25:39.073 --> 00:25:41.308
They say there's
an investigation into a woman

553
00:25:41.442 --> 00:25:43.778
who died in their ICU yesterday?

554
00:25:43.878 --> 00:25:48.182
They say you're the one
who started the whole thing.

555
00:25:51.085 --> 00:25:52.253
Lucky.

556
00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:57.358
Lost to the world.
but watching us the whole time.

557
00:25:58.225 --> 00:26:00.529
What did you see?

558
00:26:00.628 --> 00:26:02.531
What did you say?

559
00:26:03.532 --> 00:26:06.067
Well. doesn't matter too much.

560
00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:08.436
Most patients.
they're like most people.

561
00:26:08.537 --> 00:26:10.171
Staring at their phones.

562
00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:12.073
Scrolling through
conspiracy theories.

563
00:26:12.173 --> 00:26:15.544
getting meaner and dumber
every second.

564
00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:19.713
That's not you. though.

565
00:26:20.748 --> 00:26:23.017
You seem like
something different.

566
00:26:25.653 --> 00:26:28.756
And this...
this might sound weird.

567
00:26:28.823 --> 00:26:30.891
but I wish you well.

568
00:26:58.385 --> 00:26:59.887
Lucky's been unresponsive
for too long.

569
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.556
He's lying limp.
his eyes are half closed.

570
00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:03.691
Maybe another stroke?
We should do a non-contrast CT

571
00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.292
to check for
intracranial bleeding.

572
00:27:05.392 --> 00:27:07.294
It could be an infection
causing stroke recrudescence.

573
00:27:07.361 --> 00:27:08.929
Beats a stroke by a long way.

574
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:10.731
Treat the infection. the
non-responsiveness goes away.

575
00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:14.768
Exactly. CBC. blood cultures.
urinalysis. urine cultures.

576
00:27:14.869 --> 00:27:16.505
Okay. good. Get it all going.

577
00:27:19.707 --> 00:27:21.308
Or...

578
00:27:21.408 --> 00:27:23.545
the man saw a murder.

579
00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:27.516
That makes him very inconvenient
for the killer in question.

580
00:27:27.582 --> 00:27:29.116
Key word being "killer."

581
00:27:29.216 --> 00:27:31.485
If Murder Nurse wanted Lucky
dead. wouldn't he be dead?

582
00:27:31.586 --> 00:27:33.754
Probably. Maybe.

583
00:27:33.888 --> 00:27:36.223
It's a tricky thing.
killing someone.

584
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.661
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

585
00:27:40.728 --> 00:27:42.029
Dr. Derian makes a good point.

586
00:27:42.096 --> 00:27:44.231
Murder Nurse could have
been interrupted.

587
00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:47.101
This could've been a first step
in a two-stage plan.

588
00:27:47.234 --> 00:27:49.703
This kind of thing has happened
before plenty of times.

589
00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:50.838
unfortunately.

590
00:27:50.905 --> 00:27:52.541
Look into angels of death.

591
00:27:52.641 --> 00:27:54.275
find out what type
of methods they used.

592
00:27:54.408 --> 00:27:56.977
see if any of those can explain
Lucky's change in status.

593
00:27:59.747 --> 00:28:02.316
I got the travel nurses
at Van Kirk.

594
00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:04.653
The one on top?
According to her supervisor.

595
00:28:04.752 --> 00:28:05.953
she wears an orthotic shoe.

596
00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.922
- "Haven Henry."
- John.

597
00:28:08.022 --> 00:28:13.093
she has a contract here. too.
at the South Hills satellite.

598
00:28:22.537 --> 00:28:25.306
Yeah. we got you now.
Mr. Collier.

599
00:28:26.407 --> 00:28:29.143
And I ain't gonna leave
this room until you're better.

600
00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:30.711
All right?

601
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:32.713
This woman has
a distinctive footfall.

602
00:28:32.813 --> 00:28:34.481
It's more audible
than it would be otherwise

603
00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:37.586
because she's heavier than
average with a distinctive gait.

604
00:28:37.686 --> 00:28:39.954
That's how Lucky tracked
her comings and goings?

605
00:28:40.054 --> 00:28:42.957
We hope to get more from Lucky.
but. hey. it all makes sense.

606
00:28:43.057 --> 00:28:44.792
It's brilliant.

607
00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:47.328
Extravagant. but brilliant.

608
00:28:47.428 --> 00:28:50.297
I want to meet this guy.
the world's greatest detective.

609
00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:52.366
I'm-I'm sorry. who?

610
00:28:52.466 --> 00:28:54.068
You ran out yesterday.
and you said

611
00:28:54.168 --> 00:28:56.136
you had access to the
world's greatest detective.

612
00:28:56.237 --> 00:28:58.607
I assume that's why I'm holding
this personnel file.

613
00:28:58.673 --> 00:29:01.308
Yeah. that was just
a figure of speech.

614
00:29:01.442 --> 00:29:03.344
I'm sorry. if you're right.

615
00:29:03.444 --> 00:29:05.980
this woman has been
killing people for years.

616
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.816
She is on her second
travel contract at my hospital.

617
00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:10.150
What can we do?

618
00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:11.752
Well. she's not at UHOP now.
is she?

619
00:29:11.852 --> 00:29:14.121
No. I told her supervisor
to have her stay home today

620
00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:15.523
and say we're overstaffed.

621
00:29:15.657 --> 00:29:17.424
They'll keep her off the floor
at Van Kirk. too.

622
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:19.326
All right. well.
that's under control.

623
00:29:19.426 --> 00:29:21.428
I can call the other hospitals
that she's worked for.

624
00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:22.830
build a paper trail.

625
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.166
But without actual evidence
or an eyewitness.

626
00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:29.604
I can't arrest her.
We need Lucky back.

627
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:31.138
We're working on it.

628
00:29:31.238 --> 00:29:32.741
What about insulin?

629
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.375
Worked for Elizabeth Wettlaufer.

630
00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:37.746
Lucky's glucose is normal.
Tests came back ten minutes ago.

631
00:29:39.146 --> 00:29:40.515
Paralytic?

632
00:29:40.615 --> 00:29:42.651
It-It's not a murder method
when you're ventilated.

633
00:29:42.717 --> 00:29:44.385
but it explains
pretty much everything.

634
00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:46.787
A shot wouldn't last that long.

635
00:29:46.887 --> 00:29:49.724
and we know that Lucky's
not getting repeated injections.

636
00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:53.193
Oh. um.

637
00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:57.064
can I get a number for your
old professor? Dr. Schiff?

638
00:29:57.164 --> 00:29:58.667
Why? He can't help us.

639
00:29:58.733 --> 00:30:02.704
I'm trying to help him.
if he wants it.

640
00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:07.241
It's called a Twelfth Step call.

641
00:30:07.374 --> 00:30:09.009
Someone's suffering. you visit.

642
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.146
tell them there's a better way.
if they're looking for one.

643
00:30:12.212 --> 00:30:13.581
What do you get out of it?

644
00:30:13.682 --> 00:30:15.684
I get to stay sober today.
hopefully.

645
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.384
I get to work the steps.

646
00:30:17.484 --> 00:30:19.554
Ugh. "The work."

647
00:30:19.654 --> 00:30:21.455
It is boring.

648
00:30:21.556 --> 00:30:24.391
But it's also
how you get better.

649
00:30:26.894 --> 00:30:28.495
Why are all those crossed off?

650
00:30:28.596 --> 00:30:30.598
Uh. because they're bad ideas.

651
00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:33.067
I'll be the judge of that.

652
00:30:35.035 --> 00:30:36.870
Call Sasha and Stephens.
Tell them to meet us

653
00:30:36.937 --> 00:30:38.872
in Lucky's room
with a crash cart

654
00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:42.544
and four milligrams
per kilogram of sugammadex.

655
00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:46.280
Why would he need a crash cart?

656
00:30:48.482 --> 00:30:49.784
<i>A paralytic won't kill Lucky.</i>

657
00:30:49.917 --> 00:30:51.285
but a paralytic
makes perfect sense.

658
00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:52.721
Explain that. please.

659
00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:53.987
Murder Nurse
would only move against Lucky

660
00:30:54.088 --> 00:30:55.590
if she knew she was suspect.

661
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.625
-Murder Nurse? Haven Henry.
-Let's keep things simple.

662
00:30:57.726 --> 00:31:00.394
If Murder Nurse kills Lucky.
the spotlight turns on her.

663
00:31:00.494 --> 00:31:02.630
People are reviewing
security cameras on his floor.

664
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:04.264
-It's bad for her.
-Exactly.

665
00:31:04.365 --> 00:31:06.433
But if she filled his IV bag
with rocuronium.

666
00:31:06.568 --> 00:31:08.837
meaning he gets
a continuous dose over time.

667
00:31:08.936 --> 00:31:10.270
Lucky's still alive.

668
00:31:10.404 --> 00:31:12.106
The world thinks he's just
not responding right now.

669
00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:13.941
Murder Nurse can come back.
keep him paralyzed

670
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:15.577
again and again
until things calm down.

671
00:31:15.677 --> 00:31:17.144
Then she has a window
to do what she needs to do.

672
00:31:17.244 --> 00:31:18.680
Which is murder. by the way.

673
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.247
Why do we need a crash cart?

674
00:31:20.314 --> 00:31:22.916
Murder Nurse gave Lucky
a paralytic in his IV bag.

675
00:31:22.983 --> 00:31:25.620
He plans to administer
the sugammadex.

676
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.954
It's dangerous. though.

677
00:31:27.087 --> 00:31:28.757
If we don't know
how much paralytic Lucky got.

678
00:31:28.823 --> 00:31:30.792
we don't know how much
of the reversal agent he needs.

679
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:33.293
And if we get the dosage wrong.
Lucky can go into anaphylaxis.

680
00:31:33.427 --> 00:31:34.995
That's what
the crash cart is for.

681
00:31:35.095 --> 00:31:36.564
Prepare a dose of epinephrine.

682
00:31:36.631 --> 00:31:37.766
We could just wait
for the paralytic to wear off.

683
00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:39.032
Lucky is suffering now.

684
00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:40.067
He's the target
of a serial killer.

685
00:31:40.134 --> 00:31:41.068
We're not waiting.

686
00:31:41.135 --> 00:31:42.804
Keep that epi ready.

687
00:31:42.936 --> 00:31:44.138
If I'm right about this.
Lucky will be able

688
00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:45.607
to move his eyelids
to communicate

689
00:31:45.673 --> 00:31:46.875
in 30 seconds or less.

690
00:31:54.415 --> 00:31:56.651
Lucky.
I hope that you can hear me.

691
00:31:56.751 --> 00:31:58.919
and I really hope
you can respond.

692
00:31:58.986 --> 00:32:01.021
Do you recognize this woman?

693
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:03.625
Is this the woman
you've been talking about?

694
00:32:04.692 --> 00:32:06.828
Blink twice if it is.

695
00:32:10.632 --> 00:32:13.033
That's one blink. He's back.

696
00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:16.437
And there's two.

697
00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:18.372
Get Detective Lestrade.

698
00:32:18.506 --> 00:32:20.340
We've got our witness.

699
00:32:25.379 --> 00:32:26.881
Cynthia Sawyer. the woman
who just died at Van Kirk.

700
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.148
We have her initial tests back.

701
00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:29.818
She had evidence
of synthetic insulin

702
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.453
in her blood. but she wasn't
being treated for diabetes.

703
00:32:32.554 --> 00:32:35.623
She's injecting insulin
to induce hypoglycemia.

704
00:32:35.723 --> 00:32:37.892
Haven Henry.
That's how she's killing people.

705
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:40.628
You've all been looking into
her jobs. What have you learned?

706
00:32:40.728 --> 00:32:42.396
She works in Indianapolis.

707
00:32:42.463 --> 00:32:44.965
I've been tracking
15 suspicious deaths so far.

708
00:32:45.065 --> 00:32:47.067
Another 11 in Grand Rapids.

709
00:32:47.134 --> 00:32:49.069
And here? Pittsburgh? UHOP?

710
00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:52.774
Cynthia Sawyer.
a few others at Van Kirk.

711
00:32:52.841 --> 00:32:54.975
UHOP South Hills doesn't have
a long-term care unit.

712
00:32:55.108 --> 00:32:56.210
so nothing there.

713
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.479
Just spoke
to Detective Lestrade.

714
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.949
Haven Henry flew to London
right after her supervisor

715
00:33:01.048 --> 00:33:02.517
told her to stay home.

716
00:33:02.617 --> 00:33:05.920
From there. she took a Hastings
Airline flight to Hanoi.

717
00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:07.187
It lands in four hours.

718
00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:08.890
So. we tell it to turn around.

719
00:33:08.989 --> 00:33:10.925
It's no longer in our airspace.
Our laws don't apply.

720
00:33:10.991 --> 00:33:13.093
It's registered to Britain.
We've reached out.

721
00:33:13.193 --> 00:33:14.261
but it's gonna take time.

722
00:33:14.328 --> 00:33:15.630
She'll be on the ground soon.

723
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.866
On the ground in Vietnam?

724
00:33:17.966 --> 00:33:20.133
Where there's
no extradition treaty?

725
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.202
What do we do?

726
00:33:22.302 --> 00:33:24.606
Well. it's not
a medical issue anymore.

727
00:33:24.706 --> 00:33:26.574
It's law enforcement now.

728
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:31.211
Watson. this woman
has killed patients

729
00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:32.747
all over the Northeast.

730
00:33:32.847 --> 00:33:34.549
Here in Pittsburgh.

731
00:33:34.682 --> 00:33:36.951
We still got four hours.

732
00:33:38.953 --> 00:33:40.487
You've all come so far.

733
00:33:40.588 --> 00:33:42.356
I'm grateful for that.

734
00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:43.958
Keep at it. I'll check in.

735
00:33:44.024 --> 00:33:46.661
-Where are you going?
-I said. keep at it!

736
00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:50.364
I will check in.

737
00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.508
Sherlock?

738
00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:03.678
Sherlock?

739
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.182
I have to leave
earlier than expected.

740
00:34:10.183 --> 00:34:11.786
Sorry we didn't get a chance

741
00:34:11.886 --> 00:34:13.655
to dig into
the Pittsburgh mystery.

742
00:34:13.755 --> 00:34:15.489
-We'd have fun there. Watson.
-I need your help.

743
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.725
There's a plane
that's in the air.

744
00:34:17.859 --> 00:34:20.260
A murderer is on her way
to Vietnam.

745
00:34:20.394 --> 00:34:22.664
It's traveling through
several countries' airspaces

746
00:34:22.764 --> 00:34:24.431
within 30 minutes.
Now. when it lands.

747
00:34:24.532 --> 00:34:26.801
we're gonna lose her forever.

748
00:34:28.736 --> 00:34:31.238
That is a pickle. Which airline?

749
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:33.273
Hastings.

750
00:34:33.407 --> 00:34:35.242
Holmes. what...?

751
00:34:38.012 --> 00:34:40.915
Inspector
Gregson's office. please.

752
00:34:45.452 --> 00:34:48.723
Yes. hello.
Um. this is a concerned citizen.

753
00:34:48.823 --> 00:34:50.959
Is the inspector there?
I-I have a tip.

754
00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:52.994
Fair enough. Could you please

755
00:34:53.093 --> 00:34:54.762
tell him I have a friend--

756
00:34:54.862 --> 00:34:56.698
real name Richard Bent.

757
00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:58.766
he may be flying
under an alias--

758
00:34:58.866 --> 00:35:01.603
he's on Hastings Air Flight...

759
00:35:01.703 --> 00:35:03.938
-429.
-429.

760
00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:08.776
I found certain journals.
which are alarming.

761
00:35:08.876 --> 00:35:10.878
I believe he's planning
to set off a bomb.

762
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:14.816
either in the air
or when it lands.

763
00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:16.618
Thank you.

764
00:35:16.718 --> 00:35:18.485
You just called in
a terror threat.

765
00:35:18.586 --> 00:35:21.188
More like a threat of a threat.

766
00:35:21.288 --> 00:35:24.157
Anyway. they'll ground
that plane.

767
00:35:24.257 --> 00:35:27.829
Make sure to grab
Miss Murder Nurse when they do.

768
00:35:30.497 --> 00:35:31.566
"Thank you. Sherlock."

769
00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:34.035
I'm worried about you. Sherlock.

770
00:35:34.134 --> 00:35:37.672
I'm really worried. I mean.
listen. helping one person.

771
00:35:37.772 --> 00:35:39.807
curing a disease.
catching a criminal.

772
00:35:39.907 --> 00:35:42.409
I get all of that.

773
00:35:42.476 --> 00:35:44.746
It seems like you're out
to help the whole world.

774
00:35:44.846 --> 00:35:46.279
That's dangerous.

775
00:35:47.214 --> 00:35:51.519
There are a lot of bad people
that got started just like that.

776
00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:54.956
Lucky for us.
I'm not a bad person.

777
00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:10.038
"The new Allegheny River
Turnpike Bridge

778
00:36:10.138 --> 00:36:11.506
"is currently
under construction.

779
00:36:11.606 --> 00:36:13.975
"The current old bridge.
a sturdy.

780
00:36:14.042 --> 00:36:16.044
trusty old marvel
of truss construction..."

781
00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:17.779
I hear you have news.

782
00:36:17.879 --> 00:36:21.481
I do indeed. Hastings Air
Flight 429 has been grounded

783
00:36:21.549 --> 00:36:23.685
in the nation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

784
00:36:23.818 --> 00:36:26.154
Haven Henry is on her way back
to the USA.

785
00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:28.388
and I will be there
at the airport to meet her.

786
00:36:28.488 --> 00:36:30.758
Incredible. What a break.

787
00:36:30.858 --> 00:36:34.028
Tell me about this
world's greatest detective.

788
00:36:34.128 --> 00:36:35.697
calls in the odd bomb threat?

789
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.734
There's nothing to tell.
I guess we got lucky.

790
00:36:41.969 --> 00:36:43.838
Why'd you want to meet
in Lucky's room?

791
00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:48.509
Maybe I heard this is where
the good puns are hiding.

792
00:36:48.576 --> 00:36:51.278
Maybe I heard
about another candidate

793
00:36:51.378 --> 00:36:52.747
for the loneliest person
in the world.

794
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.049
and my competitive
instincts kick in.

795
00:36:55.817 --> 00:36:59.087
Maybe I just get stuck
in my own head. too.

796
00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:02.255
I think about divorce.
bank statements.

797
00:37:02.389 --> 00:37:04.692
dying alone.

798
00:37:04.759 --> 00:37:06.160
I like this guy.

799
00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:09.130
He doesn't interrupt.

800
00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.833
I'll leave you to it.

801
00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:14.669
Until next time. Dr. Watson.

802
00:37:15.903 --> 00:37:17.839
Don't be a stranger.

803
00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:26.214
"I remember my dad
used to complain bitterly

804
00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:29.016
about how terrible
the traffic was when crossing."

805
00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:32.820
Dr. Schiff? Ethan. sorry.

806
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.655
I was surprised
to hear from you.

807
00:37:34.756 --> 00:37:37.324
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

808
00:37:37.424 --> 00:37:39.894
Better than okay. actually.

809
00:37:39.994 --> 00:37:42.196
Things are good.

810
00:37:42.295 --> 00:37:44.632
It's been a while
since I could say that.

811
00:37:44.732 --> 00:37:47.969
The venture capital firm
that I got in bed with?

812
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:49.269
They dropped their lawsuit.

813
00:37:49.402 --> 00:37:52.106
Really? Did they say why?

814
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.241
No idea.

815
00:37:53.306 --> 00:37:55.109
They're stepping back.

816
00:37:55.243 --> 00:37:58.045
A minority partnership.

817
00:37:58.112 --> 00:38:02.250
The brain-computer interface.
it's mine again.

818
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:06.053
I would love to welcome
your patient into a trial.

819
00:38:06.788 --> 00:38:10.457
You don't know anything
about how this happened. do you?

820
00:38:10.558 --> 00:38:12.160
Of course not.

821
00:38:12.292 --> 00:38:16.130
Sorry. It's just so
out of the blue.

822
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.632
I'm looking for a reason.

823
00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:19.600
Congratulations.

824
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.103
I'll arrange a meet for you two.

825
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.405
Ingrid?

826
00:38:25.506 --> 00:38:27.809
You don't know why
your-your colleague

827
00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:29.844
keeps leaving me messages.
do you?

828
00:38:29.977 --> 00:38:33.848
No clue. Maybe call him back.

829
00:38:47.327 --> 00:38:49.897
You're not gonna say thank you?

830
00:38:49.997 --> 00:38:51.364
For what?

831
00:38:52.332 --> 00:38:54.367
Schiff Interfaces.

832
00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:56.403
I know the VCs. I called them.

833
00:38:56.504 --> 00:38:58.438
Mm. you call them.
and they drop their lawsuit?

834
00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:00.875
Well. I have this kid
at the incubator.

835
00:39:00.975 --> 00:39:04.145
He's got everyone excited
about some AI thing.

836
00:39:04.245 --> 00:39:06.446
Honestly. I'm not even sure
if it's a good idea.

837
00:39:06.514 --> 00:39:09.150
but the space is white-hot.

838
00:39:09.217 --> 00:39:13.054
That's right. You have
an incubator. it's called?

839
00:39:13.187 --> 00:39:16.456
I promised the kid's idea
to the VCs at Schiff.

840
00:39:16.524 --> 00:39:18.059
but only if they
settled their lawsuit

841
00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:20.161
and brought the doctor in
from the cold.

842
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:22.163
Took about ten seconds.

843
00:39:22.263 --> 00:39:23.998
The interface
never scaled past patients

844
00:39:24.098 --> 00:39:25.333
with locked-in syndrome.

845
00:39:25.432 --> 00:39:28.401
And why would you do all that?

846
00:39:29.737 --> 00:39:30.838
I don't know.

847
00:39:30.905 --> 00:39:33.140
Fun.

848
00:39:33.241 --> 00:39:35.576
To gouge eyes.

849
00:39:35.676 --> 00:39:37.645
Or maybe because
you asked me to.

850
00:39:37.712 --> 00:39:39.881
Don't remember that.

851
00:39:40.748 --> 00:39:42.382
Yeah. you did.

852
00:39:42.516 --> 00:39:45.319
The other day.
when you shared. you asked.

853
00:39:45.385 --> 00:39:46.921
Well done.

854
00:39:49.422 --> 00:39:51.759
Anyway. you're welcome.

855
00:39:51.893 --> 00:39:53.928
I'm not going to say thank you.

856
00:39:54.862 --> 00:39:58.699
But when we're done
with the session today.

857
00:39:58.799 --> 00:40:00.234
you can give me your address.

858
00:40:00.334 --> 00:40:03.436
If it's clean. and you're
there alone at 9:00 tonight.

859
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:04.739
I'll be there.

860
00:40:06.007 --> 00:40:09.409
Told you. Big mistake incoming.

861
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.979
More like a cheat day.

862
00:40:13.281 --> 00:40:16.183
You're both here. Good.

863
00:40:17.585 --> 00:40:19.320
Uh...

864
00:40:20.388 --> 00:40:22.390
Let's get started.

865
00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:24.825
You waiting for me?

866
00:40:31.365 --> 00:40:34.602
You've done a good job
with these fellows. John.

867
00:40:34.735 --> 00:40:37.872
They all want to do extra work.
They all want to do good work.

868
00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:39.540
And I'm proud of them.
All of them.

869
00:40:39.607 --> 00:40:41.142
Then why did you bail twice

870
00:40:41.242 --> 00:40:42.910
when they're trying
to help you fix a problem?

871
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.446
You ran out on that detective.
too. from what it sounds like.

872
00:40:46.547 --> 00:40:47.815
They all feel that.

873
00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:50.384
Now. the fellows.
they haven't complained to me.

874
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:52.987
and I'd tell them to take it up
with you if they did.

875
00:40:53.087 --> 00:40:55.488
but I promise you. they feel it.

876
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:58.659
Is everything okay. John?

877
00:41:00.628 --> 00:41:02.797
Guv? Guv?

878
00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:07.668
John Watson.

879
00:41:07.768 --> 00:41:11.339
I trust you remember me.
My name is Mycroft Holmes.

880
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:15.142
Yes. of course.
Good to see you again.

881
00:41:15.276 --> 00:41:18.079
You as well.
Forgive the surprise.

882
00:41:18.145 --> 00:41:19.981
I find it best
in these situations

883
00:41:20.114 --> 00:41:21.415
to drop in unannounced.

884
00:41:21.481 --> 00:41:23.017
"These situations"?

885
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.621
Well. I'm here to evaluate
my investment in this clinic.

886
00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:30.091
Sherlock funded
this clinic. not you.

887
00:41:30.157 --> 00:41:32.827
My brother is dead. isn't he?

888
00:41:34.028 --> 00:41:35.663
Sherlock excelled
at many things.

889
00:41:35.763 --> 00:41:37.198
but I can assure you
that crafting

890
00:41:37.298 --> 00:41:40.101
impregnable legal language
was not one of them.

891
00:41:40.201 --> 00:41:43.537
My brother may have
founded this clinic.

892
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:45.673
but it functions now
under my auspices.

893
00:41:50.344 --> 00:41:52.546
Shall we have a chat?

894
00:42:10.865 --> 00:42:12.433
<i>There it is.</i>

895
00:42:15.102 --> 00:42:17.671
The Rachel Carson Bridge.

896
00:42:17.772 --> 00:42:20.041
How's she looking these days?

897
00:42:24.745 --> 00:42:26.747
You know what? I agree.

898
00:42:27.715 --> 00:42:30.618
I couldn't see it
until you taught me to see it.

899
00:42:31.886 --> 00:42:34.488
But I do believe that is
the most beautiful thing

900
00:42:34.588 --> 00:42:35.756
in the world.

900
00:42:36.305 --> 00:43:36.437
