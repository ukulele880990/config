00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:19.251
I N T E R S T E L L A R

2
00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:23.203
My dad was a farmer.

3
00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.270
Like everybody else back then.

4
00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:31.125
Of course he didn't start that way.

5
00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:38.607
The computer says you're too tight.

6
00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:41.568
It is under control.
-Crossing the Straits.

7
00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:46.226
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
-Heyyy.

8
00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:50.279
Deleting all.
-Hey. we do not have to delete anything.

9
00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:55.339
Dad?

10
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:04.747
Sorry Murph. Go back to bed.

11
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.458
I thought you were the ghost.

12
00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:13.082
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
-Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

13
00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.854
No. I think it's because
grandpa is too close to...

14
00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.530
...being one himself. Go back to bed.

15
00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:21.577
Were you dreaming about the crash?

16
00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.465
Get your butt back in bed murph.

17
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:54.068
The wheat had died.

18
00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.224
The blight came and we had to burn it.
We still had corn.

19
00:02:58.304 --> 00:03:03.141
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

20
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.317
I guess I can't describe.
It was just constant.

21
00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:12.801
Just that. steady blow of dirt.

22
00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.245
We wore strips of sheet...

23
00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:22.312
...sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

24
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.216
Well when we set the table we always
set the plate upside down.

25
00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.938
Glasses or cups. whatever it was. upside down.

26
00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:40.494
Shake a leg. Murph. let's get a move on.
-One o'clock today. you and me in the barn.

27
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.146
Herbicide Resistance 101. check?
-Yes sir.

28
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:47.059
Not at the table Murph!

29
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:49.761
Dad. can you fix this?

30
00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:54.189
What the heck did you do to my lander?
-It wasn't me.

31
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.945
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
-It knocked it off my shelf.

32
00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.753
It's also knocking the books off.
-There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

33
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:03.030
Hey.
-I looked it up. it's called a poltergeist.

34
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.740
Dad. tell her.
-Well. that's not very scientific Murph.

35
00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:10.637
You said that science was about admitting what we don't know.
-She's got you there.

36
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.841
Hey. start looking after all our stuff.

37
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.580
Coop.

38
00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:20.373
Ok. Murph. you wanna talk science.

39
00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:24.846
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost.
No. you gotta go further.

40
00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.079
You have to record the facts. analyze...

41
00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:31.391
...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions.
Deal?

42
00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.765
Deal.
-All right.

43
00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:38.292
Have a good day at school.
-Hold up.

44
00:04:38.364 --> 00:04:42.636
Parent-Teacher conferences. parent.
not grandparent.

45
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.625
Slow down turbo.
That's not a dust storm.

46
00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:52.708
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
-Blight?

47
00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:57.364
They say it's the last harvest for okra.
Ever.

48
00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.147
He should have planted corn like the rest of us.
-Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.

49
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.603
She's single.
-Now what is that supposed to mean?

50
00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:09.977
Repopulating the Earth.
-Start pulling your weight young man.

51
00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:14.176
Why don't you start minding your own business?
-Old man.

52
00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:22.767
All right Murph give me second.

53
00:05:24.298 --> 00:05:27.771
Aha. third.

54
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:32.707
Find a gear dumbass.
-Grind it! -Shut up Tom!

55
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.504
Whatcha do Murph?
-Ahh. she didn't do nothing.

56
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:40.172
Blew a tire is all.
-Murphy's Law.
-Shut up!

57
00:05:40.253 --> 00:05:43.076
Grab the spare Tom.
-That is the spare.

58
00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:46.278
Get the patch kit.

59
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:49.895
And how am I supposed to patch it out here?

60
00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:53.372
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always
gonna be here to help you.

61
00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:03.767
What's goin' on Murph?

62
00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:08.567
Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad?
-No we didn't?

63
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:10.473
Murphy's Law?

64
00:06:11.847 --> 00:06:14.721
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...

65
00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:17.637
...will happen.
What it means is whatever can happen...

66
00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:21.346
...will happen.
And that sounded just fine with us.

67
00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:29.131
Get in.

68
00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:31.838
Get in. let's go.

69
00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:35.701
What about the flat tire?

70
00:06:38.347 --> 00:06:39.223
Yes.

71
00:06:53.437 --> 00:06:58.208
It is an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

72
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.221
Take the wheel Tom.

73
00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:07.366
Go. go go!

74
00:07:07.455 --> 00:07:09.075
Keep it pointed at that.

75
00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:20.007
Faster Tom. we're losing it.
-Yes.

76
00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:21.956
Point right at it.

77
00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.361
Hang on. here we go. here we go.

78
00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:37.405
Nice driving Tom.

79
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.280
Dad?
-Almost have it. don't stop. don't stop.

80
00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:51.332
Dad!
Tom!!!

81
00:07:56.112 --> 00:07:58.092
What? You told me to keep driving.

82
00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:03.566
Well I guess that answers the ol' 'if I ask you to
drive off a cliff' scenario.

83
00:08:06.344 --> 00:08:09.662
We lost it.
-No we didn't!

84
00:08:21.414 --> 00:08:24.010
Wanna give it a whirl?

85
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.400
Let's land it down there.
right at the edge of the reservoir.

86
00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.082
Nicely done!

87
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.975
How long do you think it's been up there?

88
00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:56.925
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours. 10 years ago.

89
00:08:58.299 --> 00:08:59.701
So for 10 years?

90
00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:05.354
Why did it come down so low?
-I don't know.

91
00:09:05.466 --> 00:09:09.604
Maybe the sun cooked it's brain
or it was looking for something.
-What?

92
00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:13.150
Give me that large flatblade
Maybe some kind of signal.

93
00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:14.441
I don't know.

94
00:09:19.532 --> 00:09:21.073
What are you gonna do with it?

95
00:09:21.153 --> 00:09:25.009
I'm gonna give it something socially
responsible to do...

96
00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:29.574
...like driving a combine.
-Can't we just. let it go?

97
00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:33.027
It wasn't hurting anybody.

98
00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:39.172
Listen. this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph.
like the rest of us.

99
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:46.989
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
-I've got class.

100
00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:49.554
This one. needs to wait.

101
00:09:49.627 --> 00:09:53.782
What did you do?

102
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:56.353
Well am I gonna be mad?
-Not with me.

103
00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:57.756
Just please. try not to.

104
00:09:57.872 --> 00:10:01.766
Relax. I got this.

105
00:10:06.253 --> 00:10:09.647
You're late Coop.
-Yeah. we had a flat.

106
00:10:09.717 --> 00:10:13.684
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

107
00:10:13.793 --> 00:10:17.034
No actually sir. that's. that's
a surveillance drone.

108
00:10:17.144 --> 00:10:20.947
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
-Take a seat.

109
00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:27.241
So. we got Tom's scores back.

110
00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:32.074
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
-Yeah he's got a knack for it.

111
00:10:32.183 --> 00:10:33.448
What about college?

112
00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:37.808
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

113
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.800
-I still pay my taxes.
Where does that money go? There's no more armies.

114
00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:44.802
Well. they don't go to the university.

115
00:10:45.924 --> 00:10:47.655
Look Coop. you have to be realistic.

116
00:10:47.766 --> 00:10:52.133
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

117
00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:56.788
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
-What's your waistline?

118
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.650
How about 32. 33 inseam?
-I'm not sure I see where you're getting at.

119
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.896
You're telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass...

120
00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:06.348
...but only one to measure my son's future?

121
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.058
Come on. you're a well-educated man Coop...

122
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.407
...and a trained pilot.
-And an engineer.

123
00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:17.264
Okay well right now. we don't need more engineers.

124
00:11:17.298 --> 00:11:22.341
We didn't run out of television screens or
planes; we ran out of food.

125
00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:26.813
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers like you. and Tom.

126
00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:31.652
Uneducated farmers.
-We are a caretaker generation Coop.

127
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:35.473
And things are getting better.
Maybe your grandkids will get to be...

128
00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:36.196
-Are we done here sir?

129
00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:41.678
No.
Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.

130
00:11:41.754 --> 00:11:46.655
Murph is a great kid. she's really bright.
But she's been having a bit of trouble lately.

131
00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:51.100
She brought this in to show the other students.
The section on the lunar landings.

132
00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:55.631
Yeah. it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

133
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:59.633
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

134
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.477
Corrected?
-Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...

135
00:12:04.512 --> 00:12:05.669
...the Soviet Union.

136
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.187
You don't believe we went to the Moon?

137
00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:18.693
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda
that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...

138
00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:22.328
...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.

139
00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:23.876
Useless machines?

140
00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:27.864
And if we don't want a repeat of the
excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...

141
00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:31.721
...then we need to teach our kids about this planet.
Not tales of leaving it.

142
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.421
Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make
was called an MRI.

143
00:12:36.531 --> 00:12:40.033
And if we had any of those left.
the doctors would've been able to find...

144
00:12:40.108 --> 00:12:44.064
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died; instead of afterwards.

145
00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:47.837
And then she would have been the one sitting here
listening to this instead of me...

146
00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:52.604
...which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

147
00:12:52.868 --> 00:12:55.851
I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.

148
00:12:56.039 --> 00:13:00.404
But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...

149
00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.809
...over this Apollo nonsense.

150
00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:05.955
So we thought it would be best to bring you in
and see what ideas you might have...

151
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.765
...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.

152
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:12.536
Yeah. you know what.
there's a game tomorrow night.

153
00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:16.419
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.
her favorite team is playing.

154
00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:18.089
There's gonna be candy and soda...

155
00:13:20.995 --> 00:13:23.976
...I think I'll take her to that.

156
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:32.980
How did it go?
-I got you suspended.

157
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.247
What??
-Cooper.

158
00:13:36.323 --> 00:13:40.925
This is Cooper. go.
-Coop. those combines you rebuilt went haywire.

159
00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:45.651
Just reset the controls.
-I did that. but you should come take a look.

160
00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:08.758
One by one they just teared off the fields
and headed over.

161
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.573
something's interfering with the compass.

162
00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:15.134
Magnetism. Or something such.

163
00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:02.003
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it. like you said.

164
00:15:02.073 --> 00:15:05.344
I counted the spaces.
-Why?

165
00:15:06.897 --> 00:15:11.834
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

166
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:16.624
Morse?
-Yeah. dots and dashes. It's...

167
00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:18.999
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

168
00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:21.222
...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.

169
00:15:32.678 --> 00:15:37.104
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset off the anomaly.

170
00:15:37.257 --> 00:15:40.015
Which is?
-I don't know.

171
00:15:41.632 --> 00:15:43.850
If the house had been built
on magnetic ore...

172
00:15:43.923 --> 00:15:46.730
...we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

173
00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:52.694
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

174
00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:59.182
You heard?
It's like we've forgotten who we are. Donald.

175
00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:04.145
Explorers. pioneers. not caretakers.

176
00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:10.882
When I was a kid. it felt like
they made something new everyday.

177
00:16:10.994 --> 00:16:14.121
Some gadget or idea.

178
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:18.875
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6 billion people.

179
00:16:18.946 --> 00:16:20.864
just try to imagine that.

180
00:16:21.432 --> 00:16:25.219
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

181
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.178
This world isn't so bad.

182
00:16:33.246 --> 00:16:36.548
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

183
00:16:36.623 --> 00:16:39.318
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

184
00:16:40.254 --> 00:16:42.779
My daughter knew it. God bless her.

185
00:16:44.112 --> 00:16:46.664
And your kids know it.
especially Murph.

186
00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:50.086
Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder

187
00:16:50.895 --> 00:16:53.483
at our place in the stars.

188
00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:57.774
Now we just look down.

189
00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.847
and worry about our place in the dirt.

190
00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:03.397
Cooper. you were good at something.

191
00:17:03.475 --> 00:17:07.071
and you never got a chance to do anything with it.

192
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.906
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:10.351 --> 00:17:14.320
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

194
00:17:14.402 --> 00:17:18.222
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

195
00:17:18.302 --> 00:17:23.212
In April I believe if I'm right.
15th of April I think.

196
00:17:23.247 --> 00:17:27.671
This just happened at 1:30 when that thing
came off the top of the canyon.

197
00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:33.025
In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?

198
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.835
Well in my day. people were too busy...

199
00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:38.247
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

200
00:17:38.282 --> 00:17:43.149
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

201
00:17:43.224 --> 00:17:45.567
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.

202
00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:49.679
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

203
00:17:49.792 --> 00:17:53.570
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

204
00:17:53.678 --> 00:17:58.320
Grandpa said huh?
Listen. all that matters is how you feel about it.

205
00:17:58.465 --> 00:18:02.573
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

206
00:18:02.723 --> 00:18:04.706
And you're gonna be great at it.

207
00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:19.134
Let's get outta here.

208
00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:31.138
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang. lets mask up.

209
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.255
Tom. Murph? -Check.
-Check?

210
00:19:29.986 --> 00:19:32.198
Murph. Tom. you guys shut your windows?

211
00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.543
Murph.

212
00:19:58.269 --> 00:20:03.117
The ghost.
-Grab your pillow.

213
00:20:03.226 --> 00:20:05.570
You're sleeping with Tom.

214
00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.336
It's not a ghost.

215
00:21:07.656 --> 00:21:08.990
It's gravity.

216
00:21:10.907 --> 00:21:13.483
I'm dropping Tom. then heading into town.

217
00:21:13.596 --> 00:21:17.917
You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.

218
00:21:43.327 --> 00:21:45.917
It's not Morse Murph. it's binary.

219
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:48.441
Thick is 1. thin is 0.

220
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.734
Coordinates.

221
00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:11.911
That's it.
-I can't miss this.

222
00:22:12.025 --> 00:22:14.572
Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.

223
00:22:15.664 --> 00:22:17.627
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

224
00:22:18.542 --> 00:22:23.542
And that. is why I can't take you.

225
00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:30.671
Murph.

226
00:22:31.798 --> 00:22:36.081
Grandpa will be home in a while. tell
him I'll call him on the radio.

227
00:22:43.236 --> 00:22:46.195
Jesus!
What are you doing?

228
00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:48.909
Oh do you think it's funny? Huh?

229
00:22:48.983 --> 00:22:51.814
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

230
00:22:53.794 --> 00:22:56.231
Make yourself useful.

231
00:23:59.203 --> 00:24:00.253
Hey Murph.

232
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.952
Murph.

233
00:24:06.628 --> 00:24:08.857
I think this is the end of the road.

234
00:24:11.264 --> 00:24:13.357
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

235
00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:16.604
That's my girl.

236
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.617
Step away from the fence.
-Don't shoot. don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

237
00:24:47.724 --> 00:24:48.981
My daughter is in the car.

238
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:56.223
Don't be afraid.

239
00:25:08.938 --> 00:25:13.150
How did you find this place?
-Where is my daughter?

240
00:25:13.264 --> 00:25:17.518
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
Where did you get those coordinates?

241
00:25:17.876 --> 00:25:21.378
Where is my daughter?
-Don't make me take you down again. sit down!

242
00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:24.434
Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?

243
00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:26.848
Marines don't exist. And you know what?

244
00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:30.662
I have got grunts like you mowing my grass.

245
00:25:30.736 --> 00:25:34.848
Where did you find those coordinates?
-Unless you want to end up as a lawnmower...

246
00:25:35.498 --> 00:25:39.721
...I think I'll turn you into a fabulous dry cleaner.
No you won't.

247
00:25:41.101 --> 00:25:43.686
TARS. back down please.

248
00:25:44.947 --> 00:25:48.018
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

249
00:25:48.136 --> 00:25:52.202
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

250
00:25:52.315 --> 00:25:54.219
It's what the government could spare.

251
00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.815
Who are you?
-Dr. Brand.

252
00:25:58.926 --> 00:26:03.785
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once. he was a Professor.
-What makes you think I'm not?

253
00:26:03.894 --> 00:26:05.494
Wasn't near as cute either.

254
00:26:05.609 --> 00:26:09.350
Please Dr. Brand. I don't have
any idea what this is.

255
00:26:09.463 --> 00:26:12.629
But I'm scared for my daughter.
and I want her by my side.

256
00:26:12.705 --> 00:26:15.228
You give me that. and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

257
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.797
Take the principal and the girl
to the conference room.

258
00:26:21.989 --> 00:26:25.849
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

259
00:26:25.927 --> 00:26:30.461
Must have a very smart mother.
-It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

260
00:26:30.573 --> 00:26:34.878
Why don't you let us back up from your fence
and we'll be on our way. huh?

261
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:37.801
It's not that simple.
-Well. sure it is.

262
00:26:37.913 --> 00:26:40.899
Look I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

263
00:26:41.008 --> 00:26:43.239
Yes you do.

264
00:26:48.097 --> 00:26:50.003
Dad!

265
00:26:52.934 --> 00:26:54.230
Hello Cooper.

266
00:26:55.492 --> 00:26:56.718
Professor Brand.

267
00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:00.684
Explain to me how you found this facility.

268
00:27:00.762 --> 00:27:04.220
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

269
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.851
You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.

270
00:27:06.922 --> 00:27:09.757
Nobody stumbles in here. nobody stumbles out.

271
00:27:10.639 --> 00:27:14.698
Cooper. please. cooperate with these people.

272
00:27:14.843 --> 00:27:19.013
Well. it's kinda hard to explain.

273
00:27:19.087 --> 00:27:23.122
We. we learnt these coordinates...

274
00:27:23.123 --> 00:27:25.763
...from an anomaly.
-What sort of anomaly?

275
00:27:25.874 --> 00:27:29.699
I hesitate to term it supernatural
but it wasn't scientific...

276
00:27:29.812 --> 00:27:34.650
You're gonna have to be specific
Mr. Cooper. right now.
-It was gravity.

277
00:27:39.605 --> 00:27:42.412
Um what sort of gravitational
an- where was this thing?

278
00:27:42.492 --> 00:27:45.908
Hey. I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity bud. but...

279
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:50.478
...you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.
-Assurances? -Yeah.

280
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.510
Like that we're getting out of here. and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

281
00:27:56.867 --> 00:28:01.349
Don't you know who we are Coop?
-No Professor. I don't.

282
00:28:01.457 --> 00:28:05.059
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

283
00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:09.079
NASA.
-NASA.

284
00:28:09.222 --> 00:28:11.744
The same NASA. you flew for.

285
00:28:21.134 --> 00:28:25.530
I heard they shut you down sir.
for refusing to drop bombs from...

286
00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:28.048
...the stratosphere on the starving people.

287
00:28:28.266 --> 00:28:30.764
When they realized that killing other people...

288
00:28:30.765 --> 00:28:35.299
...was not a long term solution.
they needed us back.
In secret.

289
00:28:35.411 --> 00:28:39.930
Why secret?
-Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

290
00:28:40.007 --> 00:28:42.765
Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.

291
00:28:42.874 --> 00:28:48.159
Blight. Wheat. seven years ago.

292
00:28:48.272 --> 00:28:51.434
Okra. this year.
-Now. there's just corn.

293
00:28:51.547 --> 00:28:54.145
And we're growing more than we ever had.

294
00:28:54.256 --> 00:28:58.605
Yeah. but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

295
00:28:58.714 --> 00:29:03.397
...the corn will die. Soon.

296
00:29:08.475 --> 00:29:12.262
We'll find a way. Professor. we always have.

297
00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:17.164
Driven by the unshakeable faith
that the Earth is ours.

298
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:19.296
Well not just ours. no.

299
00:29:20.564 --> 00:29:21.824
But it is our home.

300
00:29:21.935 --> 00:29:26.475
Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.

301
00:29:26.584 --> 00:29:28.515
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

302
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.241
Blight does. and as it thrives.
our air gets less and less oxygen.

303
00:29:33.349 --> 00:29:37.178
The last people to starve. will be the first to suffocate.

304
00:29:37.293 --> 00:29:39.577
And your daughter's generation...

305
00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:43.347
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

306
00:29:43.459 --> 00:29:47.421
Murph is feeling a little tired. and was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office?

307
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:48.952
Yeah. thank you.

308
00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:53.003
Okay.

309
00:29:53.147 --> 00:29:57.211
Now you need to tell me. what your plan is to save the world?

310
00:29:58.548 --> 00:30:02.169
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

311
00:30:07.613 --> 00:30:12.194
Rangers.
-The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.

312
00:30:12.274 --> 00:30:16.105
The Endurance.
Our final expedition.

313
00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:20.183
You sent people out there looking for a new home?

314
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:23.185
The Lazarus missions.
-Sounds cheerful!

315
00:30:23.292 --> 00:30:27.552
Lazarus came back from the dead.
-Sure. but he had to die in the first place.

316
00:30:27.662 --> 00:30:30.087
There's not a planet in our
solar system that could sustain...

317
00:30:30.088 --> 00:30:33.569
...life and the nearest
star is over a 1000 years away.

318
00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:35.703
I mean. it doesn't even qualify as futile.

319
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.135
Where did you send them?

320
00:30:39.206 --> 00:30:45.004
Cooper. I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

321
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.514
You're the best pilot we ever had.
-I barely left the stratosphere.

322
00:30:49.622 --> 00:30:51.925
This team never left the simulator.

323
00:30:51.998 --> 00:30:55.460
We need a pilot. and this is
the mission that you were trained for.

324
00:30:55.566 --> 00:30:57.544
What. without even knowing?

325
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.649
An hour ago. you didn't even know I was alive.
and you were going anyway.

326
00:31:02.831 --> 00:31:06.785
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

327
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.393
They chose you.
-Who's 'They'?

328
00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:21.213
How long. would I be gone?
-I don't know.

329
00:31:21.325 --> 00:31:25.232
Years.
-I've got kids Professor.

330
00:31:25.343 --> 00:31:28.505
Get out there and save them.

331
00:31:31.455 --> 00:31:35.190
Who's 'They'?
-We started detecting gravitational anomalies.

332
00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:37.044
almost 50 years ago.

333
00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:40.727
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

334
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.004
In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.

335
00:31:44.116 --> 00:31:46.411
Yeah. in the Straits.

336
00:31:46.524 --> 00:31:50.694
My crash. something tripped my fly-by-wire.

337
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:57.628
Exactly. But of all these anomalies.
the most significant is this.

338
00:31:57.774 --> 00:32:01.692
Out near Saturn.
A disturbance of spacetime.

339
00:32:03.252 --> 00:32:07.389
Is that a wormhole?
-It appeared 48 years ago.

340
00:32:07.539 --> 00:32:11.597
And it leads where?
-Another galaxy.

341
00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:16.060
A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.

342
00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:18.702
Someone placed it there.
-'They'?

343
00:32:19.962 --> 00:32:23.934
And whoever they are.
they appear to be looking out for us.

344
00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:27.179
That wormhole let's us
travel to other stars.

345
00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:29.452
It came right around when we needed it.

346
00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:32.688
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

347
00:32:32.832 --> 00:32:36.701
Twelve. in fact from our initial probes.
-You sent probes into that?

348
00:32:36.847 --> 00:32:40.381
We sent people into it. 10 years ago.

349
00:32:40.494 --> 00:32:43.044
The Lazarus missions.

350
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.784
12 possible worlds. 12 Ranger launches.

351
00:32:46.785 --> 00:32:50.129
Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.

352
00:32:50.307 --> 00:32:53.084
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

353
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.361
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

354
00:32:56.428 --> 00:32:58.015
But they could use hibernation to stretch that...

355
00:32:58.124 --> 00:33:02.120
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

356
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.529
Their mission was to assess their world and...

357
00:33:04.606 --> 00:33:08.310
...if it showed potential. then they could send
out a signal and bed down for the long nap...

358
00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:12.743
...wait to be rescued.
-And what if the world didn't show promise?

359
00:33:13.135 --> 00:33:14.789
Hence the bravery.

360
00:33:14.898 --> 00:33:19.120
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
-No.

361
00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:23.039
Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.

362
00:33:23.148 --> 00:33:26.030
Simple binary pings on an annual basis...

363
00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:30.823
...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
One system shows promise.

364
00:33:30.895 --> 00:33:33.192
Well one. that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?

365
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:36.796
One system with 3 potential worlds?

366
00:33:36.908 --> 00:33:38.695
Not a long shot.

367
00:33:41.109 --> 00:33:44.924
Wait.
So if we find a home...

368
00:33:48.606 --> 00:33:51.889
...then what?
-That's the long shot.

369
00:33:52.047 --> 00:33:55.246
There is a plan A. and a plan B.

370
00:33:55.358 --> 00:33:59.278
Did you notice anything
strange about the launch chamber?

371
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:13.465
This entire facility is a centrifuge.

372
00:34:13.612 --> 00:34:18.591
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
-Both. The plan A.

373
00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:20.214
How do you get it off the ground?

374
00:34:20.397 --> 00:34:24.637
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

375
00:34:24.784 --> 00:34:29.173
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity
was real.

376
00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:33.196
So I started working on a theory and we started...

377
00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:36.510
...building this station.
-But you haven't solved it yet.

378
00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:39.350
That's why there's a plan B.

379
00:34:39.534 --> 00:34:41.700
The problem is gravity.

380
00:34:41.847 --> 00:34:44.689
How to get a viable amount of human life
off the planet?

381
00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:48.871
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

382
00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:53.217
Over 5000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

383
00:34:54.701 --> 00:34:58.834
How would you raise 'em?
-With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.

384
00:34:58.995 --> 00:35:02.615
After that. with surrogacy
the growth becomes exponential.

385
00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:06.789
In 30 years. we could have
a colony of hundreds.

386
00:35:06.902 --> 00:35:10.983
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

387
00:35:11.018 --> 00:35:12.154
This will take care of that.

388
00:35:12.335 --> 00:35:17.047
Yeah. but what about the people here?
You just. you'd give up on them?

389
00:35:17.191 --> 00:35:22.165
My kids?
-That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

390
00:35:24.191 --> 00:35:27.747
How far have you got?
-Almost there.

391
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.768
You're asking me to hang everything...

392
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.387
...on an 'almost'.
-I'm asking you to trust me.

393
00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:40.497
Find us a new home.

394
00:35:40.645 --> 00:35:45.096
And by the time you return.
I would've solved the problem...

395
00:35:45.422 --> 00:35:48.650
...of gravity.
I give you my word.

396
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.621
Go away!

397
00:36:13.494 --> 00:36:17.697
Murph.
-Go. If you're leaving just go!

398
00:36:20.188 --> 00:36:24.352
This world was never enough for you.
was it Cooper?

399
00:36:24.437 --> 00:36:28.892
What. cause heading out there is what I feel like...
...what I was born to do?

400
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.883
And it excites me?

401
00:36:31.031 --> 00:36:35.352
Nah. it does not make it wrong.
-It might.

402
00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:39.295
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

403
00:36:39.744 --> 00:36:44.324
The 'why' of the thing. that's the foundation.
-And the foundation is solid.

404
00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:50.208
We farmers. we sit here every year when...

405
00:36:50.243 --> 00:36:54.171
...the rains fail. and we say:
Next year.

406
00:36:54.318 --> 00:36:58.380
Well. next year ain't gonna save us. nor the one after that.

407
00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:03.198
This world's a treasure Donald.
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

408
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:11.721
Mankind was born on Earth.
it was never meant to die here.

409
00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:19.387
Tom will be alright.
but you got to make things right with Murph.
-I will.

410
00:37:19.702 --> 00:37:23.442
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.

411
00:37:32.975 --> 00:37:35.889
You have to talk to me Murph.

412
00:37:37.397 --> 00:37:40.779
I need to fix this before I go.

413
00:37:40.936 --> 00:37:43.408
Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.

414
00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:50.513
After you kids came along. your mom. she
said something to me I never quite understood.

415
00:37:50.662 --> 00:37:55.407
She said: Now. we're just here...

416
00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:58.572
...to be the memories for our kids.

417
00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:06.170
I think I now understand what she meant.

418
00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:13.794
Once you're a parent. you become the
ghost of your children's future.

419
00:38:14.886 --> 00:38:17.700
You said ghosts didn't exist.

420
00:38:23.743 --> 00:38:25.469
That's right Murph.

421
00:38:28.025 --> 00:38:30.469
Look at me.

422
00:38:32.947 --> 00:38:35.486
I can't be your ghost right now.

423
00:38:37.213 --> 00:38:39.223
I need to exist.

424
00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:43.249
They chose me.

425
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.282
Murph. they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

426
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.779
And that's exactly why you can't go.

427
00:38:55.842 --> 00:39:00.819
I figured out the message.
One word. You know what it is?

428
00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:03.530
Murph.
-STAY.

429
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.954
It says STAY dad.
-Murph.

430
00:39:07.067 --> 00:39:11.868
You don't believe me!
Look at the books. It says STAY.

431
00:39:11.986 --> 00:39:16.380
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
-I'm coming back.

432
00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:18.610
When??

433
00:39:30.692 --> 00:39:34.480
One for you.
One for me.

434
00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:36.493
When I'm up there in hypersleep.

435
00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:40.216
or. or traveling at the speed of light.

436
00:39:40.403 --> 00:39:42.856
or. near a black hole.

437
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.306
Time is gonna change for me.

438
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:48.620
And it's gonna run more slowly.

439
00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:51.742
So. when we get back.

440
00:39:51.927 --> 00:39:56.575
we're gonna compare.
-Time will run differently for us?

441
00:39:56.688 --> 00:39:57.518
Yeah.

442
00:39:57.631 --> 00:40:01.769
Maybe by the time I get back.
you and I. we might be the same age.

443
00:40:01.918 --> 00:40:04.436
You and me.
What??

444
00:40:04.585 --> 00:40:06.024
Imagine that!

445
00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:13.731
Ah. Murph.
-You've no idea when you're coming back!!

446
00:40:15.217 --> 00:40:19.003
No idea at all!
-Murph.

447
00:40:20.297 --> 00:40:24.324
Murph. don't. don't make me leave like this.
Murph!

448
00:40:24.506 --> 00:40:27.100
Don't make me leave like this Murph!!

449
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.882
I love you.

450
00:40:38.065 --> 00:40:41.895
You hear me?
I love you forever.

451
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.407
And I'm coming back.

452
00:40:49.423 --> 00:40:50.905
I'm coming back.

453
00:41:08.627 --> 00:41:11.370
How did it go?
-Well.

454
00:41:11.485 --> 00:41:12.921
Very well.

455
00:41:20.839 --> 00:41:25.779
I love you Tom. -Travel safe. okay?
-Yes. Take care of this place for me. OK?

456
00:41:25.892 --> 00:41:29.146
OK?
-Ok.

457
00:41:32.138 --> 00:41:35.527
Hey. can I use your truck while you're gone?
-You mean your truck?

458
00:41:37.113 --> 00:41:39.090
I'll make sure they bring it back.

459
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.661
Look after my kids Donald.

460
00:41:55.617 --> 00:41:59.282
Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.

461
00:41:59.744 --> 00:42:03.993
Dad!
-9 -Dad!!

462
00:42:04.028 --> 00:42:08.467
8. 7.
-DAD!!!

463
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:13.815
6. 5.
Main engines start.

464
00:42:13.928 --> 00:42:22.781
4. 3. 2. 1. Booster ignition. and.

465
00:42:30.885 --> 00:42:33.511
All engines are good.
Beginning roll program.

466
00:42:36.247 --> 00:42:41.064
Prepare for stage one separation.

467
00:42:41.217 --> 00:42:43.006
Stage one.

468
00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:54.199
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

469
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.768
They gave him a humor setting.
to fit in better with his unit.

470
00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:04.460
He thinks it relaxes us.
-A giant sarcastic robot.

471
00:43:05.798 --> 00:43:09.791
What a great idea!
-I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking. would you like?

472
00:43:09.826 --> 00:43:11.025
That wouldn't be a problem.

473
00:43:11.135 --> 00:43:15.230
It will help you get back to the
ship. when I blow you out of the air lock.

474
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:18.270
What's your humor setting TARS?

475
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.276
100% -Let's bring it down to 75 please.

476
00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:24.229
Stage two separation.

477
00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:37.519
All feeds going manual.
-Going manual.

478
00:43:39.789 --> 00:43:43.644
Deactivate probe heater 1. 2 and 3.
-Check.

479
00:43:47.204 --> 00:43:52.100
Taking control.
-This is handover to you.

480
00:43:55.205 --> 00:43:57.683
ADF check. Over.

481
00:43:57.834 --> 00:44:02.378
Back thrusters. Fuel cells 1. 2. 3.

482
00:44:02.413 --> 00:44:06.049
100%
ex-mites.

483
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.837
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

484
00:44:17.985 --> 00:44:21.921
Your father.
-We're gonna be spending a lot of time together.

485
00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:25.601
-We should learn to talk.
-And when not to.

486
00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:31.478
Just being honest.
-Well you don't need to be that honest.

487
00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:36.010
Hey TARS. what's your honesty parameter?
-90%

488
00:44:36.155 --> 00:44:37.633
90%?

489
00:44:37.745 --> 00:44:41.273
Absolute honesty
isn't always the most diplomatic...

490
00:44:41.391 --> 00:44:45.022
...nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings.
-Okay!

491
00:44:45.132 --> 00:44:47.478
90% it is Dr. Brand.

492
00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:54.532
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

493
00:45:11.338 --> 00:45:13.605
Okay taking control.

494
00:45:16.888 --> 00:45:19.836
Approaching module port. 500 meters.

495
00:45:32.747 --> 00:45:34.655
It's all you Doyle.

496
00:45:52.023 --> 00:45:55.691
Nice and easy Doyle. nice and easy.

497
00:45:59.661 --> 00:46:03.481
Take us home.

498
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.815
Target locked.

499
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:15.379
Target locked.
Okay. helmets on.

500
00:46:15.535 --> 00:46:16.433
Good job.

501
00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:52.799
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

502
00:47:15.842 --> 00:47:19.342
Cooper. you should have control.
-Control here.

503
00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:23.062
Communication with ring module active.

504
00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:38.652
That's initiate.

505
00:47:46.213 --> 00:47:48.410
Ready to spin?
-Just a sec.

506
00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:02.410
Hello CASE.
-Hello TARS.

507
00:48:03.132 --> 00:48:06.804
Okay. we're all set.
-All right let's do it.

508
00:48:36.498 --> 00:48:38.048
30% of spin.

509
00:48:43.814 --> 00:48:45.466
One g.

510
00:48:46.626 --> 00:48:50.227
How is gravity treating you back there?

511
00:48:53.173 --> 00:48:57.143
Romilly. hey you okay?
-Yeah. -You all right?

512
00:48:57.254 --> 00:48:58.126
Yeah. no I just need a minute.

513
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.307
Okay. I think we have some dramamine
in the hibe pad. I'll just go and get that.

514
00:49:02.419 --> 00:49:05.690
It'll be in the cryo pack.
Just give me a sec. -Hey Brand?

515
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:07.321
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

516
00:49:15.771 --> 00:49:19.439
Amelia. be safe.

517
00:49:19.592 --> 00:49:23.720
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
-I will Dad.

518
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:28.791
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated. two years to Saturn.

519
00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:30.711
That's a lot of Dramamine.

520
00:49:31.865 --> 00:49:33.880
Look after my family will you please. sir?

521
00:49:34.023 --> 00:49:37.260
We'll be waiting for you. when you get back.

522
00:49:37.801 --> 00:49:42.333
A little older. a little wiser.
but happy to see you.

523
00:49:44.316 --> 00:49:47.771
'Do not go gentle into that good night.'

524
00:49:47.962 --> 00:49:52.664
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day.'

525
00:49:53.963 --> 00:49:58.567
'Rage. rage against the dying of the light.'

526
00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:03.809
'Though wise men at their end.
know dark is right.'

527
00:50:03.955 --> 00:50:06.829
'Because their words had forked no lightning they'

528
00:50:07.013 --> 00:50:10.384
'Do not go gentle. into that good night'

529
00:50:10.966 --> 00:50:15.710
'Rage. rage against the dying of the light.'

530
00:50:39.361 --> 00:50:41.085
Here. pills.

531
00:50:43.896 --> 00:50:48.028
So alone.
-We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

532
00:50:48.137 --> 00:50:49.436
I mean them.

533
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:55.050
It's a perfect planet and we're
not gonna find another one like it.

534
00:50:55.228 --> 00:50:59.579
No. it's not like. looking for a new condo.

535
00:50:59.729 --> 00:51:03.803
The human race is going to be. adrift.

536
00:51:03.949 --> 00:51:07.876
Desperate for a rock they can cling to before
running out of breath.

537
00:51:07.911 --> 00:51:09.569
We have to find that rock.

538
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:14.698
and our 3 prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain human life.

539
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:19.902
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

540
00:51:25.294 --> 00:51:28.395
Wolf Edmonds is here.
-Tell me about Edmonds.

541
00:51:29.436 --> 00:51:31.844
Oh. um. Wolf's a particle physicist.

542
00:51:34.441 --> 00:51:36.206
Did any of them had families?

543
00:51:37.614 --> 00:51:40.515
No. no attachments. My father insisted.

544
00:51:40.704 --> 00:51:43.327
Everyone knew the possibility of...

545
00:51:43.402 --> 00:51:46.330
...ever seeing another human being.
I hope we can surprise at least 3 of them.

546
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.741
Dr. Mann?
-Dr. Mann. well. he's remarkable.  He's the best of us.

547
00:51:50.921 --> 00:51:53.804
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

548
00:51:53.889 --> 00:51:55.836
...in human history.

549
00:51:55.871 --> 00:51:58.238
Scientists. explorers.
That's what I love.

550
00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:01.404
Y'know out there. we would face great odds.

551
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.745
Death. But. not evil.

552
00:52:05.892 --> 00:52:08.228
You don't think nature can be evil?

553
00:52:08.373 --> 00:52:13.193
No. Formiable. frightening. But. no. not evil.

554
00:52:14.608 --> 00:52:18.495
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

555
00:52:18.647 --> 00:52:20.481
Just what we take with us then?

556
00:52:21.318 --> 00:52:25.349
Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.

557
00:52:25.495 --> 00:52:28.532
Even me. huh?
-Y'know what? We agreed. 90%.

558
00:52:28.675 --> 00:52:30.842
Don't stay up.

559
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:32.114
I'll be in a minute.

560
00:52:32.273 --> 00:52:36.418
Just remember Coop. you're literally wasting your breath.

561
00:52:42.833 --> 00:52:45.962
Hey TARS. let's go over that trajectory one more time.

562
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.886
8 months to Mars.
Gravitational slingshot around.

563
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.345
14 months to Saturn.
Nothing has changed on that.

564
00:52:53.493 --> 00:52:54.970
Let me ask you something.

565
00:52:57.454 --> 00:53:00.692
Dr. Brand and Edmonds.
-Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

566
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.540
Dr. Brand and Edmonds. they close?
-I wouldn't know.

567
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.610
Is that '90% wouldn't know' or '10% wouldn't know'?

568
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.810
I also have a discretion setting Cooper.

569
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:22.170
But not a poker-face slick.

570
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.960
Hey guys.

571
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.780
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

572
00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.730
and I just. wanted to give you an update.

573
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.740
The Earth looks amazing from here.

574
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:50.030
You can't see any of the dust.

575
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.430
I really hope you guys are doin'. doin' great.

576
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:57.320
I know you're gonna get this message.

577
00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:01.850
Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you.

578
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.460
Is it him?
-Don't think so Murph.

579
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.430
You must be Donald.

580
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.310
Hello Murph.
-Why are you in my dad's truck?

581
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.120
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

582
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.900
He sent you a message.

583
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:31.270
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

584
00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.800
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

585
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:43.300
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe I should fan the flame.

586
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:47.970
She's already making fools of her teachers.
well. maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.

587
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:52.510
So where are they?
-Heading for Mars.

588
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:57.010
The next time you hear from Cooper.
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

589
00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:40.370
They want me to repeat plant pathology.

590
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:45.950
It sucks. But. they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

591
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.880
So...alright.
Well. I gotta go Dad.

592
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.140
Hope you're safe up there.

593
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:59.000
Sorry Coop. I asked Murph to say hi.

594
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:04.010
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

595
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.680
Are you okay Rom?

596
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:26.600
This gets to me Cooper.
This. this.

597
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.200
Millimeters of aluminum protecting us
and then nothing...

598
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.050
...out there for millions of miles. won't kill us in seconds.

599
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:40.040
Did you know that some of
the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...

600
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.740
...don't know how to swim?
They don't know. and if they go overboard. it's done.

601
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.570
We are explorers Rom.

602
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:53.130
This is our boat.
Here.

603
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.930
This is the. relay probe?
-In orbit around the wormhole.

604
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.560
This is the wormhole and every
time we come around...

605
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.410
...we would receive images from
the other side of the foreign galaxy.

606
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.010
Like swinging a periscope around.
-Exactly.

607
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.030
so we got a pretty good idea.
what we're gonna find on the other side. huh?

608
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.980
Navigationally.

609
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.700
Hey guys. looks like we're gonna be
approaching the wormhole in three hours.

610
00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.720
Hey Coop. can we stop the spinning?

611
00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:00.790
Why? -Because we are close enough to see it.

612
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.970
Aha.

613
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:13.400
Look. that's. that's it. That's the wormhole.

614
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.470
Say it. don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

615
00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:20.170
Well of course it is.
What you thought it would just be a hole?

616
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.100
No. It's just that all the illustrations I've seen they...

617
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:29.110
The illustrations. try to show how it works.

618
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:33.430
So they say you want to go from here. to there.

619
00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:35.070
But this is too far.

620
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.880
So a wormhole bends space like this so you...

621
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:42.500
...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.

622
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:47.410
Okay so. to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space...

623
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.780
...into 2 dimensions. which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

624
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.950
...a circle.
What's a circle in 3 dimensions?

625
00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:59.310
A sphere.
-Exactly. A spherical hole.

626
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:03.430
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

627
00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:08.370
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get outta here in one piece Rom.

628
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:16.790
Any trick to this Doyle?

629
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.530
No one knows.

630
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:28.810
The others made it. right?

631
00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.630
At least some.

632
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:07.490
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?

633
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:10.220
To our galaxy.

634
01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:13.470
Here we go.

635
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:49.150
Controls won't work here.
We are passing through the bulk.

636
01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:54.090
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions.
All you can do is report and observe.

637
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.530
What is that?

638
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.590
I think it's 'Them'.
-Distorting spacetime?

639
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.270
Don't. Don't!

640
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.860
What was that?

641
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:49.370
First handshake.

642
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.320
We're...

643
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.730
We're here.

644
01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.910
So the lost communications came through.
-How?

645
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.980
The relay on this side cached them.
Years of basic data. no surprises there.

646
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.480
Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up'.
as has Dr. Mann's.

647
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:33.310
Edmonds went down three years ago.
-Transmitter failure?

648
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.310
Maybe.
He was sending the thumbs up until it went dark.

649
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.070
But Miller's still looks good though. right?
Because she's coming up fast.

650
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.420
But there's one complication.

651
01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.570
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

652
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.770
Gargantua?
-It's what we're calling the black hole.

653
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.960
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

654
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.190
And Miller's is on the horizon?
-Like a basketball around a hoop.

655
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.910
Landing there takes us dangerously close...

656
01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:01.180
...and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

657
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:06.820
Maybe I. I could swing around the neutron star...

658
01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.480
-No no no. it's not that. it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

659
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:12.920
...slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

660
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.680
Well how bad?

661
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:21.590
Well. every hour we spend on that planet
will be. huh. seven years back on Earth.

662
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.800
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

663
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:30.200
Well. we can't just drop down there without...
-Cooper...

664
01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:32.790
We have a mission.
-Yeah Doyle. we have a mission.

665
01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:35.430
And our mission. Plan A is to find a planet...

666
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:37.970
...that can habitate the people
that are living on the Earth right now.

667
01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.710
You can't just think about your family.
now you have to think bigger than that. alright?

668
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.800
I'm thinking about my family
and millions of other families.

669
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:48.810
Okay. Plan A does not work. if the people
on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

670
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.050
No. it doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

671
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:59.220
Okay. Cooper's right.
We have to think about time as a resource just like...

672
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:01.670
...oxygen and food.
Going down there is gonna cost us.

673
01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:08.040
Okay look. Dr. Mann's data is promising. alright.

674
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:11.670
but it's gonna take us months to get there.
and Edmonds. it's even further.

675
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.230
Now Miller hasn't said much.
But what she has said is very promising.

676
01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:17.140
It's water. it's organics.
-You don't find that everyday.

677
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:20.660
No. you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

678
01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.030
...that would be spent trying to get back here.

679
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.140
Romilly.
-Yeah.

680
01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.590
How far off of Miller's planet
will we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

681
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.870
Well. just back from the cusp.
-Which is here. just outside of Miller's planet.

682
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:37.420
Alright. Okay.

683
01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.810
This is Gargantua. here's Miller's planet.

684
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:44.590
Instead of taking the Endurance
in orbit around Miller's planet. which would...

685
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.440
...conserve fuel. but we'd lose a lot of time.

686
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:52.010
what if. what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua.
parallel with Miller's planet.

687
01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.540
outside of it's time shift. to here.
Then we take the Ranger down.

688
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.560
we get Miller. we get her samples.
we come back. we analyze. we debrief...

689
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.420
...we're in. we're out. we lose a little fuel.
But we save a lot of time.

690
01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:04.440
That'll work.
-That's good. -There's not gonna...

691
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:08.340
be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there.
so TARS. you should definitely stay here.

692
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:12.130
CASE. you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

693
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.590
If we are talking about a couple of years.

694
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.860
I could use the time to research gravity.

695
01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:19.490
observations from the wormhole.
that's gold to Professor Brand.

696
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.900
TARS. factor an orbit around Gargantua.
conserve fuel. minimize thrusting.

697
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.420
Make sure we stay in range
from Miller's planet. You got it?

698
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:29.750
I wouldn't leave you behind. Dr. Brand.

699
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:38.100
You ready CASE? -Yep.
-You don't say much do you?

700
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:43.000
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
-Detach.

701
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.180
Romilly. are you reading these forces?
-It's unbelievable.

702
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:58.620
A literal heart of darkness.

703
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.770
If we could just see the collapsed star inside.

704
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.790
the singularity. we'd solve gravity.

705
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:12.260
We can't get anything from it?
-Nothing escapes that horizon.

706
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:16.310
not even light.
All the answers are there. just no way to see it.

707
01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.820
There's Miller's planet.

708
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:21.350
Goodbye Ranger.

709
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:38.540
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

710
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.710
-No.
I'll use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.

711
01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:45.840
Air-brake?
-We wanna get down fast don't we?

712
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:49.350
Actually we wanna get there in one piece.
-Hang on.

713
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.110
Brand. Doyle. get ready.

714
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.670
We should be using the air-brake.
-Hands up CASE.

715
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:13.170
The only time I've gone down is
when the machine was easing at the wrong time.

716
01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:16.400
You're gonna get us killed.
-Just like reckless driving.

717
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.320
We're too fast. -I got this.

718
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:27.120
Should I get ready to detach?
-No. I need to feel the air.

719
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.320
Here we go.

720
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:36.570
It's just water.

721
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:41.430
The stuff of life.
-1200 meters.

722
01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:44.620
Have we located the beacon?
-That I have. can you maneuver?

723
01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:49.530
I'm gonna spiral down. everybody hang on.

724
01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.850
700.

725
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.150
On my cue CASE. on my cue.

726
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.420
500 meters.

727
01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.050
Now!

728
01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:27.380
Very graceful.

729
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:31.870
No. but very efficient.

730
01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:36.080
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

731
01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:39.860
Go. go. go. go.
7 years per hour here.

732
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.260
Let's make it count.

733
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.330
This way.

734
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.050
About 200 meters.

735
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.660
Gravity's punishing.
-Been floating through space too long?

736
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:30.070
130% Earth's gravity.

737
01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:32.830
Come on. come on. come on.

738
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:37.400
There's nothing here.
-should be right here.

739
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:42.530
If the. if the signal's coming from here. then...

740
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:53.120
Her beacon.

741
01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.360
Wreckage.
-Where's the rest?

742
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.160
Towards the mountains.

743
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.530
Those aren't mountains.

744
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.390
They're waves.
-What?

745
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:21.370
Shit.

746
01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.580
That one's moving away from us.

747
01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.430
We need the recorder.

748
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.320
Brand. Doyle. back to the Ranger now!

749
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.670
I'm not. leaving. without. her data.

750
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:54.270
Get back here now. There is no time.
The second wave is coming.

751
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:56.860
We are in the middle of a swell.

752
01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:00.750
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

753
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.590
Brand get back here now!!

754
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.930
Cooper. go. Cooper go. I can't make it. Go!

755
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.270
CASE. go get her.

756
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.630
GO!
-Get up. get up Brand.

757
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.490
Go go. go.

758
01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.350
I'm not gonna make it!
-Yes you are. Yes you are!

759
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:37.570
Come on CASE has her. Doyle get back here.

760
01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.820
Dr. Brand.

761
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:45.270
To the hatch.

762
01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.300
Go. go. Go.

763
01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.860
Manually overriding inside hatch!

764
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.910
Cooper don't!
Cooper don't!

765
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.150
Cooper!

766
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.840
Engines are flooded!
I'll have to shut it down!

767
01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.640
Oh shit!!

768
01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.760
Whoaa!

769
01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:31.060
CASE what's wrong?
-Engine's waterlogged. let it drain.

770
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:35.450
Goddamn it!!
I told you to leave me.

771
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.970
-And I told you to get your ass back here!

772
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.660
The difference is that one of
us was thinkin' about the mission.

773
01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:43.610
-You were thinking about getting home!!

774
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:49.610
I was trying to do the right thing!
-Can you tell that to Doyle?

775
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:54.500
CASE. how much time?
-45 to an hour.

776
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:57.620
The stuff of life huh?

777
01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:01.610
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
-A lot.

778
01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:03.300
Decades.

779
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.380
What happened to Miller?
-Judging by...

780
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:17.300
...the wreckage she was
broken up by waves soon after impact.

781
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:20.870
How's the hell the wreckage stayed together
after all these years. huh?

782
01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.720
Because of the time slippage.

783
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.490
On this planet's time she.

784
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.620
she's landed hours ago. she...

785
01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.650
...she probably just died minutes ago.

786
01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.600
The data Doyle received was just the initial
status echoing endlessly.

787
01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.090
Oh we are not prepared for this.

788
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.780
You eggheads've got the survival skills
of a boy-scout troop.

789
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:48.900
Well we got this far on our brains.
farther than any human in history.

790
01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:53.570
Well not far enough.
And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...

791
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:54.760
...left on Earth to save.

792
01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.240
I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.

793
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:08.870
Is there any possibility?
I dunno. maybe some way. maybe we...

794
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:13.000
...could jump in a black hole
and gain back the years?

795
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.850
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative. okay.

796
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.210
It can stretch and it can squeeze. but.

797
01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.030
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

798
01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:27.300
The only thing that can move across dimensions.
like time. is gravity.

799
01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:30.930
Okay.

800
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.500
The beings that led us here.

801
01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:38.710
they communicate through gravity. right?

802
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.780
Could they be talking to us from the future?
-Maybe.

803
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:46.400
Okay. if they can..?
They...

804
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:49.170
...are beings of 5 dimensions!

805
01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.900
Right. to them. time might be
another physical dimension.

806
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:57.530
To them. the past might be a canyon
they can climb into.

807
01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:02.360
and the future. a mountain that they can climb up.
but to us. it's not! Okay!

808
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:06.370
Look Cooper. I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

809
01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:09.720
But you knew about relativity.

810
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:13.500
Brand.

811
01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.580
My daughter is 10 years old.

812
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.960
Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left.

813
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:28.640
You couldn't have told your daughter
that you were going to save the world?
-No.

814
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.470
When you become a parent.
one thing becomes really clear.

815
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.270
And that's you want your children to feel safe.

816
01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:44.100
and it rules out telling a 10 year old.
that the world's endin'.

817
01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:47.420
Cooper.

818
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.540
How long for the engines CASE?
-A minute or two.

819
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.790
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!!

820
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:05.280
Brand. co-pilot you're up.
CASE. run the cabin's oxygen through the main thrusters.

821
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.340
We're gonna spark it!
-Roger that.

822
01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:08.650
Depressurizing.

823
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.170
Engines up!

824
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.080
Hello Rom!
-I've waited years.

825
01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:50.800
How many. how many years?

826
01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.410
By now it must be.
23 years. 4 months. 8 days.

827
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.460
Doyle?

828
01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.910
I thought I was prepared...I knew the theory...

829
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.500
...reality is different.

830
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:17.370
And Miller?

831
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:20.540
There's nothing here for us.

832
01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:28.070
Why didn't you sleep?
-Oh I had a couple of stretches.

833
01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:31.030
I stopped believing that you were coming back.

834
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:33.950
Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.

835
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:37.010
I learned what I could from the black hole

836
01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.480
but I couldn't send anything to your father.

837
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.370
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
-Is he alive?

838
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:47.410
Oh. yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.

839
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.340
We've got years of messages stored.
-Cooper.

840
01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:57.800
Messages span 23 years.

841
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.350
Play from the beginning.

842
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:09.550
Hey Dad.
Just checkin' in. sayin' hi.

843
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:14.190
Umm. I finished 2nd in school.

844
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.900
Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though.

845
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:21.210
pulled me down.
but second's not bad.

846
01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.630
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

847
01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:30.700
Umm. oh. I met another girl dad.

848
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:35.760
I uh. I really think this is the one.

849
01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.900
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

850
01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.190
Murphy stole grandpa's car.

851
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.970
She crashed it. she's okay though.

852
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.830
Hey Dad.
Look at this!

853
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:57.270
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

854
01:19:57.370 --> 01:20:02.520
I wanted to go with Coop. but
Lois says maybe next time.

855
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:05.100
And Doanld says he's already got the 'great' part so.

856
01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:07.630
we're not to call him that.

857
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:14.750
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

858
01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:17.810
Goodbye grandpa.

859
01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:19.720
Sorry. it's been a while.

860
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:27.010
It's.... what with Jesse and all...

861
01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:35.770
Uhh. grandpa died last week.

862
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.540
We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom...

863
01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.110
...and Jesse.

864
01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:47.010
Which is where we would've buried you.
if you would ever have come back.

865
01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.460
Murph was there at the funeral.

866
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:54.130
We don't see her that much. but she came for that.

867
01:20:57.350 --> 01:21:00.060
You're not listening to this. I know.

868
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:08.600
All these messages are just. ... drifting...

869
01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:10.970
out there in the darkness.

870
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:17.170
Lois says that. uh... I have to let you go.

871
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.370
And uh...

872
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.520
...so...

873
01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.020
I guess... I'll let you go.

874
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:31.260
I don't know where you're dad.

875
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:34.940
But I hope that you're at peace. And...

876
01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:37.550
Goodbye.

877
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:52.220
Hey Dad.

878
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.200
Hey Murph.
-You son of a bitch!

879
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:04.890
I never made one of these when you were still responding.

880
01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.770
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

881
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:12.010
And then when you went quiet.

882
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:17.940
it felt like I should've lived with that decision.
and I have.

883
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:24.520
but today is my birthday.

884
01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:31.560
And it's a special one.
because you told me.

885
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:37.840
you once told me that when you come back...

886
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.860
...we might be the same age.

887
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.750
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

888
01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.010
So it would be a real good time for youto come back!

889
01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:05.660
I didn't mean to intrude.

890
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:10.740
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
-Because I've never been in here before.

891
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.580
I talk to Amelia. all the time.
It helps.

892
01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:21.800
I'm glad you've started.
-I haven't.

893
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:26.280
Just had something which needed to get out.
-I know they're still out there.

894
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.680
I know.

895
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.640
There are many reasons why our communications
might not be getting through.

896
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.940
I know Professor.

897
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:37.090
I'm not sure. what I'm more afraid of.

898
01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.200
Them never coming back or...

899
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:44.350
...coming back to find we've failed.

900
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.860
Then let's succeed.
-So.

901
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.860
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

902
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:56.550
With respect Professor. we've tried that
hundreds of times.

903
01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:00.180
-It only has to work once. Murph.

904
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:06.840
Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.

905
01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.990
We've done well. in the world here.

906
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:14.150
whether or not we crack the equation.
before I kick the bucket.

907
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.930
Don't be morbid Professor.
-I'm not afraid of death.

908
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.810
I am an old physicist.

909
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.090
I'm afraid of time.

910
01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:31.430
Time.

911
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:35.440
You're afraid of time.

912
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.460
For years we've been trying
to solve the equation without changing...

913
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.130
...the underlying assumption about time.
-And?

914
01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:47.250
What it means. is each iteration
is an attempt to prove it's own proof.

915
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:51.200
it's recursive....it's nonsensical.

916
01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.040
Are you calling my life's work nonsense. Murph?

917
01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.370
No. I'm saying that you've been trying
to finish it with one arm...

918
01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:03.190
...no. with both arms tied behind your back.

919
01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:06.210
And I don't understand why.

920
01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.110
I am an old man Murph.

921
01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.750
Can we take this point up another time?

922
01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.910
I want to talk to my daughter.

923
01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.810
Stepping out into the universe.

924
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:24.050
we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

925
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.290
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.

926
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:32.300
We must think. not as individuals.

927
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:34.610
but as a species.

928
01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:40.930
'Do not go gentle into that good night.'

929
01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.580
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed it...

930
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:47.390
...but the trip took longer than we anticipated.

931
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.330
We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects.

932
01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:52.990
so. we've to choose.

933
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.220
But how?

934
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:58.070
They're both promising.

935
01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:01.760
And Edmonds data is better.

936
01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:04.550
but Dr. Mann is the one still transmitting. So...

937
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.470
We've got no reason to suspect Edmonds data would've soured.

938
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:12.800
His world has key elements to sustain human life.
-As does Dr. Mann's.

939
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:14.240
Cooper. this is my field.

940
01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:20.240
And I really believe Edmond's is the better prospect.
-Why?

941
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:25.350
Gargantua. that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

942
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:29.650
Hydrocarbons. organics. yes;
But no life. Sterile.

943
01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.510
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
-Because of the black hole?

944
01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:38.080
-Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen. will happen.

945
01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:40.860
Accidents are the first building block of evolution.

946
01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:44.390
but when you're orbiting a black hole.
not enough can happen.

947
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:48.370
it sucks in asteroids. comets.
other events which would otherwise reach you.

948
01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.760
We need to go further afield.

949
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:56.300
You once said that Dr. Mann. was the best of us.

950
01:26:56.410 --> 01:27:00.050
He is remarkable.
we're only here because of him.

951
01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.440
And. and yet here he is.
he is on the ground.

952
01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:08.200
and he's sending a very unambiguous message.
telling us to come to his planet.

953
01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:13.950
-Granted.
But Edmond's data is more promising.

954
01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:17.830
-We should vote.
-Well. if we're gonna vote. there's something you should know.

955
01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.440
Brand. he has a right to know.

956
01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.950
That has nothing to do with it.
-What does?

957
01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.210
She's in love with Wolf Edmonds.
-Is that true?

958
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.540
Yes.

959
01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:35.460
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

960
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:42.670
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure this out with theory.

961
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:45.880
-You're a scientist Brand.
-So listen to me.

962
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:50.640
When I say that love isn't
something we invented. it's...

963
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.310
...observable. powerful.

964
01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:00.930
It has to mean something.
-Love has meaning. yes. social utility...

965
01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:04.520
...social bonding. child rearing.
-We love people who have died.

966
01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:08.560
where's the social utility in that?
-None.

967
01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:11.470
-Maybe it means something more.
something we can't...

968
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.560
...yet understand.

969
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:17.970
Maybe it's. some evidence. some...

970
01:28:18.850 --> 01:28:23.620
...artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive.

971
01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.650
I'm drawn across the universe to someone...

972
01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:31.350
...I haven't seen in a decade.
Who. I know. is probably dead.

973
01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.480
Love is the one thing we're capable...

974
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:37.770
...of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

975
01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.100
Maybe we should trust that.

976
01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:45.110
even if we can't understand it yet.

977
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:50.820
Alright Cooper.

978
01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:54.170
Yes!

979
01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.890
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

980
01:28:59.110 --> 01:29:03.840
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
-Honestly Amelia.

981
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:07.120
it might.

982
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.610
TARS. chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

983
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:41.890
We'll lose about a third again. Next year.
Next year. I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and make it up.

984
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.910
What happened to Nelson?

985
01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:54.600
Murph. can I get you anything?
Would you like some more Soufflé?
-No. I'm full. Thanks.

986
01:29:54.710 --> 01:29:55.580
It was delicious.

987
01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.420
Hand me that donut please.

988
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:04.990
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...

989
01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.370
-I need to get back.
-My sewing machine is in there. but there's...

990
01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.450
-I need to...

991
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:17.030
...too many memories.
-Well. we have something for that.

992
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:28.410
Dust.

993
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:33.310
Lois. I have a friend who could...

994
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.580
...look at his lungs.

995
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:56.760
Amelia. I'm sorry.
-You're just being objective.

996
01:30:56.830 --> 01:31:00.030
Unless you're punishing me.
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

997
01:31:00.230 --> 01:31:02.230
-No. this wasn't a personal decision.

998
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:06.770
Well. if you're wrong. you have
a very personal decision to make.

999
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.910
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1000
01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:13.960
Strike out Mann's planet and you'll
have to decide whether...

1001
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:17.520
...to return home. or push onto Edmonds with plan B.

1002
01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:21.490
Creating a colony could save us from extinction.

1003
01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:24.350
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

1004
01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.400
...or the future of the human race.

1005
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:29.470
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1006
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:38.890
He has been asking for you since he came to.

1007
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:40.270
We were trying to reach you.

1008
01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.650
Murph?
-Hey.
I'm here Professor.

1009
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.140
I think I let all down.

1010
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:56.320
No. you got us this far.
We're close.

1011
01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:59.890
I will finish what you started.

1012
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.130
Good. good Murph.

1013
01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:07.430
You had faith.

1014
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:12.980
All those. all those years.

1015
01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:17.980
I asked you to have faith.

1016
01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:30.130
I wanted you to believe. that your father would come back.

1017
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:32.400
I do Professor.

1018
01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:38.050
Forgive me Murph.
-There's nothing to forgive.

1019
01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:44.780
I lied Murph.

1020
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.210
I lied to you.

1021
01:32:53.940 --> 01:33:00.890
There was no need for him. to come back.

1022
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:07.280
There's no way to help us.

1023
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:10.690
But the Plan A? All this?

1024
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:16.070
All these people.
And the equation?

1025
01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.380
Did my father know?

1026
01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.880
Did he leave me?

1027
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:39.700
'Do....not....go....gentle....'

1028
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:45.670
No. NO!

1029
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:50.090
You can't leave.
NO!!

1030
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.300
Dr. Brand. I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1031
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.500
He didn't feel any pain. He was at peace.

1032
01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:00.350
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1033
01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:15.130
Brand did you know?

1034
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.930
Did he tell you the truth?

1035
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:23.190
Did you know?

1036
01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.690
This was all a sham.

1037
01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.940
You left us here.

1038
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.760
To suffocate.

1039
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.850
To starve.

1040
01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:09.030
A frozen cloud.

1041
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:36.250
It's okay.

1042
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:44.520
It's okay.

1043
01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.580
It's okay.

1044
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:51.660
Pray you never learn.

1045
01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.020
just how good it can be to see another face.

1046
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.490
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

1047
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:13.960
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1048
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:20.030
The last time I went to sleep.
I didn't even set up a waking date.

1049
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:26.490
You've literally raised me from the dead.

1050
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.720
Lazarus.

1051
01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.870
What about the others?
-I'm afraid you're it sir.

1052
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.800
So far. surely.

1053
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:40.050
No. In our present situation...

1054
01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.860
...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.

1055
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:47.370
Dr. Mann.

1056
01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.000
Dr. Mann. tell us about your world.

1057
01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.250
Our world. we hope...

1058
01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:07.730
Our world is cold. stark.
but undeniably beautiful.

1059
01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:12.980
The days are 67 hours long. cold.

1060
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:20.790
The nights are 67 more colder hours.

1061
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:31.710
The gravity is a very. very pleasant
80% of the Earth's.

1062
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:35.000
Now here. where I landed.
the water is alkali.

1063
01:39:35.110 --> 01:39:38.810
And the air is too much ammonia
to breathe for more than just a few minutes.

1064
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:43.490
But. down at the surface. and there is. a surface.

1065
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:48.140
the chlorine dissipates.
the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

1066
01:39:48.250 --> 01:39:50.980
Breathable air. to organics.

1067
01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:53.830
Possibly even. to life.

1068
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:56.750
We might be sharing this world.

1069
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:59.150
These readings are from the surface?

1070
01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:03.980
Over the years. I've dropped various probes.
-How far have you explored?

1071
01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:07.040
I have managed several major expeditions.
but with oxygen in...

1072
01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.060
...limited supply. Kipp there.
really did most of the legwork.
-What went wrong with him sir?

1073
01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.970
Degeneration. He misidentified...

1074
01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:19.930
...the first organics we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time. but...

1075
01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:23.900
...ultimately I had to decommission him.
use his power source to keep the mission going.

1076
01:40:24.090 --> 01:40:28.270
I thought I was alone even before I shut him down.
-Would you like me to take a look at him?

1077
01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:31.690
No. no. needs a human touch.

1078
01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.010
Dr. Brand. CASE is relaying a message...

1079
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:38.300
...for you. from the spaceship.
-Okay. be right there. Excuse me.

1080
01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:53.890
Dr. Brand. I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1081
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:59.690
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1082
01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:04.000
I'm sorry for your loss.

1083
01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:11.210
Is that Murph?
-She's....she's grown!

1084
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.290
Brand did you know?

1085
01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.220
Did he tell you the truth?

1086
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.570
Did you know?

1087
01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:25.350
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

1088
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.160
To suffocate.

1089
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:32.570
To starve.

1090
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:37.830
Did my father know too?

1091
01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.280
Dad!

1092
01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:49.490
I just want to know. if you left me here to die?

1093
01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:53.580
I just have to know!

1094
01:41:58.690 --> 01:42:07.430
Cooper. my father dedicated
his whole life to plan A. I have...

1095
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.630
...no idea what she's talking about.

1096
01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:12.200
I do.

1097
01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:20.510
He. he never even hoped to get the
people off the Earth?

1098
01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:22.200
No.

1099
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.490
But he has been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1100
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.810
Amelia. your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1101
01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.800
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1102
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:41.370
The equation couldn't reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics
You need more.

1103
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:46.070
More? More what?
-More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1104
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:50.210
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
-Romilly. is that true?

1105
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:55.290
If the black hole is an oyster. then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1106
01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.710
The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...

1107
01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:59.540
...in darkness. beyond the horizon.

1108
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:02.860
That's why we call it a 'black' hole.

1109
01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:07.200
Okay....if we were to see beyond the horizon.

1110
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:11.360
You can't Cooper.
-There are some things that aren't meant to be known.

1111
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:15.890
Your father had to find another way to save
the human race from extinction.

1112
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:19.460
Plan B. a colony.
-But why not tell people?

1113
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:22.290
Why keep it from us?

1114
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.780
Because he knew how hard it would be
to get people...

1115
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.780
...to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

1116
01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.970
Bullshit!

1117
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:33.820
You never would have here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1118
01:43:33.930 --> 01:43:36.690
Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier.

1119
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:40.980
We can care deeply. selflessly
about those we know.

1120
01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:45.410
But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
-But the lie?

1121
01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:53.330
That monstrous lie?
-Unforgivable.

1122
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:58.230
And he knew that.
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity.

1123
01:43:58.350 --> 01:44:01.840
in order to save the species.
he made an incredible sacrifice.

1124
01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:06.450
NO! No. an incredible sacrifice is being made.

1125
01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.420
by the people on Earth who're gonna die!

1126
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:14.080
Because in his fucking arrogance.
he declared their case hopeless.

1127
01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:18.640
I'm sorry Cooper.
their case is hopeless.

1128
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.910
No. No.
-we are the future.

1129
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:25.570
Cooper.

1130
01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.250
Cooper. what I can do?

1131
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:33.000
Let me go home.

1132
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:36.170
You're absolutely positive?

1133
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:40.790
His solution was correct. He had it for years.
-It's worthless?

1134
01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.490
It's half the answer.

1135
01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.630
Okay. how do you find the other half?

1136
01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:49.880
Out there. in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

1137
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:51.500
Yeah?

1138
01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:54.240
I'm not sure you can.

1139
01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:59.080
They just. pack up and leave?

1140
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.470
What do they expect to find?
-Survival.

1141
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.050
Damn it!

1142
01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.960
Murph. don't. don't people have the right to know?

1143
01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.510
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working. same as ever.

1144
01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:27.800
Yes. but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

1145
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.220
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1146
01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.740
So. do you have an idea?

1147
01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.400
A feeling.

1148
01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.840
I told you about my ghost.

1149
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:52.450
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

1150
01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:57.990
But I was never scared of it.

1151
01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:06.700
I called it a ghost because...
it felt like a person.

1152
01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:11.310
that was trying to tell me something.

1153
01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:16.680
If there is an answer
here on Earth. it's back there.

1154
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:21.000
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

1155
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:26.470
We're running out of time.

1156
01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.650
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1157
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:34.420
They can stay CASE.
I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway.
-Hey Coop. -Yeah?

1158
01:46:34.530 --> 01:46:37.970
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
-What is that?

1159
01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.950
One last crack at the black hole.

1160
01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:44.760
I'm going home Rom.
-Yeah I know.

1161
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:49.530
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

1162
01:46:49.610 --> 01:46:53.370
Talk to me.
-Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.

1163
01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.700
It has what we call a 'gentle' singularity.
-Gentle?

1164
01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:01.210
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...

1165
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.600
...crossing the horizon fast. might survive.
A probe say.

1166
01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:07.150
What happens after it crosses?

1167
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:10.110
What is beyond the horizon.
is a complete mystery.

1168
01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:12.980
So. what's to say that there is some
way that the probe can...

1169
01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.910
...glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1170
01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:20.060
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...

1171
01:47:20.150 --> 01:47:25.000
Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor?
-TARS is the obvious candidate.

1172
01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.720
I've already told him what to look for.

1173
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.050
I'll need the optical transmitter on KIPP. Cooper.
-You would do this for us?

1174
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.000
Before you get all teary.
try to remember that as a robot...

1175
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:38.690
...I have to do anything you say.
-Your cue light's blinking.

1176
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.180
I'm not joking!

1177
01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.520
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1178
01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:50.180
Well. I don't wanna disturb his archival functions.
-I'll supervise.

1179
01:47:50.290 --> 01:47:54.470
Alright.
-Dr. Mann. we need to find 3 secure sites.

1180
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:56.810
One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.

1181
01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.470
When the modules are landed.
you don't wanna move.

1182
01:47:59.570 --> 01:48:01.730
Well I can take you to the probes sites.
but I don't think these...

1183
01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.760
...conditions are gonna hold.
We should wait.

1184
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:07.750
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

1185
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:10.420
I would like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1186
01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:15.930
Well. these squalls usually do blow over.

1187
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:19.100
Okay then.
-You're gonna need a long-range transmitter.

1188
01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:20.990
Right.
-Are you charged? -Yeah.

1189
01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.490
Follow me.

1190
01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:27.300
TARS. 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper.

1191
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:36.530
Brand told me why you've got to go back.

1192
01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:42.120
But I'd be remiss
if I at least didn't mention that a mission...

1193
01:48:42.190 --> 01:48:45.360
...such as ours could certainly do
with an extra engineer.

1194
01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.160
Oh you better slow down turbo.

1195
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:54.210
Safety first CASE. do not forget.
-Safety first Cooper.

1196
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:58.750
I have to tell you Dr. Mann
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1197
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.020
But once we set up
base camp and...

1198
01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:05.490
...secure those modules. my work is done here.
I'm going home.

1199
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.050
We have attachments.

1200
01:49:15.130 --> 01:49:19.410
But even without a family.
I promise you that. that yearning...

1201
01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.000
...to be with other people is remarkable.

1202
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:28.080
That emotion is. at the foundation. of what makes us humans.

1203
01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:40.420
How long have you had that cough?
-For a while.

1204
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:52.650
Mom let's me play in here.

1205
01:49:53.190 --> 01:49:55.530
I don't touch your stuff.

1206
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.230
Just take this gently.

1207
01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.110
You know why we couldn't just send
machines on these missions. don't you Cooper?

1208
01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:42.200
A machine doesn't improvise well.
because you can't programme the fear of death.

1209
01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.840
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest source of inspiration.

1210
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:48.940
Take your example.

1211
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:54.990
A father. with a survival instinct
that extends to his kids.

1212
01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.460
What does research tell us. is the
last thing you're gonna see. before you die?

1213
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.290
Your children.
Their faces.

1214
01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:09.470
At the moment of death. your mind
will push you a little bit harder. to survive.

1215
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:13.140
For them.

1216
01:51:15.230 --> 01:51:19.250
Hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me.

1217
01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:21.820
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.

1218
01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:23.960
OK? -Yes.

1219
01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:36.380
TARS. what's taking so long?
-Professor. I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

1220
01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:38.280
I don't understand?

1221
01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.250
It's funny.

1222
01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:53.290
When I left Earth.
I thought I was prepared to die.

1223
01:51:54.260 --> 01:52:01.540
The truth is. I never really. considered...

1224
01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:03.950
...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1225
01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:10.150
Nothing turns out as it's supposed to be.
-Let's go.

1226
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:16.390
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!

1227
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.710
What is this?
-What are you doing??

1228
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:32.180
Sorry. I can't let you leave
with that ship.

1229
01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.920
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

1230
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:40.020
Once the others. realize what this place isn't.
We cannot survive here.

1231
01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:42.490
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1232
01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.790
They can't stay here anymore.

1233
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:57.490
You have to leave right now. You understand.
Hey buddy. let me make something abundantly clear...

1234
01:52:57.570 --> 01:53:00.330
You have a responsibility.
-Shit.

1235
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:03.040
Coop. get her stuff.
-Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!

1236
01:53:03.150 --> 01:53:05.220
Daddy do not you were raised to be stupid.

1237
01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.590
Dad didn't raise me. grandpa did.
and he's buried...

1238
01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.110
...out back with mom and Jesse.

1239
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:20.600
All the data?

1240
01:53:20.670 --> 01:53:25.500
No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.

1241
01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:30.430
But I knew. the day that I arrived here.
this place had nothing...

1242
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:34.780
...and I resisted the temptation. for years

1243
01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:42.820
But. I knew that. if I just pressed
that button. probably. somebody would come to save me.

1244
01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:47.320
You fucking coward!
-Yes.

1245
01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.700
Yes.

1246
01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.620
Yes.

1247
01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:58.560
Yes.

1248
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:15.180
Listen. if you're not gonna go. let your family go.
Just save your family.

1249
01:54:15.210 --> 01:54:20.070
And go to live underground? With you?
And pray that dad would come to save us?

1250
01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:24.060
Daddy is not coming back. He never was coming back.
It's upto me!

1251
01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:28.970
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad couldn't do it?. -Dad didn't even try!

1252
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:30.790
Dad just abandoned us!!

1253
01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:36.230
He left us here to die.
-Nobody is going with you.

1254
01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:42.320
You're gonn await for your next kid to die?

1255
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:49.240
Get out. and don't come back!

1256
01:54:54.010 --> 01:54:55.850
Do what you want with those things.

1257
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:08.240
Stop it!

1258
01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:12.560
No. NO!

1259
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:16.840
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourselves.

1260
01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.650
Those are the best odds i've had in years!

1261
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:44.540
Don't judge me Cooper.
You were never tested like I was.

1262
01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:46.910
Very few have.

1263
01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.900
You tried your best Murph.

1264
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.620
Do you feel it?

1265
01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:10.930
The survival instinct.

1266
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:16.510
That's what drove me.
And that is all. that's gonna save us.

1267
01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:20.340
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

1268
01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:29.470
I'm sorry. I can't.
I can't watch you go through this.

1269
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:31.820
I thought I could. but I can't.

1270
01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.550
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1271
01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:39.450
Listen to my voice Cooper. I'm right here.

1272
01:56:40.570 --> 01:56:43.200
You're not alone.

1273
01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:54.540
Do you see your children?

1274
01:56:57.030 --> 01:57:01.160
It's okay.
They are right there with you.

1275
01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:08.300
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem
before you left?

1276
01:57:08.410 --> 01:57:10.100
Do you remember?

1277
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:15.800
'Do not go gentle.
into that good night'

1278
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:21.620
'Old age should burn. and rave
at close of day.'

1279
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:26.320
'Rage. rage against the
dying of the light.'

1280
01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:53.620
Help! Help!
-Cooper?

1281
01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:03.360
CASE!
-Brand.

1282
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:05.190
No air!

1283
01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:10.670
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have his position.

1284
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:13.090
Come on. come on. come on.

1285
01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:27.670
Cooper we're coming. do not talk!

1286
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:30.260
Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!

1287
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:35.740
There is a security lockout sir. it requires...

1288
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:38.510
...a person to access the functions.

1289
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:46.280
All yours sir.

1290
01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:57.540
Getting harder to breathe.

1291
01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:02.550
We are almost there!

1292
01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:03.580
Cooper!!

1293
01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.660
Come on.

1294
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.310
I see him! I see him!
To the right.

1295
01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:41.600
Cooper!
Cooper. I'm here.

1296
01:59:47.150 --> 01:59:48.170
Take this!

1297
01:59:56.010 --> 01:59:57.700
Joey bring the tankers!

1298
02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:06.620
This data makes no sense.

1299
02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.770
I'm sorry.
-What?

1300
02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:19.730
Mann. was lying!

1301
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:32.420
Romilly!

1302
02:00:32.530 --> 02:00:35.820
Romilly. do you read me?
Romilly!!

1303
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:37.700
STEP BACK PROFESSOR!!

1304
02:00:45.070 --> 02:00:48.340
Romilly. -Romilly! Are you listening?

1305
02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.320
Keep watch!

1306
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:57.090
Lois!
-What happened to caution CASE?

1307
02:00:57.170 --> 02:00:58.540
Safety first Cooper.

1308
02:00:58.610 --> 02:01:02.360
Romilly. Romilly do you read me?

1309
02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.180
Romilly!
-Dr. Brand. Cooper. there's been an explosion.

1310
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:11.220
Dr. Mann's compound.

1311
02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:41.060
TARS. TARS! 10 o'clock.

1312
02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:49.500
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

1313
02:01:53.070 --> 02:01:54.830
Romilly did not survive.

1314
02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:59.940
I could not save him.
-TARS is in. I'll take it from here!

1315
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:02.440
D'you have a fix on the Ranger?
-He is pushing into orbit.

1316
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:05.770
Ah. if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

1317
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.250
He'd maroon us?
-He is marooning us!

1318
02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:15.170
Go downstairs. Wait for a while.

1319
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:25.770
Let's go.
Get in the back!

1320
02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.850
Come on fast!

1321
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:36.720
Dr. Mann please respond!
Dr. Mann please respond!!

1322
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:40.830
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure.
-But the autopilot does.

1323
02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:44.720
Not since TARS disbled it!
-Nice!

1324
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:47.600
What is your trust setting TARS?
-Lower than yours apparently!

1325
02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:55.520
Do not attempt docking. I repeat do not attempt docking.

1326
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:57.610
Auto docking sequence withheld.

1327
02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:01.960
Override. -Unauthorized.
-Override!

1328
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:04.160
Unauthorized.

1329
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:13.210
Do not attempt docking. I repeat Do Not! attempt docking! Please resp...

1330
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:58.660
Moving slowly towards the Endurance.

1331
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:27.290
Imperfect contact.
-Override! -Hatch locked.

1332
02:05:34.730 --> 02:05:37.140
Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.

1333
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:40.860
Dr. Mann...

1334
02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:04.470
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1335
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:17.280
Dr. Mann. do not. I repeat. do not open the hatch.

1336
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:22.120
I repeat. do not open the hatch.
If you open the hatch. the airlock will be depressurized.

1337
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:50.580
What if he blows the airlock?
-Nothing good.

1338
02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:00.620
Okay. pull back. pull back. Retro thrusters full CASE.
-Maximum. -Back.

1339
02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.650
CASE conveys my message
to the onboard computer...

1340
02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:05.260
...and have it broadcast
through the emergency PA.

1341
02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:11.180
Dr. Mann. do not open the air hatch.

1342
02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:13.590
I repeat. do not open the air hatch. -Brand?

1343
02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:18.640
I don't know what he said to you?
But I'm taking command of the Endurance.

1344
02:07:18.710 --> 02:07:21.490
And then we talk about completing the mission.

1345
02:07:24.010 --> 02:07:26.850
Dr. Mann. listen to me!

1346
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:30.810
This is not about my life. or Cooper's life.

1347
02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.690
This is about all mankind.

1348
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.810
There is a moment...

1349
02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.120
It's not...

1350
02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:53.940
Oh. my God.

1351
02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:17.590
Cooper there's no point in using your fuel...
-Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1352
02:08:21.670 --> 02:08:24.480
-Cooper. what are you doing?
-Docking.

1353
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:30.530
Computer says rotation at 67. 68 rpm.

1354
02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:34.740
Get ready to match our turn with retro thrusters.
-It's not possible.

1355
02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:36.870
-No. it's necessary.

1356
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:50.650
The Endurance is entering the stratosphere.

1357
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:56.500
It does not have a heat shield.

1358
02:08:58.950 --> 02:09:01.610
CASE. you ready?
-Ready.

1359
02:09:09.970 --> 02:09:12.790
Cooper. this is no time for caution.

1360
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.580
CASE. if I faint. you take the stick.

1361
02:09:16.690 --> 02:09:20.180
TARS. get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1362
02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:30.010
The Endurance is starting to heat.
-20 feet out.

1363
02:09:30.090 --> 02:09:33.940
I need three degrees to starboard Cooper.
-10 feet out.

1364
02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:37.580
Cooper. we are. lined up!

1365
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:39.090
Start the spin!

1366
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:22.280
Hold on TARS!

1367
02:10:30.090 --> 02:10:31.390
HOLD ON!

1368
02:10:41.850 --> 02:10:45.320
We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!

1369
02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:54.660
Slowly.

1370
02:10:55.690 --> 02:10:56.940
Slowly.

1371
02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:04.160
Retro thrusters!

1372
02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:13.940
Main engines on!

1373
02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:22.540
We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!

1374
02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:31.740
Shutting engines.

1375
02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:34.810
Okay we're out of orbit!

1376
02:11:42.370 --> 02:11:45.610
OKay! And for our next trick!

1377
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:50.700
It better be good.
We're headed into Gargantua's pull.

1378
02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:55.210
Shit. CASE take the stick.
-Roger that.

1379
02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:47.250
Cooper. we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1380
02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.920
Shall I use the engines?

1381
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:54.340
No. we gotta let her slide as much as we can!

1382
02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:06.430
Tell me.
-I have good news and bad news.

1383
02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:10.430
Yeah. throw them both TARS.

1384
02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:22.100
The back-up generator kicked in.
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1385
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:27.490
Okay.
The navigational hub is completely destroyed.

1386
02:13:27.590 --> 02:13:30.210
We don't have enough life to make it back to Earth.

1387
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:34.220
but I think we can scratch over to Edmond's planet.
-What about fuel?

1388
02:13:34.330 --> 02:13:37.040
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

1389
02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.590
We let. Gargantua. pull us down close...

1390
02:13:40.590 --> 02:13:43.720
to the horizon. and a powered slingshot...

1391
02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:46.500
...launching us towards Edmond's planet.
-Manually?

1392
02:13:46.610 --> 02:13:50.280
That's what I'm here for.
I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.

1393
02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:51.860
What about the time slippage?

1394
02:13:51.970 --> 02:13:55.470
Neither one of us has time
to think about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

1395
02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:01.060
Sorry Cooper.

1396
02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:06.330
Once we have gathered enough speed...

1397
02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:09.450
...around Gargantua.
we use Lander 1.

1398
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:12.590
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...

1399
02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:15.510
...to push us out of the black hole's gravity

1400
02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:19.900
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed.

1401
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:22.970
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

1402
02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:27.720
Once Lander 1 has spent all it's fuel.
TARS will detach...

1403
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:32.050
...and get sucked right into that black hole!
-Why does TARS have to detach?

1404
02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.650
We have to shed the weight. escape gravity.
-Newton's third law.

1405
02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:40.600
The only way humans have figured of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.

1406
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:45.660
Cooper. you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
-He's a robot...

1407
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:49.870
...so I don't have to ask him to do anything.
-Cooper. you asshole!

1408
02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:54.320
Sorry. you broke up a little bit there.
-It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

1409
02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:57.280
It's our only chance to save people on Earth.

1410
02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:02.120
if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there.
maybe they'll make it.

1411
02:15:03.710 --> 02:15:06.050
Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.

1412
02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:36.460
Maximum velocity achieved.

1413
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:41.370
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

1414
02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.980
Ready?
-Ready.

1415
02:15:44.070 --> 02:15:50.280
Firing the ignition in 3. 2. 1...

1416
02:16:05.970 --> 02:16:08.070
Engines on Lander 1 on my command.

1417
02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:13.920
3. 2. 1...

1418
02:16:18.190 --> 02:16:21.320
Engines of Ranger 2 on my command.

1419
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:25.950
3. 2. 1...

1420
02:16:37.670 --> 02:16:41.630
This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years!!

1421
02:16:41.710 --> 02:16:45.020
You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!

1422
02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:03.310
Lander 1. prepare to detach on my mark.

1423
02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:08.320
3. 2. 1...

1424
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.240
Detach!
3. 2. 1...

1425
02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:09.370
Detach!

1426
02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:16.840
Goodbye TARS!
-Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.

1427
02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:18.260
See you there slick!

1428
02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.250
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

1429
02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:32.830
Learned from the master!

1430
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:35.420
Ranger 2. prepare for detachment.

1431
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.290
-What. no. no! Cooper. Cooper.
what are you doing??

1432
02:17:46.290 --> 02:17:47.680
Newton's third law.
You gotta leave something behind!
-What. no. no! Cooper. Cooper.
what are you doing??

1433
02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:49.560
Newton's third law.
You gotta leave something behind!

1434
02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:54.330
You said we had enough resources for both of us!
-We agreed Amelia.

1435
02:17:54.370 --> 02:17:56.900
90%

1436
02:17:57.010 --> 02:17:59.180
No!

1437
02:18:00.450 --> 02:18:02.630
Detach.

1438
02:18:16.010 --> 02:18:18.430
Okay. we're nosing down.

1439
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:24.150
Approaching the event horizon.

1440
02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:37.440
Portside. dipping down beneath it. Going through it.
Heading towards it. Blackness....

1441
02:18:37.670 --> 02:18:39.540
It's all black!

1442
02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:45.960
TARS. do you read me? It's all black.

1443
02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.620
TARS. do you read me? Over.

1444
02:18:54.240 --> 02:19:00.570
We're...we're getting.
we're getting interference.

1445
02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:03.670
Losing control of the stick.

1446
02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:07.700
We've got flashes.
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1447
02:19:07.770 --> 02:19:12.480
There's a turbulence in the gravity.

1448
02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:20.080
computers going down.

1449
02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:34.950
The gravitational pull. we're losing control of the stick.

1450
02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:10.120
Murph! Let's go!

1451
02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:18.060
Murph!

1452
02:22:28.470 --> 02:22:30.600
Murph!! Murphhh!!

1453
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.540
Murph!!

1454
02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:50.160
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!!!!!

1455
02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:51.640
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

1456
02:22:52.650 --> 02:22:53.770
No. no!!!!!!!

1457
02:23:52.970 --> 02:23:56.930
If you're leaving just go!
-No.

1458
02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:01.660
No. don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!!!

1459
02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:10.480
Morse. morse. morse.

1460
02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:11.340
'S'

1461
02:24:17.570 --> 02:24:18.320
'T'

1462
02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.060
'A'

1463
02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:26.080
'-'

1464
02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.250
'-'

1465
02:24:31.050 --> 02:24:34.900
Murph. we don't have time for this. come on!

1466
02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:41.900
STAY!!!

1467
02:24:52.170 --> 02:25:02.770
Come on. come on. Murph. come on!
What's it say? What's it say? What's it say?

1468
02:25:09.970 --> 02:25:10.940
Stay.

1469
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:49.380
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

1470
02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:54.560
Make him. make him stay Murph.

1471
02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:00.390
STAY

1472
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:05.090
Murph me stay Murph!

1473
02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.900
Don't let me leave Murph!!!

1474
02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:14.950
Don't. DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!!!

1475
02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:22.220
NO. NO. NO. NOOO!!!.

1476
02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:44.920
It was you!!

1477
02:26:56.100 --> 02:26:58.580
You were my ghost!!

1478
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:13.950
Cooper. Cooper come in.
-TARS??

1479
02:27:14.100 --> 02:27:15.540
Roger that.

1480
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:20.100
You survived?
-Somewhere...

1481
02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:24.430
...in their fifth dimension.
They saved us!

1482
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:28.070
Yeah? Well who the hell is 'They'?

1483
02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:30.310
And just why would they want to help us?

1484
02:27:30.390 --> 02:27:33.470
I don't know. but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1485
02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:38.210
...inside their five dimensional
reality to allow you to understand it.
-Yeah well it ain't working.

1486
02:27:38.290 --> 02:27:44.400
Yes it is. You see that time.
is represented as a physical dimension.

1487
02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.080
You've worked out that you can exert a force
across spacetime.
-Gravity...

1488
02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:52.740
...to send a message?
-Affirmative.

1489
02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:56.650
Gravity...

1490
02:27:56.770 --> 02:28:01.230
...can cross the dimensions. including time?

1491
02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:02.760
Exactly.

1492
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:10.470
Do you have the quantum data?
-Roger. I have it.

1493
02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:13.920
I've been transferring it on all wavelengths...

1494
02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:18.080
...but nothing is getting out Cooper.
-I can do this. I can.

1495
02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:22.760
But such complicated data to a child?
-Not just any child.

1496
02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:26.430
Come on dad!

1497
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:31.230
Murph. the fire's out! come on!

1498
02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:34.990
Even though you communicate it here.
she won't understand it's significance for years!

1499
02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:40.030
No. no. I get that TARS. but
we've got to figure out something...

1500
02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:42.770
...or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think. think. think!

1501
02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.650
Cooper. they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

1502
02:28:50.310 --> 02:28:55.210
Say that again.
-They didn't bring us here. to change the past.

1503
02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:02.230
No. they didn't bring us here at all.

1504
02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:08.310
We brought ourselves!

1505
02:29:17.470 --> 02:29:21.880
TARS. give me the coordinates for NASA. in binary.

1506
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:24.340
In binary. roger. translating data.

1507
02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:50.810
It's not a ghost.

1508
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:56.260
It's gravity.
-Don't you get it yet TARS?

1509
02:29:56.370 --> 02:29:58.210
I brought myself here!

1510
02:29:58.710 --> 02:30:02.660
We're here to communicate.
with the three dimensional world!

1511
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:04.490
We are the bridge!

1512
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:14.770
I thought they chose me.

1513
02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:21.400
But they didn't choose me. they chose her!
-To do what Cooper?

1514
02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:25.520
To save the world!

1515
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:33.680
All of this! In one. little girl's bedroom.

1516
02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:36.210
Every moment. is infinitely complex.

1517
02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:39.310
They have access to infinite time and space...

1518
02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:40.940
...but they're not bound by anything!

1519
02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:45.820
They can't find. a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1520
02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:49.600
That's why I'm here.
-I'm here to find a way...

1521
02:30:49.620 --> 02:30:52.750
...to tell Murph.
just like I found this moment.
-How Cooper?

1522
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:54.420
Love TARS. love!

1523
02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:58.130
It's just like Brand said.
my connection with Murph. it is quantifiable.

1524
02:30:58.240 --> 02:31:00.740
It is the key. -Why are we here?

1525
02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:03.840
To find out how to tell.

1526
02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:08.120
The watch!

1527
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:14.810
The watch!

1528
02:31:17.050 --> 02:31:20.210
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

1529
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:27.630
TARS. translate the data into Morse
and give it to me.

1530
02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:31.060
Translating the data to Morse.
Cooper. What if she never came back for it?

1531
02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:36.030
She will. She will.

1532
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:41.430
He's coming Murph!

1533
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:47.530
Okay. coming down!
-How do you know?

1534
02:31:50.980 --> 02:31:52.750
Because I gave it to her!

1535
02:31:57.400 --> 02:32:00.860
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot.

1536
02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:08.590
Dot. dot. dash. dot.

1537
02:32:08.660 --> 02:32:10.900
dot. dash. dot. dot.

1538
02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:15.660
dot. dash. dot. dot.

1539
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:39.490
It was him!!

1540
02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:42.910
All the time!!
I knew it!!!

1541
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.180
Dad saved us!!

1542
02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:31.070
Eureka!!!

1543
02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.430
It's traditional.

1544
02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:41.300
Eureka!!!

1545
02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:49.450
Did it work?
-I think it might have.

1546
02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:52.480
How do you know?

1547
02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:56.000
Because. the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

1548
02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:01.840
Don't you get it yet TARS?

1549
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:05.220
They're not beings.

1550
02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:06.990
They're us!

1551
02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:12.280
What I've been doing for Murph.
they've been doing for me!

1552
02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:16.270
For all of us.
-Cooper. people couldn't build this.

1553
02:34:16.350 --> 02:34:20.880
No. no. Not yet. But one day.

1554
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:24.910
Not you and me. But people.

1555
02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:30.630
A civilization that's evolved
past the 4 dimensions that we know.

1556
02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:37.300
What happens now?

1557
02:35:40.270 --> 02:35:41.130
Mr. Cooper.

1558
02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:49.560
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

1559
02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.440
Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.

1560
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:55.000
Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.

1561
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:03.650
Take it slow sir.

1562
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:06.620
You were. um. extremely lucky.

1563
02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:11.010
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1564
02:36:23.010 --> 02:36:25.790
Where am I?

1565
02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:29.280
Cooper station.

1566
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:32.210
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1567
02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:36.190
Cooper station?

1568
02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:41.380
Well it's nice of you to name it after me!

1569
02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.020
What?
-Well. the station isn't named after you sir.

1570
02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:49.530
It's uh. it's named after your daughter.

1571
02:36:49.610 --> 02:36:54.030
Although she's always maintained
how important you were.
-Is she still alive?

1572
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:57.970
She'll be here in a couple of weeks.

1573
02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:02.310
She is far too old to be
transferred from another station...

1574
02:37:02.390 --> 02:37:04.620
...but when she heard that you'd been found.

1575
02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:08.250
Well this is. well this is
Murphy Cooper we're talking about!

1576
02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:10.240
Yes it is!

1577
02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:14.740
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple of days.

1578
02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:20.360
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.

1579
02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:25.890
I actually. did a paper on you.
in uhh...high school.

1580
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.630
I kinda knew all about you. back then.

1581
02:37:29.430 --> 02:37:32.130
Oh yeah. right.

1582
02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:39.860
Sir. if you could follow me?
You've got a really good situation.

1583
02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:47.030
So um. when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper.

1584
02:37:48.370 --> 02:37:51.310
I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.

1585
02:37:57.930 --> 02:38:01.700
Well of course. I didn't speak to her in person.

1586
02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:10.810
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1587
02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:14.140
Anyway. there just wasn't enough food.

1588
02:38:14.250 --> 02:38:20.220
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

1589
02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:22.780
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1590
02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:33.170
She did confirm. just how much you loved farming.

1591
02:38:33.250 --> 02:38:35.640
She did? Did she?

1592
02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:39.020
Well. home sweet home!

1593
02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:42.720
Everything is in its place and
faithfully reproduced.

1594
02:38:42.810 --> 02:38:44.190
Yes.

1595
02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:54.010
Hey. is this? -Oh yeah. the machine
we found out near Saturn with you.

1596
02:38:54.130 --> 02:38:57.490
It's power source is shot.
but we can get another one if you want.

1597
02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.360
Yes. please!

1598
02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:01.400
Settings.

1599
02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:03.550
General settings.

1600
02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:05.780
Security settings.

1601
02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:10.920
Honesty. new setting.

1602
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:17.010
95%
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1603
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:21.770
Humor: 75%

1604
02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:23.430
Confirmed.

1605
02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:27.550
Auto self destruct in T minus 10.9...

1606
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:29.240
Let's make that 60%.

1607
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:33.810
60% confirmed.

1608
02:39:33.890 --> 02:39:37.630
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

1609
02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Is this really what it was like?

1610
02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:49.040
It was never this clean slick.

1611
02:39:53.770 --> 02:39:58.290
I don't care much for this. pretending
we are back where we started.

1612
02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:01.350
I want to know where we are?

1613
02:40:02.470 --> 02:40:04.800
Where are we going?

1614
02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:12.140
Mr Cooper. -Yes?
-The family is all in there.

1615
02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:13.930
Family?

1616
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:17.890
Yeah. they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

1617
02:40:50.530 --> 02:40:53.300
You told them I liked farming?

1618
02:40:58.740 --> 02:40:59.890
It was me Murph!

1619
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:04.750
I was your ghost!

1620
02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:07.270
I know.

1621
02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:15.040
People didn't believe me.
they thought I was doing it all by myself. But...

1622
02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:20.630
...I knew it was you.

1623
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:26.860
Nobody believed me.

1624
02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:29.930
But I knew you'd come back.

1625
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:33.340
How?

1626
02:41:34.690 --> 02:41:38.650
Because my dad promised me!

1627
02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:49.140
I'm here now Murph.
I'm here!

1628
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:58.390
No. No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

1629
02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:04.660
I have my kids here for me now.

1630
02:42:06.930 --> 02:42:09.000
You go!

1631
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:12.490
Where?

1632
02:42:15.850 --> 02:42:17.970
Brand.

1633
02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.790
She's. out there.

1634
02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:37.320
Setting up camp.

1635
02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.310
Alone. in a strange galaxy.

1636
02:43:20.050 --> 02:43:23.520
Maybe right now she's. settling in...

1637
02:43:23.550 --> 02:43:25.870
...for the long nap.

1638
02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:46.250
By the light of our new sun.

1639
02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:03.860
In our new home.
