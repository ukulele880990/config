00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.437
Blood. blood. blood! And death.

4
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.637
All right. you know
what. you're milking it.

5
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.560
Besides. I think we got it.
I think we got it.

6
00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:34.717
We got it up there.
Thank you. Yakety-yak!

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.637
You laid it all out beautifully.

8
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.280
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you. too.

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720
It's my word against yours.

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.980
Actually... 

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.680
<i>And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.400
It's your word against yours.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.680
It's called a hustle. sweetheart.

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.680
Boom.

15
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.560
Unlikely duo. Judy Hopps.
the city's first bunny cop.

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.397
and Nicholas Wilde.
a small-time street fox.

17
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.877
uncovered a conspiracy by Mayor Bellwether
today using a toy carrot recorder pen.

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.320
<i>I can frame you. too.</i>

19
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.717
Wilde later joined the ZPD himself.
where the pair are now the very first

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.640
bunny-fox team in the history of Zootopia.

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.397
New mayor and former actor
Brian Winddancer. hailed the two during

22
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.337
celebrations for the 100th anniversary
of the invention of Zootopia's weather walls

23
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.597
that allowed all environments
and all animals to coexist in one city.

24
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
This is our Zootennial.

25
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.037
And if a lowly country bunny and a shifty
likely criminal fox can ignore their vast.

26
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.560
vast differences and solve bias
and stereotype forever.

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.317
then maybe we can all embrace our

28
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.040
differences and be better zoogether.

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.837
We're gonna crack a new case.
make the world a better place.

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800
and be the greatest partners of all time!

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.120
I mean. we're not that different.

32
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.320
At the ZPD. partnership is
the cornerstone of success.

33
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.480
You want to put bad guys away?

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.280
Be on the same page every day.

35
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.840
Now. today's bad guy is this customs
inspector. who's been

36
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.720
smuggling illegal overseas cargo
through the city's shipyard.

37
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.797
Captains Hoggbottom and Truffler will lead.

38
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.977
Higgins. Bloats. flank left. 
Chèvre. Bücheron. right. and

39
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.200
- down the middle. the Zebros.
- Zebros!

40
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.840
Hopps and Wilde.
I know you're eager to prove yourselves.

41
00:02:50.923 --> 00:02:56.480
but as rookies. you will observe only and
watch the veteran teams show you how it-

42
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.200
Chief. hi.

43
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800
If you're looking for Nick and Judy.

44
00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:05.800
They said they got it! And they're
already on site with their baby!

45
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.157
Are you sure this will work?

46
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.000
You're the one that said we needed a bust.

47
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.197
Just follow my lead. okay?
Act casual.

48
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.437
- Hey!
- Here we go.

49
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.960
Hello!

50
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.200
This whole area is restricted.
You can't be here.

51
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.397
Whoa.
Fox and Bunny.

52
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.240
- Okay..
- Yes. but proud parents first. Mr...

53
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.957
Inspector.
Inspector Snootley.

54
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.637
Inspector?

55
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.800
What do you do?

56
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.040
Ensure that nothing illegal gets smuggled
here in one of these cargo containers?

57
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.800
That's a weird way to ask that.

58
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.997
Anyway. you got to leave.

59
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.160
You can't be here.

60
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.960
Wait. wait.

61
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.080
He's right.
Gosh. darn it.

62
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.000
You are right. sir.

63
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.720
I guess we should have thought
this through. right. babe?

64
00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.677
Before we decided to come down here
to this beautiful industrial shipyard to

65
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.680
celebrate the big day of our birthday boy.

66
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.320
It's his birthday?

67
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.360
Yeah. first one since...

68
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.880
Since the accident.

69
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
And you know the one thing this little
stinker wished for.

70
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.960
aside from one day getting his tail
reattached. yeah. was to see a choo-choo.

71
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.797
And to maybe get a toot-toot
conductor to sign his cast.

72
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.160
But I'm betting a Customs Inspector
would be even better.

73
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.200
Really?

74
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.317
All right.
For the kid.

75
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.000
- For the kid.
- Oh. you're a saint.

76
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.520
We thank you so much.
Here you go.

77
00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:43.200
Either leg. Or both!
I don't care.

78
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.920
Maybe put a doodle on it.
Doesn't need to be perfect.

79
00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:47.360
He's also legally blind.

80
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.117
I put a little train there
because I know you like trains.

81
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.360
Come on. come on. come on.

82
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.037
- Just..
- Yes. I know.
- Hurry!

83
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.840
I got this.

84
00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:02.877
Jiggle it. jiggle it.
jiggle it. jiggle it.

85
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.597
Hopps and Wilde!

86
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.117
You are not authorized!

87
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.160
Stand down and wait for backup.

88
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.677
- Toot-toot.
- It's the fuzz!

89
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.597
Stop!
Stop in the name of the law!

90
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.240
Everybody. run!

91
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.400
Well. can't win them all.

92
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.920
Get out of the road. you dumb bunny.

93
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.560
Agree to disagree.

94
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.120
My hog rod!

95
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.637

96
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.477
Hopps and Wilde in pursuit of suspect
in a stolen catering van heading east-

97
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.560
Stop it!
Heading east through Sheepshire.

98
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.757
Beautiful!

99
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.280
I'll have what he's having.

100
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.120
Darlin'. I believe your driving's
giving me some white hairs.

101
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.277
Also. am I always gonna be
in the passenger seat?

102
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.760
- Cause if we're establishing sides- 
- Back off. rookies!

103
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.477
Let the real teams handle it!

104
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.277
Ma'am. we are a real team.

105
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.840
Shortcut. take the tunnel.

106
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.517
Stand out. noobs.

107
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.797
We got him. Rolling spikes!

108
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.177
Rolling spikes.

109
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.117

110
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.160
I hate that dumb bunny.

111
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.637
I'm gonna jump.

112
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.360
No. no. no. what.
what are you. you can't.

113
00:07:09.443 --> 00:07:11.597
Hey. I would like to call
a partner meeting.

114
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.640
You can't-
Judy!

115
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.077
Please. join me in a moment of silence

116
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.240
for our beloved weather wall inventor.
Ebenezer Lynxley.

117
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.520
Zebros!

118
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.400

119
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.520
Reptile.

120
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Zootopia ain't just a mammal city.

121
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.280
It has a secret tiny reptile population.

122
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.560
The most live abroad.

123
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.920
Of course. Zootopia does not allow snakes.

124
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.640
Ain't been one of those around
here for a at least 100 years.

125
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.877
Scales and Tales of the Weird! 

126
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.080
Yeah. not sure Nibbles Maplestick is
our most reliable source.

127
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.840
Bunny. orange dog. in here now.

128
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.840
Sir. today may not have been ideal.
but the anteater was captured.

129
00:08:32.923 --> 00:08:34.997
- By the Zebros!
- Zebros!

130
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.920
- Shut it!
- Zebros.

131
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.280
It was us.

132
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.440
But more importantly. I believe we
may have made a significant discovery.

133
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.597
The stolen van contained a smuggled crate
from overseas. pamphlets for the Zootennial

134
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.477
and some type of reptile skin.

135
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.040
I've already sent samples for testing.

136
00:08:51.123 --> 00:08:53.437
What needs testing is you.

137
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.837
You two tore up half the city!

138
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.517
Because of you. we had to call in Jumbo
Unit to remove a dik-dik from a tuba!

139
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600
- You're almost out!
- Please help! Please help!

140
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.120
- Who's catching him?
- Sorry.

141
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.600
could you show me that clip again?

142
00:09:07.683 --> 00:09:09.100
Wasn't wearing my glasses.

143
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.397
Did you or did you not disobey
a direct order to stand down?

144
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.557
Sir. we were in pursuit. and Article 6.
Paragraph B states if the lead officer-

145
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.677
You are not lead officers!

146
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.200
You're one hit wonders who should go back
to meter maiding and slinging popsicles.

147
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.760
If I may. I think someone's just jealous
that we got to drive the squeal mobile.

148
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.957
- Or maybe you thought it was your mama.
- What?

149
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.360
Enough!
Everybody. out!

150
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.917
Officer Hopps. despite my best

151
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.040
efforts to avoid it. I like you.

152
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.797
But this need to overdo it made

153
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.120
both of you a headline today.

154
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.800
And it reflects badly on me. on the
department. and frankly. on anybody

155
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.840
hoping to follow in your footsteps.

156
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.600
Not every case is going to save the world.

157
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.080
Knock. knock.

158
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.520
Hi.

159
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.775
You know this kinda. this sounds a lot like
just a you guys conversation.

160
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.280
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go ahead-

161
00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:20.240
Is there a reason why you
don't take anything seriously?

162
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.160
Jokes are a classic defense mechanism
for someone with a traumatic childhood.

163
00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:24.960
Would you like a traumatic adulthood?

164
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.840
I would not.

165
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.160
I allowed you to work together
because you did this city a great service.

166
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.720
But today you messed it all up.

167
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.960
And now. some are questioning whether you
should have been partners

168
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:38.895
- in the first place.
- But. Sir...

169
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.335
So instead of chasing imaginary reptiles.
I am pulling you from the field.

170
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.495
And giving you a new assignment
reserved for special

171
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.840
teams like yourselves.

172
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.000
Fail at this. and I will have
no choice but to split you up.

173
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.160
There will be no more Hopps and Wilde.

174
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:05.040
But if you're good as you think you are.
this is your moment to shine.

175
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:13.560
Welcome to Partners in Crisis. a
workshop for duos heading for disaster.

176
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.095
I'm your therapy animal. Dr. Fuzzby.
and you are here because mismatched

177
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.360
pairings often need a little
more work to make them work.

178
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.095
Greg?
We talked about that.

179
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.815
What are we making Marlon?
Uncomfortable.

180
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.640
Yes.

181
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.960
And Francine. Clark may be
a mouse. but he is your partner first.

182
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.615
And we have two new partners.

183
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.920
Can you tell us about your
journey to dysfunction junction?

184
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.840
Well. we've been official
partners for one week. happy anniversary.

185
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.200
And we are not dysfunctional
at all. actually.

186
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.000
Functioning fine. better than fine.

187
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.255
And we did sorta save the city.

188
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.440
So us being here kinda seems like
a huge misunderstanding.

189
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.895
Notice how she answered first.
did not allow her partner to speak.

190
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.255
seems to be in a state of denial.
and taps her foot when she's

191
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.320
suppressing discomfort.

192
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.480
And observe the source of her
discomfort.

193
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.855
represented by the disconnected
affectation of her

194
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.440
emotionally insecure partner.

195
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.760
But with hard work. they'll
be on the same page by year two.

196
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.440
But for now. let's begin
by greeting our teammate.

197
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.000
Who'd like to go first?
Thank you. Joel.

198
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.055
Okay. unfortunately. Karen has chosen to

199
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.520
see Joel's smile as a sign of aggression.

200
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.135
Hackles down. Karen.

201
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.775
Karen hackles down.

202
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.720
Joel. the safe word is. "coconut."

203
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.120
Okay. we have to set another
meeting with the chief.

204
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.720
Promise we'll be better.

205
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.240
- Zebros...
- You talk back less.

206
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.375
Maybe not at all.

207
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.160
Yeah. or we go with my playbook
and we just lay low.

208
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.535
We cannot prove ourselves if
we are stuck in that room.

209
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.400
And if we complain to Chief Beef.
he'll just make us stay longer.

210
00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:06.000
Play it smart. stay off the radar.
and don't let it get to you. okay?

211
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.360
Cause we are the dream team.

212
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.040
Sorry. Paul.

213
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.415
Oh. roll out the red carpet.

214
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.560
Here's the Supercops.

215
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.960
What does the fox say?

216
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.320
- You suck.
- Easy. partner.

217
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.840
Let me ask you something.

218
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.400
- Do you think we're a good team?
- Of course.

219
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.000
I just. I just wish I knew what we had to do
to prove it to everyone else.

220
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.360
Or maybe we don't have
to prove anything to anybody.

221
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.080
We do.

222
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.255
Forever.

223
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.840
And the sooner everyone sees a fox and a
bunny can be great partners. the better.

224
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.735
Enjoy it.
I got two.

225
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.440
I'd rather chew off my own arm.

226
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.640
Happy anniversary.

227
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.890
So. saw you on TV. You okay?

228
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.255
- Everything's fine. Mom.
- Uh-oh.

229
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.160
Everyone knows fine is a cry for help.

230
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.600
You know who else cried for help?

231
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.455
That dik-dik stuck in that tuba.

232
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.655
Oh. him and the dik-dik.

233
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.215
What does your fox partner say?

234
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.040
Well. Nick's not really a talker.

235
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.120
Well. you two are very different.

236
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.655
Small town hero. raised on a farm.

237
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.735
Big city crook. raised on the streets.

238
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.295
I pray every day that you'll
come back home and make babies.

239
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.120
Just remember the first
rule of partnerships.

240
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.175
- You can be right or you can be happy.
- That's true.

241
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.295
There's nothing wrong with dying a little
inside so you can meet in the middle.

242
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.615
Honey. you're pushing me out.

243
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.775
I want to make sure I can be seen.

244
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.520
- Well. if she could see both of us.
- Okay. gotta go.

245
00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:08.695
- Work to do.
- Bye. bun-bun.

246
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.840
Everything's gonna be fine.

247
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:11.615
- You two just need a new case.
- Got it.

248
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.200
- Love you.
- Hey. maybe try to find that dik-dik.

249
00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:13.680
Bye.

250
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.520
Ding-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!

251
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.890
Squeal of Fortune!

252
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.215
- Tomorrow's weather is. again. everything.
- To announce that the long-awaited

253
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.520
Tundratown expansion will be starting soon.

254
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.480
Residents continue to raise concerns
about the future of their neighborhood.

255
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.775
But tonight. we put our differences
aside and celebrate at the Zootennial Gala.

256
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.975
where the Lynxley Journal will be
on display for the first time

257
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.720
in a century. following
an infamous reptile attack.

258
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.880
The Lynxley Journal.
containing the patented weather wall plans.

259
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.560
was originally written by Ebenezer Lynxley. 
bringing the whole world...

260
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.680
Same catering company.

261
00:16:32.005 --> 00:16:33.200
The Lynxley Journal.

262
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.760
Truth Bomb!

263
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.520
The 100th anniversary of the weather walls
is also the 100th anniversary

264
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.280
of Zootopia's only snake attack.

265
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.520
The victim?
A tortoise.

266
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.595
The Lynxley family maid.
who was fanged while stopping

267
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.040
a venomous snake from 
stealing the Lynxley Journal.

268
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:07.920
No one has seen a snake in Zootopia since.
but I'm convinced one will return.

269
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.680
My only question is. is he going to be
wearing half a pants or one long sock?

270
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.040
You say justice is dead.

271
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.800
I say neigh!

272
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.295
Well. well. you missed me already. huh?

273
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.920
The stolen van with the snake skin is
from the same catering company

274
00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:35.330
that's working the gala.

275
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.480
- This is you studying your partner book?
- Listen to me.

276
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.280
Venomous snakes tried to steal
the Lynxley's journal before.

277
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.415
What if they're back
in town to steal it again?

278
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.040
No snake has set foot
in Zootopia in forever.

279
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.560
Okay? Even if they had feet.

280
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.240
Look. we're already in the hot seat. Carrots.

281
00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:51.935
And pizza's here.
Gotta go-

282
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.040
If there's a fanging at the gala and we
do nothing to stop it.

283
00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:56.735
then we are not doing our jobs.
Yikes.

284
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.680
- No wonder you never invite me over.
- Foxes are solitary.

285
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.855
And look. we go and you're wrong.
Chief Beef will split us up.

286
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.050
And if we don't get a win soon and prove
we're great partners.

287
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.840
the chief will split us up anyway.

288
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.735
Check the perimeter. snoop a little.

289
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.920
We find nothing. we bail.

290
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.640
But if I'm right. no one will question
whether you and I belong together again.

291
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.640
We need this.

292
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.800
Fine.

293
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.400
But we'll still have
to get through security.

294
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.015
And in fancy town.
a fox and a bunny won't exactly blend in.

295
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.480
That's why we'll be undercover!

296
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.015

in the driver's seat.

- Star of the Revenge Trilogy. The Neighsayer.
- No pictures. please.

317
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.255
Come on.
And that. and that one. and then this one.

318
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.300
Mr. Lynxley. Mr. Lynxley.
When will you begin the Tundratown expansion?

This one's warmer. Reptile in Tundratown 
might need that to survive the cold.

323
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.695
Oh my God. a viper.

324
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.640
A window viper.
Yeah?

325
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.520
- Backdoor ajar.
- Anyone could have left it like that.

326
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.895
And you said snoop a little.
not break and ent-

327
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.455
Oh. we were always going inside.
Got it.

328
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.935
Same page means your page.

329
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.240
It's called a hustle. sweetheart.
You change out here.

330
00:20:57.265 --> 00:20:58.140
I get the van.

331
00:21:14.865 --> 00:21:17.940
It's the Zootennial Gala. 
a bunny comes prepared.

332
00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:23.840
You know I used to dream of 
infiltrating a place like this.

333
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.600
You know. this is not your worst idea.

334
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.160
Wow. that was almost a compliment.

335
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.560
Your worst idea is what
you did with your ears.

336
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.160
Alright.

337
00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.935
Welcome to the Zootennial Gala.
Featuring the original Lynxley Journal.

338
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.895
Why would a snake want to
steal some old book anyway?

339
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.080
I don't know.

340
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.200
But no one is gonna steal it
because we are here to protect it.

341
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.600
The journal is in the reserved section.

342
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:18.800
Okay.

343
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.960
- Come on.
- Slow down.

344
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.520
You want to fit in?
Commando is not gonna cut it.

345
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.960
It's not just the clothes. mkay?

346
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.640
It is the vibe.

347
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.920
Good to see ya.

348
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.280
Hey. real nice humps.

349
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.920
Oh. is that real mink?
It's real fox.

350
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.520
Get invited to a lot of these.

351
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.920
Invited?
No.

352
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.120
But there's other reasons to hobnob.

353
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.495
Madam. excuse me.
Is this yours?

354
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.935
Why. yes.

355
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.575
Well. allow me.

356
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.680
Clever fox.
Ooh. there.

357
00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.080
I don't think it has enough guards.

358
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.800
I'll get a closer look.
Watch my six.

359
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.200
Bogo alert.

360
00:23:23.792 --> 00:23:25.708
Cover's made of metal.

361
00:23:25.908 --> 00:23:29.542
Gruffalo Buffalo has joined the mix.
Three o'clock.

362
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:40.375
- Oh. excuse me.
- Oh no. sorry.

363
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.917
- I am so sorry.
- Here. let me just. oh nope-

364
00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:45.500
That belongs to you. I apologize.

365
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.042
Oh gosh. he hates me.

366
00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:50.458
- Here.
- Ah. you're my hero.

367
00:23:50.658 --> 00:23:54.000
Well. I just like to be prepared for
any possible scenario.

368
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.500
Which is not a weird thing to say at a party.

369
00:23:56.875 --> 00:24:00.125
Well. I just mopped a spill
with that guy's tail. so...

370
00:24:01.042 --> 00:24:02.042
Paw!

371
00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:05.958
Pawbert! I am Pawbert! Hi.

372
00:24:06.158 --> 00:24:10.000
- Judy. I'm Judy Hopps.
- Ah. what the pork?

373
00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:12.125
Well. 'tis nice to meet you Judy-

374
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:14.500
Wait. Judy Hopps. the Judy Hopps?

375
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.200
Are you working this?

376
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.080
I mean. you're clearly working it.

377
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.440
But are you actually working this?

378
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.815
No. I'm actually...

379
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.975
Well. it's just a hunch.

380
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.520
Protecting that.

381
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.590
Good.
I don't think it has enough guards.

382
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:30.880
Uh. that was my joke.

383
00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:32.840
And there's nothing here.

384
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.080
Let's call it a night.
Hopps?

385
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.975
Well. we should...

386
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.615
It was nice to meet you.

387
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.760
Yes. and you?

388
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.040
Bon appétit.

389
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.095
If at any point tonight you
choose to eat. bon appétit then.

390
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.840
You're supposed to be off stage. Pawbert.

391
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.055
- Yeah. get off stage. Pawbert.
- Wait are-

392
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.535
Are you?

393
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.735
Yeah. I am a Lynxley.
or. you know. I'm trying to be.

394
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.015
Now. Pawbert.
Come on. pappy.

395
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.255
I got you. Pa. don't you worry.

396
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.255
No. I have him.

397
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.960
All right. let's get this thing started.

398
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.815
- Welcome to the Zootennial Gala.
- Hey. Hopps.

399
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.640
I think I might actually...

400
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.920
I think I've got something.

401
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.520
Look at you all.

402
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.400
Good to see you.

403
00:25:24.833 --> 00:25:29.333
It is with great pleasure that I introduce
the third generation...

404
00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:31.735
Carrots. can you hear me?
I have a trail.

405
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.167
The legacy of our great
city. Milton Lynxley.

406
00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:37.875
- Thank you.
- Carrots.

407
00:25:37.983 --> 00:25:39.480
- Thank you very much.
- Carrots!

408
00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:42.455
What are you doing here?

409
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.815
- Chief. she was right.
- You're done.

410
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.855
You're both done.

411
00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:50.000
My grandpa had a dream
to build a city for all of us...

412
00:25:50.083 --> 00:25:50.625
Nick?

413
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.542
To truly be better together.

414
00:26:05.917 --> 00:26:07.125
There's a snake!

415
00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:10.292
Go. go!

416
00:26:10.492 --> 00:26:12.208
I will remember you. zebra!

417
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:36.875
Judy! Judy!

418
00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.042
I knew it!

419
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.680
Stop!

420
00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:05.480
Please. you don't have to hurt him.

421
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.680
Hurt him?

422
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.458
Snakes never hurt anyone.

423
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.560
We aren't the bad guys.

424
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.080
They are.

425
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.040
And this journal
holds the secret that will prove it.

426
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.400
I have to prove it.
Please.

427
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.440
This is our only chance to set things right.

428
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:38.560
And when I do. my family
will finally be able to come home.

429
00:27:39.583 --> 00:27:40.625
Oh no!

430
00:27:40.758 --> 00:27:41.827
I am here!

431
00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.120
Hopps and Wilde. dream team.
We got him.

432
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.880
Or her.
Reptiles. it's like. who knows?

433
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.400
The cops are right behind us.

434
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.120
Kill the snake.

435
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.575
We'll burn the journal.

436
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.920
If he wants it. it's dangerous.

437
00:27:58.917 --> 00:28:04.237
And then you two will file a report that he
attacked us. and you will

438
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.280
keep your mouths shut.

439
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.480
Step aside.

440
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.640
Put out the fire!

441
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.695
- Carrots. come on!
- Help me save him!

442
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720
- Carrots. we need-
- Nick!

443
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.840
Cold!
Cold!

444
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:30.833
Chief!

445
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.215
He'll be okay.
Anti-venom.

446
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.280
- He can be saved with anti-venom.
- Hopps!

447
00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.895
What did you do?

448
00:28:37.708 --> 00:28:38.655
They're helping the snake.

449
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.880
They're trying to kill the chief.

450
00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:41.000
Hoggbottom. no. please-

451
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.055
My page.
Let's go.

452
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.255
I need the journal!

453
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.680
And probably a sweater.

454
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.000
Cold!

455
00:28:57.083 --> 00:28:58.625
Next time. we stay home?

456
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.895
No. stop them!

457
00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:06.750
- Wait!
- Come on. come on.

458
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:07.960
Stop.

459
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:15.655
- <i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>
- Accident.

460
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.200
Your words. not mine.

461
00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:28.000
Put 'em in the trunk.

462
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.040
What?

463
00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:42.080
Terroar in Tundratown.

464
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.480
A fanging at the fiesta.

465
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.135
A hooowl at the gala as a venomous snake
attacks the founding family.

466
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.542
More shocking.
the snake was aided by embattled ZPD officers

467
00:29:51.625 --> 00:29:53.357
Nicholas Wilde and Judy Hopps.

468
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.695
All three now suspects in the tragic
fanging of Zootopia's chief of police

469
00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.800
and considered extremely dangerous.

470
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.320
Chief Bogo is dead.

471
00:30:06.458 --> 00:30:08.120
Those are words I'm glad I don't have to say.

472
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.375
I might have to soon

473
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.280
the doctor is a little weirded out.
but what has happened tonight

474
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.640
was more than horseplay.

475
00:30:23.042 --> 00:30:25.000
We're going to take that snake down.

476
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.120
And the fox and that rabbit.

477
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.083
Do you know how many
mayors they've already destroyed?

478
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.160
One... Two...

479
00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:39.280
I got up to two.

480
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.360
Would you like to be three?

481
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.720
I want them gone.

482
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.360
But aren't there laws?

483
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.840
I will say this once. Brian.

484
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.560
You will retrieve the journal
and bury them.

485
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.360
Or maybe I chose the wrong mayor.

486
00:31:06.917 --> 00:31:09.840
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

487
00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:05.055
Hey. the phone
is the first thing they'll track.

488
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.083
Sorry.

489
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.840
I have never been on the run
from the law before.

490
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.320
Yeah. boy.

491
00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.640
It's almost like we shouldn't
have gone to that gala.

492
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.215
Okay. we already did it your way.

493
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.535
With Mr. Big. we do it mine.

494
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.600
This is where having a partner from the
underworld is really gonna pay off.

495
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.680
Raymond.
And is that Kev-

496
00:32:53.458 --> 00:32:55.833
Welcome to my warehouse!

497
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.792
Oh my God. I love your dress!

498
00:32:57.992 --> 00:32:59.375
Oh. thank you.

499
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.160
Fru Fru and I are now
equal partners in the family business.

500
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.600
She brings wonderful ideas for crime
and for fashion

501
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.080
while I get more time to focus
on what matters most.

502
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.615
being grandpapa to my little Judith.

503
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.440
Kiss my ring.

504
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.360
- Kiss the stinking ring right now.
- Kiss it right now!

505
00:33:23.375 --> 00:33:28.535
Nonno. you said we were going to make
some nice shoes for Mr. Weaselton.

506
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.575
- That's my girl!
- They grow up so fast.

507
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.292
- You run your mouth too much!
- Shut your mouth. fox!

508
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:41.040
Anyways. you're in trouble. and we like...
one of yous. so we're here to help.

509
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.680
New clothes. new identities.
truck out of town. leave in an hour.

510
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.260
and your meter maid car is taken care of.

511
00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:53.080
I think you misunderstand.

512
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.815
We've been framed by the lynxes
and an innocent snake-

513
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:02.400
Judy. the lynxes are killers.
and they have no honor.

514
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.000
And this Tundratown expansion
only makes them more dangerous.

515
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.400
Territorial animals will
do anything for more land.

516
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.520
So if whatever you're tangled up in.
threatens their plans. you're dead.

517
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.520
You don't fight the cats.

518
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400
You leave.

519
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.935
Sir. I know you're trying to look out
for us. but we took an oath to protect

520
00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.535
this city. and justice doesn't run.

521
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.360
On behalf of myself.
Rick Wilde and Ms. Trudy Cabbagepatch.

522
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.520
We thank you for your truck to salvation.

523
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.255
We cannot accept your offer.

524
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.520
We are helping that snake.

525
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.760
Boy. you're really
tossing that 'we' around.

526
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.680
Snakes may have been framed
for the fanging of that tortoise.

527
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.760
Do you have any idea why or
how this book could prove it?

528
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.960
I wish I did.

529
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.040
But if it has to do with snakes.
your best bet is talking to a reptile.

530
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.720
Do you know any?

531
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.800
Almost no one does.

532
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.840
They keep to themselves.
hide out in Marsh Market.

533
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.415
But you can still find them.

534
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.400
You just need a reptile expert.
someone local who knows where to go.

535
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.640
Lucky for you. I met someone.

536
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.760
- She runs a podcast.
- No. no.

537
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Trudy Cabbagepatch.

538
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.640
Rick Wilde says no.

539
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.080
Oh. yeah!

540
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.975
Hopps and Wilde are on the land.

541
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.600
Subtle sleuthing. 'tis my jam!

542
00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:33.400
Mind the splinters.
Oh. you called the right beaver.

543
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.535
If you want to talk to a reptile.
I am your gal.

544
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.160
Also. if you need to talk to a jackalope.
which are real. mom.

545
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.520
Excuse us.
Team meeting.

546
00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.917
Vetoing the beave. new vote

547
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.208
all in favor of 'truck to being alive
and laying low till this blows over'-bill?

548
00:35:49.958 --> 00:35:50.625
I mean...

549
00:35:50.825 --> 00:35:52.417
Hopps and Wilde do not bail on a case.

550
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.333
But she's crazy.

551
00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:56.033
Probably lead poisoning
from eating too many pencils.

552
00:35:59.208 --> 00:36:01.083
Do you know a reptile who can tell
us the hidden secret in here

553
00:36:01.167 --> 00:36:02.583
why the lynxes framed the snakes?

554
00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:06.542
24 hours. Sunrise tomorrow.

555
00:36:06.742 --> 00:36:10.417
If we strike out. then we go into hiding.
and Judy Cabbagepatch it is.

556
00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:15.667
It's Trudy Cabbagepatch.
and the safe word is "coconut."

557
00:36:15.792 --> 00:36:19.583
In the darkness. of a dank underpass.
they stepped into the vehicle

558
00:36:19.667 --> 00:36:22.680
not realizing
their lives were about to change.

559
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.055
Because we're going to meet our reptile?

560
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.560
Because you're about to be
best buds with Nibbles Maplestick!

561
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.880
Takes two to tango.
but a threesome to be some.

562
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.500
Let's find you a reptile and
rock the swamp!

563
00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:47.292
Breathe it in!

564
00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:54.833
Now if any reptile would know
the secret of that book

565
00:36:54.917 --> 00:36:56.042
and why the snake wants it..

566
00:36:56.125 --> 00:36:56.833
Hey. Johnny.

567
00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:00.042
It's my lizard friend Jesús.

568
00:37:00.169 --> 00:37:03.360
Why would a lizard hide here?

569
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.815
Well. when Zootopia was founded.
the whole neighborhood got cut

570
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.200
off from the rest of the town.

571
00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:11.680
Kind of on our own here.

572
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.695
Yeah. it's probably why reptiles like it.

573
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.320
They can just do their thing.

574
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.000
Plus. it's the only place in town you can
get away with wearing

575
00:37:19.025 --> 00:37:20.680
a shirt and no pants.

576
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.042
Loving tour time with Woodchuckles.
Great call.

577
00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.095
- We need her.
- Oh. yeah.

578
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.000
Like a hole in the head.
Bad timing.

579
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.040
Okay. to get to Jesús' hideout.
we gotta take a ferry.

580
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.695
Just let me handle the locals.

581
00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.415
Water folk tend to be a little
stand-offish around landies.

582
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.840
Well. I've been hustling
the streets since I was twelve.

583
00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:43.200
I think I can handle a juggling seal.

584
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.680
Sea lion.

585
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.160
He's not from around here.

586
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.520
But coin's a coin.

587
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.080
Oh. no. change..

588
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.575
...is a choking hazard.

589
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.080
Well. honest mistake.

590
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.975
Do not do that.

591
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.440
Let's let Nibbles handle this.

592
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.975
Thank you. Judith.

593
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.560
Conversing with these
beautiful sea creatures

594
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.667
is like talking to anyone a little different.

595
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.458
Just takes open and
respectful communication.

596
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:19.708
- Hey Bub.
- Hey Bub.

597
00:38:19.792 --> 00:38:21.367
- Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub.
- Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub.

598
00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:22.750
- Hey Bub.
- Hey Bub.

599
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.125
- Hey Bub. Bubbybub.
- Hey Bub. hey Bub.

600
00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:26.325
- Hey Bub. Bub.
- Hey Bub.

601
00:38:27.292 --> 00:38:28.792
- Seen Jesús?
- Yup.

602
00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:37.958
And now. we leave town.

603
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.208
Thank you for this.

604
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.333
Happy anniversary.

605
00:38:56.533 --> 00:38:58.875
Oh? It's your anniversary?

606
00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:02.895
♪ This is the night ♪

607
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:11.167
♪ It's a beautiful night.
and we call it bella notte ♪

608
00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:20.040
How are we going to find them now?

609
00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.083
Thanks. seal.

610
00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

611
00:39:34.125 --> 00:39:35.751
Just a little farther.

612
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:40.335
Jesús and all the answers you'll
ever need are right here at the end

613
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.511
of this very scary dark hallway.

614
00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:47.015
Boy. this is so much better than
sitting on a beach on Outback Island

615
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.800
sipping piña koalas.

616
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:54.495
We are not skipping town when there is
an innocent snake out there who needs us.

617
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.000
He's got help.

618
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.840
His motorcycle buddy.

619
00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:00.415
You are acting weird.

620
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440
What is your problem?

621
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.680
Well. A. you railroaded me. and B.
if you must know.

622
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.875
I have an aversion to reptiles.

623
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:12.880
What?

624
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.917
Oh. is my discomfort hilarious to you?

625
00:40:17.117 --> 00:40:18.625
Y-No. you- 
I'm sorry. you're right.

626
00:40:18.825 --> 00:40:21.333
We are partners.
and whenever I'm uncomfortable

627
00:40:21.417 --> 00:40:23.958
you are always every considerate
of my feelings.

628
00:40:24.042 --> 00:40:25.042
Look out. snake skin!

629
00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:27.575
I'm slipping. I'm slipping.
I'm slipping. hold the rail!

630
00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.775
- Hold the rail. hold it. hold it.
- I'm holding it.

631
00:40:28.858 --> 00:40:30.208
- Stop holding my ears!
- Hold it. hold it!

632
00:40:30.292 --> 00:40:32.542
- Never pull a bunny's ears!
- Hold the rail!

633
00:40:35.875 --> 00:40:37.958
I think the real mystery

634
00:40:38.375 --> 00:40:40.542
is how you two ever solved anything!

635
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.560
Anywho. let's see what Jesús
has to say about your journal.

636
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.042
Oh. and if he offers you food. accept.

637
00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:51.208
Declining is a sign of disrespect.
To all of them.

638
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:53.042
All of them?

639
00:41:17.417 --> 00:41:18.417
Order up.

640
00:41:20.208 --> 00:41:21.333
Hey. another drink.

641
00:41:28.417 --> 00:41:29.417
So warm.

642
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.583
Whoops.

643
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:38.625
Keep it.

644
00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:44.208
Jesús!

645
00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:46.917
Allow me to introduce my friends

646
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.542
this is Judith and Nicholas

647
00:41:48.742 --> 00:41:51.792
they are wanted fugitives
investigating a snake mystery

648
00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:54.542
and trying not to get murdered.
May we sit?

649
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.333
Okay.

650
00:42:06.292 --> 00:42:08.417
Oh I'm good. but these guys look hungry.

651
00:42:12.792 --> 00:42:14.333
Thank you for meeting with us.

652
00:42:14.417 --> 00:42:17.625
We believe snakes were framed
for something in this journal

653
00:42:17.825 --> 00:42:19.875
- perhaps pertaining to-
- Eat first.

654
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.625
Talk second.

655
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:01.792
Hey guys. they ate it!

656
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:04.333
Look at their faces!

657
00:43:05.167 --> 00:43:06.708
I don't eat grubs.

658
00:43:06.908 --> 00:43:08.833
Hermano. get me a scone.

659
00:43:10.208 --> 00:43:11.458
Okay. okay.

660
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:15.880
Metal cover.

661
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.800
And what does that mean?

662
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.360
It means it's fancy.

663
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.840
It also means the secret you're looking
for is probably right on the cover.

664
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.440
Somehow vipers can see things
in the middle. even under the paint.

665
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.040
This is Ebonezer Lynxley's
original journal for the weather walls.

666
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.800
Why would he hide a secret for a snake?

667
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:48.400
I don't know. but it must have been big
cause a tortoise died for it.

668
00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.240
I am guessing that it was a slow death.

669
00:43:55.958 --> 00:43:59.360
The fanging didn't just
change how folks saw snakes.

670
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.480
No mammals trusted any reptile after that.

671
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.000
That's why we all left.

672
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.360
And that's when the Lynxleys
expanded Tundratown the first time.

673
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.280
And it's happening again.

674
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.160
The expansion is going here.

675
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.720
Marsh Market will be buried in snow.

676
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.680
We'll all get pushed out.

677
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.680
Those lynxes will get more land.
and there's no way to stop them.

678
00:44:38.667 --> 00:44:41.840
What if the secret hidden in here could?

679
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.240
Then I would say holding it puts
the two of you in grave danger.

680
00:44:57.542 --> 00:44:59.083
They tracked you?

681
00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:01.708
Whoops.

682
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.815
It's the ZPD!

683
00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:11.295
Follow me.

684
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.440
Come on.

685
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.000
Wait. why are you helping us?

686
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.120
You two saved this city once.

687
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.360
I reckon you can save it again.

688
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.840
And when you do. maybe everyone
will see we ain't that different.

689
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:32.833
Huh.

690
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.295
I'm really sorry. but this is
my family's only chance to come home.

691
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.542
Wait. we want to help.

692
00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:41.958
Wait. wait.

693
00:45:42.917 --> 00:45:43.875
Come back!

694
00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.458
There's no path.
Take the docks.

695
00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:48.250
Carrots!

696
00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:49.815
Wait!
We believe you.

697
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.250
Nick. come on. come on.

698
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.250
Grab it.

699
00:46:10.083 --> 00:46:11.255
I got eyes on them.

700
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.400
- They're heading for the tubes!
- In pursuit.

701
00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:49.175
One tip.

702
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.680
If he goes for the red
line. do not follow.

703
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.255
You will run out of air.
Good luck.

704
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.455
I love you.

705
00:47:04.417 --> 00:47:05.458
Cannonball!

706
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.575
No. that's a red line.
Red line. red line.

707
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.760
You're going to run out of air!

708
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:12.200
Coconut. coconut!

709
00:47:32.792 --> 00:47:34.615
Anything you need. I got them.

710
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.375
Sequels. prequels. requels.

711
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.640
Who says the industry's
going down the tube?

712
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

713
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.040
Yes.

714
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.520
You?

715
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.880
Well. I-I feel like some...

716
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.800
Some sorries may be in order.

717
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.160
Nick. it's okay.

718
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.040
I know you didn't want
to lose him on purpose.

719
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.080
Oh. not me sorry.
No. no.

720
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.520
You sorry.

721
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:58.680
Well. now we kinda have no way to find
him or stop the lynxes. so...

722
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.280
Agree to disagree.

723
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.520
But we are alive.

724
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.240
So if we can't find him. that's great.

725
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.333
What we can find is a truck out of here.

726
00:49:22.958 --> 00:49:25.360
Box of old matches.
Helpful.

727
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.320
Trudy Cabbagepatch. leaving town.
We're done.

728
00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.375
Yodelay hee-hoo!

729
00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:35.292
- This is weird place for you to be.
- Ja. very weird.

730
00:49:35.583 --> 00:49:37.250
You there fell out of the tube.

731
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.042
Okay. we will call police to help.

732
00:49:39.125 --> 00:49:40.500
No! No. no. we're fine.

733
00:49:40.745 --> 00:49:42.600
Yeah. but we were just leaving town.

734
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.417
Actually. um. do you
happen to know where this tube goes?

735
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.583
- Copenhoofen.
- Ja. is Copenhoofen.

736
00:49:49.783 --> 00:49:50.783
Got it. thank y-

737
00:49:50.983 --> 00:49:53.708
Ah. you chew too much.
this is not-

738
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.625
Where did- Where did
you find these flowers?

739
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.458
Oh. the Liebchen flower?
At the tippity-top of the mountain.

740
00:50:04.658 --> 00:50:06.125
This is only place they grow.

741
00:50:09.625 --> 00:50:13.042
- Is there anything else up there?
- Nope. there sure isn't.

742
00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:15.037
Oh ja. old Honeymoon Lodge.

743
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.960
What is closed for a long
time was hideout for snakes.

744
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.320
Honeymoon Lodge?

745
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.520
How- How do you reach it?

746
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.083
- Oh. tourist takes the tram from Copenhoofen.
- But the rope is faster.

747
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.215
Good luck.

748
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.840
- Have fun at the Honeymoon Lodge!
- Thank you.

749
00:50:40.875 --> 00:50:44.292
What does this secret have to do
with the reptiles leaving town?

750
00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:48.208
How did it get hidden in
the journal in the first place?

751
00:50:48.408 --> 00:50:49.708
Will you slow down?

752
00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:54.667
How long do you think it's gonna be
before Hoggbottom and the ZPD

753
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:55.875
figure out where we are?

754
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.708
If anything. we should be going faster.

755
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:01.417
As a always say...

756
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.417
"I really am just a dumb bunny."

757
00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:05.792
Nick...

758
00:51:06.417 --> 00:51:10.208
"I-I-I-really am du-du-du-
dumb bunny."

759
00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:12.458
"Just dumb-du-du-du-dumb bunny"

760
00:51:12.542 --> 00:51:13.625
This was a gift.

761
00:51:13.825 --> 00:51:15.671
To symbolize our partnership.

762
00:51:15.833 --> 00:51:18.280
And it is not
appropriate for this moment.

763
00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:19.375
Oh. no. I was just-

764
00:51:20.167 --> 00:51:22.917
Hoping to jot down some ideas
for what we will put

765
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.792
on our tombstones.
I'll start.

766
00:51:24.992 --> 00:51:26.375
"His partner did it."

767
00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:29.458
What happened to you that you can't
just have a normal conversation?

768
00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.280
I will save that for my therapy animal.

769
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.680
Yeah. you need a therapy animal.

770
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:42.360
Well. you need a herd of therapy animals.

771
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.458
Yeah. you need a whole
migration of therapy animals.

772
00:52:20.292 --> 00:52:21.125
Carrots?

773
00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:06.667
Hey. Carrots?

774
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.083
Uh. Carrots?

775
00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:57.042
Carrots!

776
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:29.667
There was a whole reptile neighborhood.

777
00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:33.417
Their home.

778
00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:38.542
The lynxes just erased it.

779
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:40.958
This is what they do.

780
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:43.625
We have to go.

781
00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:47.083
They push the animals out with lies
so they can have more.

782
00:54:47.167 --> 00:54:48.333
We gotta go. Carrots.
we gotta go!

783
00:54:48.417 --> 00:54:49.500
That's what the snake's trying to prove!

784
00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:52.708
- The ZPD is here.
- What?

785
00:54:53.417 --> 00:54:55.542
No. they won't believe us.
Not without proof.

786
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:59.333
Leave it! They aren't gonna just arrest us.
the lynxes want us dead!

787
00:54:59.417 --> 00:55:01.000
We need it. to solve the case.

788
00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:03.333
- Judy. just-
- We have to solve the case!

789
00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:05.833
- Nick!
- I don't care about the case!

790
00:55:08.167 --> 00:55:09.917
Judy. it's not worth dying for.

791
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.880
The world will never be
a better place if no one is

792
00:55:16.905 --> 00:55:18.600
brave enough to do the right thing.

793
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.855
The world is what it is. Carrots.

794
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.943
And sometimes. being a hero

795
00:55:25.125 --> 00:55:28.167
it just doesn't make a difference.

796
00:55:35.667 --> 00:55:36.792
I think. uh...

797
00:55:39.542 --> 00:55:40.542
I think...

798
00:55:41.583 --> 00:55:43.208
Maybe. maybe we...

799
00:55:46.417 --> 00:55:47.583
are different.

800
00:56:23.833 --> 00:56:25.667
Oh my gosh. I think I just took out a cop.

801
00:56:25.958 --> 00:56:27.542
Uh. sorry sir!

802
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:28.458
Pawbert?

803
00:56:28.542 --> 00:56:29.874
Yeah. it's. you know...

804
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.480
We're the good guys.
I told you she's helping.

805
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:39.040
Come with us!

806
00:56:41.417 --> 00:56:42.615
We have the fox.

807
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.120
We have the fox!

808
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.800
They already have your partner.

809
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.175
They can't get you too.

810
00:56:49.833 --> 00:56:50.560
Please.

811
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.440
We can stop my family.

812
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.800
Judy.

813
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880
No. no. no.

814
00:57:29.875 --> 00:57:30.875
Here we go.

815
00:57:57.875 --> 00:57:59.125
You're not dead!

816
00:58:00.417 --> 00:58:01.417
She's not dead!

817
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:04.000
Sorry! Sorry.

818
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.360
I just got my motorcycle license.

819
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.080
Nick?

820
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:14.080
They. they caught him.

821
00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:21.360
But out here. no one's gonna catch us.

822
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.880
Mayor Winddancer.

823
00:58:34.792 --> 00:58:35.840
Where's the bunny?

824
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.440
I don't know.

825
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.120
But you know. she's a rabbit.
so maybe you can pull her out of your hat.

826
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.680
I'm not wearing a hat.

827
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.135
He's messing with you. sir.

828
00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.960
I knew that.
Get him out of here.

829
00:58:54.375 --> 00:58:56.640
Where are they. Mr. Wilde?

830
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.360
Begin the expansion.

831
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.292
Freeze Marsh Market. flush everyone out.

832
00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:05.208
No. you ca-

833
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:10.295
Water folk. like foxes.
are lesser mammals.

834
00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:16.095
If I say they helped a dangerous snake.
no one will care what we do.

835
00:59:17.625 --> 00:59:20.520
You're going to a dark cell. Mr. Wilde.

836
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.920
Just long enough to read the headline
of your partner's demise.

837
00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.680
You should have left town
when you had the chance.

838
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.120
Dad.

839
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:42.560
Fur.

840
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.360
From whoever's helping
the bunny and the snake.

841
00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:49.375
Find Pawbert.

842
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.880
Almost to me hideout.

843
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.625
- Snake in the hole.
- Yeah. yeah.

844
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.280
We shall succeed. Judy Hopps.

845
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.000
We'll stop the Lynxleys
and save your partner.

846
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.800
I'm sorry.
You are...

847
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.240
Gary.
Gary De'Snake.

848
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.760
- And your last name?
- De'Snake.

849
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:20.599
Everything is gonna be okay.

850
01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:29.302
Teaming up
with you is very exciting!

851
01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:31.535
Don't worry about my fang.

852
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.015
I got my own anti-venom pen.

853
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.240
Stops the toxin.

854
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.255
<i>Stab me straight into the heart!</i>

855
01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.840
Welcome to my oasis.

856
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.960
Away from my evil family.

857
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.280
I like to come here. just kinda
veg out. get with all my cat stuff.

858
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.880
No. that's actually vintage.

859
01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:57.000
You could just not...

860
01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.080
No. no. please don't.

861
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.535
Wow. mammals get the best stuff!

862
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.840
No! Not that.

863
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.042
Turn it off. turn it off.
turn it off. turn it off.

864
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.960
So we should probably get to the journal.

865
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.655
How did you become partners?

866
01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:19.280
When I found out the journal was gonna
be on display at the gala.

867
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.960
I sent his family an anonymous
letter asking to see it.

868
01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.880
Luckily. they make Pawbert work
in the mail room. so he read it first.

869
01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.440
I got him smuggled in from overseas.

870
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.400
Seven days in a crate.

871
01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:36.160
But if I fix things for my family.
it'll be worth it.

872
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.560
Then we'll fix things
for your partner. too.

873
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:51.000
Hey. I know coming with us was hard.
but we're gonna help your partner

874
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.800
the same way we're going to help the city.

875
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.680
We stop my family and show
everyone the truth.

876
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.200
Are you ready?

877
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.960
Light the fire.

878
01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:14.680
How much do you know?

879
01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:16.083
Well...

880
01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:19.208
That his family was framed.

881
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.958
And there's some secret
hidden in the metal cover

882
01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:24.458
that only a snake can see.

883
01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.750
Not just any snake.

884
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:29.833
A heat-sensing pit viper.

885
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.500
All it takes is a little warmth.

886
01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:35.833
I just don-

887
01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:37.458
I don't understand.

888
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:42.042
Why would your great-grandfather
hide a secret for a snake?

889
01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:44.708
He didn't.

890
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:45.960
I...

891
01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.680
It wasn't his journal.

892
01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:54.800
That's the secret.

893
01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:58.920
Zootopia wasn't created by a mammal.

894
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.458
It was created by a snake.

895
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.208
Gary's great-grandmother.

896
01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:12.320
She wanted to make the city a place
where all animals felt welcome.

897
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So she invented her weather
walls to help everyone.

898
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:29.960
She just needed an investor. a partner.

899
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.360
But when my great-grandfather saw what her
idea could be worth.

900
01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.000
he plotted to steal her plans for himself.

901
01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:53.040
So he committed a murder.

902
01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.360
His own maid.

903
01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:02.840
And framed Gary's great-grandmother.

904
01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:09.280
And because she was a snake.
everyone believed his lie.

905
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:11.947
Soon.

906
01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:15.480
no reptiles were welcome.

907
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.333
And over time.

908
01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:25.320
my great-grandfather
buried the reptile neighborhood in snow.

909
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.680
And he died. believing no one
could ever uncover his crimes.

910
01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:36.800
But...

911
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.640
He was wrong.

912
01:04:43.833 --> 01:04:45.200
Her original patent

913
01:04:46.417 --> 01:04:47.560
was saved.

914
01:04:49.042 --> 01:04:50.520
That's what you're looking for.

915
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.320
She hid it in her home.

916
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.440
Find her home. find her patent.

917
01:05:05.917 --> 01:05:12.480
We just didn't know where her
home was buried until now.

918
01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.520
My family's land?

919
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.840
But under all that snow. how
are we going to find it?

920
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.040
Wait.
Clock tower.

921
01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.000
Her neighborhood. the reptile
neighborhood. had a clock tower.

922
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.720
It lights up like a beacon.

923
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.295
If it wasn't fully buried.
maybe we could see it.

924
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.095
Follow it to her home.

925
01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.320
Except my great-grandfather
turned off the power.

926
01:05:37.345 --> 01:05:40.960
But we have the plans that show
us how to turn it back on.

927
01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:46.440
The power switch to her
whole neighborhood was in...

928
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.440
- The original control room.
- All right.

929
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.080
And where is that?

930
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.000
Inside the oldest wall of the city.
the Desert-Tundratown weather wall.

931
01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:02.200
We get inside. turn on that switch.
light the clock tower - we find her house.

932
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.055
We find her patent.

933
01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.120
And my family is finally coming home.

934
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.455
We will succeed. Judy Hopps.

935
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.960
We shall succeed!

936
01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:16.240
I found him.

937
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.320
Get me Hoggbottom.

938
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.095
It's Nicholas Wilde.

939
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.655
Big time cop. huh?

940
01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.800
I'll see you at the lunch table.

941
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.667
I'm gonna tie your tail in a knot!

942
01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:35.600
- Hoggbottom?
- What are you looking at. butt head?

943
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.975
This is a mistake.
It's a setup.

944
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.135
It's the lynxes.

945
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.800
Listen to me. please.

946
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.800
I know we have had our differences. right?

947
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.600
But I've always respected you.

948
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.375
You don't respect anyone.

949
01:06:52.792 --> 01:06:54.542
It's Milton Lynxley.

950
01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:56.917
he's got the rabbit's location.

951
01:06:57.117 --> 01:06:59.458
Whatever he says. it's a lie. Hoggbottom.

952
01:06:59.658 --> 01:07:01.083
Hoggbottom. listen to me!

953
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.917
Nicholas Wilde!

954
01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:13.167
What are the chances!

955
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.720
You know. this is my first time in prison.

956
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.960
And I got to say. their food is on point.

957
01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:23.720
How are you even here?

958
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.440
Destiny. plus an arrest.

959
01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.480
But it looks like Judith got away.

960
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.120
Was that decision mutual?

961
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.600
Oh. sensing in trouble in paradise.

962
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.015
Want to talk about it?

963
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.360
What I want is to get out of here.

964
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.895
Right. your big plan.

965
01:07:42.978 --> 01:07:46.250
Lay low on Outback Island
sipping piña koalas.

966
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.440
Except you can't trust koalas
cause they got four thumbs.

967
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.800
Did a whole episode
about it on the podcast.

968
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.880
It was called They Got Four Thumbs.
But you know what?

969
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.375
At least they ain't platypuses.

970
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:59.920
Wait. can you just. can you
please just let me concentrate?

971
01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.200
Roger that.

972
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.160
Just talk to me. dude.

973
01:08:09.708 --> 01:08:12.240
What's the last thing she said to you?

974
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.792
She. um. she said.

975
01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:20.600
"Maybe we are too different."

976
01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:24.240
And what did you say before that?

977
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.440
I said the case isn't worth dying for.

978
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.167
Like...
Like. you know.

979
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:35.400
as in it isn't worth
her dying for because...

980
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.560
Because solitary animals like
me don't have real friends.

981
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680
And I...
I...

982
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.420
I don't want to lose her.

983
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.960
So. I just...

984
01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:51.920
I don't know how to say that.

985
01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:55.320
You know what. bud?

986
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.000
I think you just did.

987
01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.680
Wait. how'd you do that?

988
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.160
Well. I open my arms. put them
around you. and then I squeeze.

989
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.600
It's called a hug.

990
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.320
Do foxes not have hugs?

991
01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:09.875
Oh. the lock.

992
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.560
Yeah. that's Beave 101.

993
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.080
The rabbit's in Desert Dunes!

994
01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.108
- Roll out!
- Roll out!

995
01:09:16.583 --> 01:09:19.625
Your partner needs you.
and Nibbles Maplestick

996
01:09:19.708 --> 01:09:21.120
is gonna get you to her.

997
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.640
Hey. it's the fox dad!

998
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.255
- And the woodchuck!
- Woodchuck?

999
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.240
I'm a beaver!
Call me that again-

1000
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.535
Okay. go!
We gotta go.

1001
01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.125
Here we go.

1002
01:09:35.958 --> 01:09:37.400
Hello. Nicholas.

1003
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.480
I hope you like my new home.

1004
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.720
I wove it with my own wool.

1005
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.360
Jump scare!

1006
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.208
Adios!

1007
01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.458
Wheels.
We need wheels.

1008
01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:09.917
No. no. no. no!

1009
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500
I'm sorry.

1010
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.417
I do not think we can get to Judy
in time to help.

1011
01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:15.917
Unless...

1012
01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:20.500
You happen to know the fastest
driver in the history of Zootopia?

1013
01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:39.333
Hey. Flash. Flash. 100-yard dash!

1014
01:10:39.417 --> 01:10:42.250
Partner's in trouble. need to
get across town. ignore the laws.

1015
01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.458
No...

1016
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.125
problem.

1017
01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.640
Let's hit it.

1018
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.400
Hey. glad you're here.

1019
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.958
I got to tell you. I'm not convinced
a sloth is our most reliable-

1020
01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:05.695
To turn on the clock tower. and light the way

1021
01:11:05.792 --> 01:11:08.702
to your great-grandma's home so we can
find her patent. we need to reach

1022
01:11:08.785 --> 01:11:10.560
the power control room. through here.

1023
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.167
But we have to move quickly
or we're never going to-

1024
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:14.400
We shall succeed. Judy Hopps.

1025
01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.135
Look. Gary. if we don't overprepare.
we're underprepared.

1026
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.840
And I don't...

1027
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.240
My family has been trying to prove we're
not what everyone thinks for 100 years.

1028
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.215
But even this close.
they never want me to put the weight

1029
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.375
of the world on my shoulders.
because. I don't have any shoulders.

1030
01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:35.080
We shall succeed.

1031
01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.000
I got you. rabbit.

1032
01:11:43.292 --> 01:11:47.175
I cannot help Judy if I don't know where
she is. which is why I need you to get

1033
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.335
on Paul's computer and track Hoggbottom.

1034
01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.840
You are an escaped fugitive.

1035
01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.935
I could get fired for even talking to you!

1036
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.680
They're gonna put her to sleep!
Do it!

1037
01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.280
Okay.

1038
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.960
Did you try restarting it?
Mm-hmm.

1039
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.600
- Have you tried not being an idiot?
- Hey. Paul.

1040
01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.360
I got you some donuts-

1041
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.295
- Oh. no.
- Thanks. Clawhauser.

1042
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.000
Clawhauser!
Location.

1043
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.960
Oh. no.

1044
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.500
I think we're gonna have
to go through the festival.

1045
01:12:17.525 --> 01:12:18.600
Festival?

1046
01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:25.880
The phone's the first thing they track.

1047
01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.833
Go. go!

1048
01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:33.292
- Clawhauser!
- I am working on it!

1049
01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:35.542
- Got it!
- Great! Great. great.

1050
01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:36.708
- Now...
- No!

1051
01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.125
What festival is this?

1052
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.120
- Come on!
- Go. go. go!

1053
01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.040
We are with you. Judy Hopps.

1054
01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:11.440
We meet again. zebra.

1055
01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:15.400

1056
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.680
She's going for the door.

1057
01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.415
She's going for the door!

1058
01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:23.760
Clawhauser. we're out of time!

1059
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.417
I got it!

1060
01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:27.792
Desert-Tundratown weather wall.
access door.

1061
01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:30.333
Desert-Tundratown weather wall
access door. hurry!

1062
01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:32.815
What is in that wall?

1063
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.855
A power control room.

1064
01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.655
For... like some
old part of Tundratown.

1065
01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:38.615
I know what they're doing.

1066
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.880
They'll ruin us!

1067
01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:44.735
No more tranquilizers!

1068
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.415
- Put them down.
- Sir?

1069
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.800
Put them down now!

1070
01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.480
Take the shot.

1071
01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.560
Take the shot!

1072
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.720
Do it!

1073
01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:25.125
Judy!

1074
01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.333
Power control room?

1075
01:14:32.533 --> 01:14:34.792
Uh. five flights up.
Come on. hurry!

1076
01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:37.708
There is a lot of stairs.

1077
01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:42.292
Way to hustle. bud.
I love you. I owe you!

1078
01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:46.625
It's turning on.
It's turning on!

1079
01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:50.375
Nibbles?

1080
01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:55.667
Nibbles!

1081
01:14:58.167 --> 01:14:59.083
Snake!

1082
01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:01.667
Cold!

1083
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.680
- It's jammed.
- Don't worry about me.

1084
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.120
Find the switch.

1085
01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:09.333
No. no. no. no. not these.

1086
01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:11.000
It would be...

1087
01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:12.167
Older.

1088
01:15:29.042 --> 01:15:30.042
Can you see it?

1089
01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:32.583
Did we turn on the clock tower?

1090
01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:37.000
There.

1091
01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.167
It's there.

1092
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.167
We did it.

1093
01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.583
We can find the original patent.

1094
01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:50.125
Nick?

1095
01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:52.167
The door.

1096
01:15:52.367 --> 01:15:53.367
It's locked. Wait...

1097
01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:54.792
How did it lock?

1098
01:15:54.992 --> 01:15:55.992
Nibbles?

1099
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:59.750
Nibbles!

1100
01:16:02.042 --> 01:16:03.333
Dang door stuck on me.

1101
01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:05.542
Sorry.

1102
01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:08.792
Last case there was kind of a twist.

1103
01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:10.208
I know.

1104
01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:16.167
Oh my gosh. I really...

1105
01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:17.750
Oh. my heart is pounding.

1106
01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:19.792
Oh. I thought you knew.

1107
01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.167
I thought you knew.

1108
01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:23.875
Sorry. partner.

1109
01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:27.542
Hate to leave you out in the cold.

1110
01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.875
But. I'm gonna...

1111
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.208
Please don't be mad at me.

1112
01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.200
But. I mean. you get it.

1113
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.920
We've always been on the same page.

1114
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.520
Me and you.

1115
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.400
Underdogs. right?

1116
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.917
You gotta prove you're
as good as everyone else.

1117
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.333
That you belong.

1118
01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.917
I know it's messed up.

1119
01:16:51.117 --> 01:16:53.417
But. this is my chance.

1120
01:16:53.917 --> 01:16:55.208
I have to take it.

1121
01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:58.083
Cause when I get to his
great-grandma's home

1122
01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:01.292
and I burn the original patent.

1123
01:17:02.167 --> 01:17:04.500
I'll finally be something in my family.

1124
01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:07.625
And I'll finally belong. too.

1125
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:08.833
Judy!

1126
01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.375
No loose ends.

1127
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:23.083
Bye. partner.

1128
01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:27.917
Bye. Judy Hopps.

1129
01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:34.167
Pawbert. Please.

1130
01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:38.167
You can be different than your family.

1131
01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:41.542
I don't want to be different.

1132
01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:46.875
Nick.

1133
01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:50.375
Judy?

1134
01:17:58.917 --> 01:17:59.667
Judy?

1135
01:18:00.667 --> 01:18:02.208
Nibbles. do you see her?

1136
01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:04.125
No. nothing yet.

1137
01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:07.500
Ni...

1138
01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:10.000
Ni...

1139
01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:18.250
We shall... succeed. Judy Hopps.

1140
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.083
It's okay.

1141
01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:26.283
Judy sent me.

1142
01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:28.417
She needs to find Nick.

1143
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.875
Yep. Should have seen that coming.

1144
01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:37.833
Judy?

1145
01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:40.875
Nick...

1146
01:18:42.125 --> 01:18:42.750
We...

1147
01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:45.292
shall...

1148
01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:47.750
succeed.

1149
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:51.708
Judy.

1150
01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:57.208
I can't... move.

1151
01:18:58.458 --> 01:19:03.542
And you're too cold... to... help.

1152
01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:05.042
And he's gonna...

1153
01:19:06.583 --> 01:19:08.125
Nick's gonna...

1154
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.292
Judy.

1155
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:11.250
The world...

1156
01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:12.750
was never...

1157
01:19:12.917 --> 01:19:13.917
meant...

1158
01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:14.917
to be...

1159
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.083
on one animal's... shoulders...

1160
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.583
That's why my great-grandma...

1161
01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:27.167
wanted... Zootopia...

1162
01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:29.375
to be... for...

1163
01:19:29.575 --> 01:19:30.575
everyone.

1164
01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:32.958
So. we could...

1165
01:19:33.158 --> 01:19:36.167
all... help each other.

1166
01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:40.083
I... didn't... help.

1167
01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.667
You did.

1168
01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:47.000
You chose... to help...

1169
01:19:47.375 --> 01:19:48.375
me.

1170
01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.125
And became...

1171
01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:52.583
my best...

1172
01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:56.167
warm-blooded friend.

1173
01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:03.000
Very warm.

1174
01:20:12.917 --> 01:20:15.292
Permission to hug?

1175
01:20:32.292 --> 01:20:33.625
We're gonna save you.

1176
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.792
And save your friend.

1177
01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:37.958
Judy!

1178
01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:40.792
Hey! He's gonna eat that rabbit!

1179
01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:41.542
No. I... Wait!

1180
01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:42.500
I-I'm saving her!

1181
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:44.000
I'm gonna get her the anti-pen!

1182
01:20:44.083 --> 01:20:45.000
Where is she?

1183
01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:46.667
She...

1184
01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.458
She didn't make it.

1185
01:20:49.417 --> 01:20:52.708
But with snake bites you
go fast.

1186
01:20:54.042 --> 01:20:54.792
You'll see.

1187
01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:06.542
No!

1188
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.125
She's gone. Nick!

1189
01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:15.167
Just. get it over with!

1190
01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:29.792
You're done.

1191
01:21:30.583 --> 01:21:32.375
Know when to quit!

1192
01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:34.458

1193
01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:36.750
We can save her with the anti-venom!

1194
01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:38.125
Throw me the bag!

1195
01:21:39.208 --> 01:21:39.917
Judy!

1196
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.833
Leave it!

1197
01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:00.520
You're gonna kill us both.

1198
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.040
It's not worth dying for.

1199
01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.240
Agree to disagree.

1200
01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.560
<i>Stab me straight into the heart!</i>

1201
01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:53.917
- I was trying to get to you...
- I thought that you...

1202
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.833
He told me that you...

1203
01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:56.083
- I saw you...
- That you were...

1204
01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:01.240
I'll... help your friend.

1205
01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.775
Okay. I don't care that we're different.
You know?

1206
01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:12.175
What I care about is you.

1207
01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.560
I care about you.

1208
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.080
Okay?

1209
01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.640
And I didn't say it.

1210
01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.800
I should have said it.
but I didn't because...

1211
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.307
Well. because I am an emotionally insecure

1212
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:34.083
source of your discomfort

1213
01:23:34.167 --> 01:23:36.880
who is not good at
expressing his feelings.

1214
01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.840
Probably because I've been
on my own my whole life.

1215
01:23:40.865 --> 01:23:41.920
It's not an excuse.

1216
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.735
It's just it's why
instead of telling you that you're

1217
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.400
the best thing that ever happened to me.
I make jokes about your ears.

1218
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:57.040
and I tell you that you try too hard when.
you know. the truth is I just don't want you

1219
01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.840
to get hurt. because...
Because no one else in the world

1220
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.360
matters more to me than you do.

1221
01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.095
I. I do try too hard because deep down.
I'm afraid that I am what

1222
01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:12.935
everyone thinks I am.

1223
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.775
And I suppress my discomfort because I'm
worried it makes me look weak and I want

1224
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.655
to be strong. and I think
I'm failing all the time.

1225
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.760
And I only take what you say personally
because you're the only one in my life

1226
01:24:20.785 --> 01:24:24.080
who ever believed in me.
even when I don't even believe in myself.

1227
01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.833
And I should have told you that.

1228
01:24:26.859 --> 01:24:29.208
No one else in the world matters to me

1229
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:31.020
more than you do either.

1230
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.455
I have unresolved childhood trauma that I
refuse to discuss because

1231
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.655
being vulnerable scares me.

1232
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.280
I make dangerous choices because I
have an unhealthy Bunny Hero complex.

1233
01:24:39.305 --> 01:24:42.215
And I didn't join the ZPD
because I wanted to be a cop.

1234
01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.840
I joined because I always
wanted to be part of a pack.

1235
01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.760
And the thought of losing
you scares me because...

1236
01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:50.480
Because you're my pack.

1237
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.335
I should never have left you.

1238
01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.615
And I do need a herd of therapy animals.

1239
01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.720
And I should have told you that you are
the only partner I would ever

1240
01:24:58.745 --> 01:24:59.983
want because...

1241
01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:02.083
You're my fluffle.

1242
01:25:04.167 --> 01:25:05.958
That's a bunch of rabbits.

1243
01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:11.200
Now that is what we call an overshare.

1244
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.760
I'm alive. by the way.
I made it.

1245
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.440
Oh. also. that guy's still alive.

1246
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
He's gonna get to the lost
reptile neighborhood

1247
01:25:24.083 --> 01:25:26.535
find great-grandma's patent. and destroy it.

1248
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.680
Yeah. I've got no idea what that means
or who Gary is. but let's go!

1249
01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:31.935
Hopps and Wilde?

1250
01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.120
Wilde and Hopps!

1251
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.800
And Nibbles and Gary!

1252
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200
He's Gary.

1253
01:25:38.417 --> 01:25:40.295
Thank you. For the snake.
He's cold.

1254
01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.175
- No fur on him.
- Where are you going?

1255
01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.208
Bye now.

1256
01:25:46.042 --> 01:25:46.625
You.

1257
01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:49.375
You don't belong in this family.

1258
01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.295
- You will never belong in this family.
- Wait. wait. wait.

1259
01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.480
I wasn't working with them.

1260
01:25:53.505 --> 01:25:55.000
I was helping us.

1261
01:25:57.125 --> 01:26:01.455
I know where the reptile neighborhood is
buried. where to find the real patent that

1262
01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.000
proves that the snakes invented the walls.

1263
01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.735
I'm going to destroy it for the family.

1264
01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.720
For you. daddy.

1265
01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:15.295
You want to keep your job.

1266
01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.680
You say nothing.

1267
01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.080
You.

1268
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.295
Maybe you are a Lynxley.

1269
01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.600
Take me to the patent.

1270
01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.375
Takes a threesome to be some.
but a four-way to bust your doorway!

1271
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.775
Get to the patent.

1272
01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.880
Destroy it!

1273
01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.640
Go. we got this!

1274
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.160
Hi. Whiskers.
You're done

1275
01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.760
hurting my city.

1276
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.520
Uh-oh. time to turn.

1277
01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.415
Hey. Brian Winddancer.

1278
01:26:50.958 --> 01:26:54.200
You want to be a hero
or just play one on TV?

1279
01:27:19.417 --> 01:27:21.375
I go left. and you go right?

1280
01:27:21.542 --> 01:27:22.958
Uh. yeah.

1281
01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:26.083
Or...

1282
01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:42.455
You are a horrible driver!

1283
01:27:42.667 --> 01:27:43.792
Yes. I am!

1284
01:28:05.125 --> 01:28:06.125
Zoogetherness!

1285
01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:09.208
No. never mind. Forget I said it.
Here we go.

1286
01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:14.042
Matches. matches.
matches. matches!

1287
01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:18.042
Bunnies. we're burrowers.
Rabbit kick!

1288
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:24.055
I'll destroy the patent

1289
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.360
that town and everything in it.

1290
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:32.015
And a dirt bag fox and a dumb
bunny will never stand in my way.

1291
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.015
She's not a dumb bunny.
and you're forgetting one thing.

1292
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.415
What's that?

1293
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.000
We're friends with a snake.

1294
01:28:39.042 --> 01:28:39.975
Handy. partner.

1295
01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:42.055
Heads up.

1296
01:28:45.417 --> 01:28:47.667
- Daddy!
- Daddy? He's busy!

1297
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:49.333
Brian? Go!

1298
01:28:49.833 --> 01:28:51.960
You say justice is dead.

1299
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.840
I say. neigh!

1300
01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:06.920
- It's called an arrest. sweetheart.
- And boom.

1301
01:29:13.667 --> 01:29:16.240
No one will believe you over us.

1302
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.400
We've always been better than you.
and we always will be.

1303
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.440
Nothing you do matters.

1304
01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.800
Well. it matters to him.

1305
01:29:31.625 --> 01:29:32.417
Shall we?

1306
01:30:41.083 --> 01:30:42.292
One long sock.

1307
01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:32.400
I'm gonna burn it all to the ground!

1308
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.415
I'm a real Lynxley!

1309
01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.833
That'll do. pig.
That'll do.

1310
01:32:48.833 --> 01:32:50.335
Astonishing news today.

1311
01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:55.175
After officers Judy Hopps
and Nicholas Wilde. along with a pit viper

1312
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.295
and a beaver.
foiled another major conspiracy

1313
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.095
by revealing the true inventor
of the city's weather walls was a snake.

1314
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:06.958
While the now disgraced Lynxley family
were revealed to have stolen

1315
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.735
the original plans and covered it up for decades.

1316
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.760
You have not heard the last of Milton-

1317
01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.520
Their Tundratown expansion
now officially canceled.

1318
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.855
Some are calling you the dream team.

1319
01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.680
How did you do it?

1320
01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:28.073
Well. there's a lot of
different animals out there

1321
01:33:28.333 --> 01:33:33.055
and sometimes we start to look
at all the little reasons that we're

1322
01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:37.040
not the same. and it makes us worry.

1323
01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.720
But maybe if we just talk to each other.
if we just try to understand one another.

1324
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:50.120
we would see that our differences don't
really make any difference at all.

1325
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.160
Maybe we'd even see that what makes me.
me. and you. you.

1326
01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.520
can make us even stronger.

1327
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.400
And with hard work. you're going
to get to that by year two.

1328
01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.400
Yeah.

1329
01:34:07.333 --> 01:34:08.208
Zebros.

1330
01:34:09.208 --> 01:34:10.760
Actually. my name is Gene.

1331
01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.080
My name is also Gene.

1332
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.800
Zebros!

1333
01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.680
He did it.

1334
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.400
Kids. get off the snake.

1335
01:34:48.917 --> 01:34:51.542
This is my family.

1336
01:34:52.042 --> 01:34:53.250
Permission to hug?

1337
01:34:58.458 --> 01:34:59.458
Thank you.

1338
01:35:03.917 --> 01:35:04.833
Hey. uh...

1339
01:35:05.625 --> 01:35:06.625
I got you something.

1340
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:16.500
Love you. partner.

1341
01:35:17.042 --> 01:35:20.333
But I am still me. so I'm only
saying it once a decade.

1342
01:35:21.042 --> 01:35:22.083
<i>Love you. partner.</i>

1343
01:35:22.958 --> 01:35:24.083
Well. I'm gonna need that back.

1344
01:35:24.283 --> 01:35:25.283
I'll give it back to you

1345
01:35:25.483 --> 01:35:26.917
after our next case.

1346
01:35:27.167 --> 01:35:28.583
There's gonna be another case. huh?

1347
01:35:28.783 --> 01:35:29.783
Of course.

1348
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.708
Because when you broke out of jail.
you also released

1349
01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:33.542
200 highly dangerous prisoners.

1350
01:35:33.625 --> 01:35:34.625
Worth it.

1351
01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.800
Any idea where you want to start?

1352
01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:49.120
One-way ticket to Outback Island. please.
First class.

1353
01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.840
Very nice.

1354
01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.695
And remember. if you're happy with our
service. please be sure

1355
01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.040
to leave us four thumbs up.

1356
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.000
Oh. I will.

1357
01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.720
- Hopps and Wilde.
- Wilde and…

1358
01:36:07.708 --> 01:36:08.667
