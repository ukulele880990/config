00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.583
Oh. my God.

2
00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:10.622
- Oh. my God!
- Fuck this!

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:18.552
<i>They leaned against each
other in the cold night air.</i>

4
00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:21.279
<i>In that moment.
they might as well have been</i>

5
00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:23.591
<i>the last two people on earth.</i>

6
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:27.526
<i>And they trusted each other</i>

7
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.392
<i>even more
than they trusted themselves.</i>

8
00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:35.914
What do you think so far?

9
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.471
I think it's really interesting.

10
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.130
I love that you're writing about
people in relatable situations.

11
00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.270
I think that that's really good.

12
00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.341
Just tell me.
what's wrong with it?

13
00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:51.964
It's just feeling
a little bit. like...

14
00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:56.348
I don't know. like. gratuitous.

15
00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:01.871
I don't know.
What I'm hearing is

16
00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:04.149
I should stick
with teaching community college

17
00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:05.771
and forget about
being a novelist

18
00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:07.497
because
every community college teacher

19
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.085
- wants to be a novelist.
- Baby. I never said that.

20
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.363
So. I'm just another
embarrassing cliché.

21
00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:15.125
I would never say that.
I support you unconditionally.

22
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.955
Yeah. I know.

23
00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:30.624
<i>♪ Sex and violence</i>

24
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:34.455
<i>♪ Sex and violence ♪</i>

25
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.459
<i>♪ Sex and violence ♪</i>

26
00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:41.255
Oh. my God.
I didn't realize

27
00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.740
how big this place would be.

28
00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:48.089
Moving across country
is so stressful.

29
00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:50.989
I really just wanna relax
this weekend.

30
00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:52.680
Do you remember
what you said to me

31
00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:54.993
the first night
that we slept together?

32
00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:58.410
I said. "I'm so sorry. that's
never happened to me before.

33
00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:01.241
It's just because
you are so beautiful."

34
00:04:02.587 --> 00:04:03.864
No. I mean before that.

35
00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:05.866
Do you remember
what we were talking about?

36
00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.281
Uh...

37
00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:09.110
Refresh my memory.

38
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:13.045
Um. we were talking about
cancel culture.

39
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.220
and you said that our generation

40
00:04:15.324 --> 00:04:17.533
is gonna destroy
artistic expression

41
00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:20.018
'cause we're too busy
being outraged

42
00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:22.641
by anything that doesn't fit
within our worldview.

43
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:24.816
- That was a pretty hot take.
- I know.

44
00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.266
No wonder you fell for me.

45
00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:28.820
So. why aren't you taking
any chances?

46
00:04:28.923 --> 00:04:30.408
Huh?

47
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.275
You don't have to play it safe.
You can piss people off.

48
00:04:35.378 --> 00:04:37.518
You can hurt their feelings.

49
00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:39.900
Just fuck them if they hate it.

50
00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:41.419
- Okay.
- Okay?

51
00:04:41.522 --> 00:04:44.042
- Fuck them. Fuck them.
- Fuck them. Fuck them.

52
00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:47.045
-  Do you have the code?
-  Yep. Here it is.

53
00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:49.323
Ta-da.

54
00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:52.153
Oh. my God!

55
00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:55.674
This house is insane.

56
00:04:56.503 --> 00:04:58.194
How are we even affording this?

57
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.507
I know
you said we had to cut back.

58
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.336
but we couldn't spend
every night of our trip

59
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.269
in shitty hotels.
You deserve this.

60
00:05:04.373 --> 00:05:06.582
Okay. but this has to be
our last hurrah.

61
00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:10.206
because we're
a one-income household. Ooh.

62
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.554
This weekend is our last chance
to spend time and reconnect

63
00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.143
before I'm off to the races
and you start your new job.

64
00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:20.216
Do you ever think a place
like this has hidden cameras?

65
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:23.115
When I was booking it.
I specifically checked the box

66
00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.463
for "no pervert host."

67
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.603
You're cute.

68
00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:32.124
Oh. my God.
I'm gonna go check outside.

69
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:34.817
Oh. wow. there's a boat.

70
00:06:02.948 --> 00:06:03.777
Oh.

71
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.055
Hello.

72
00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:08.298
I'm declaring this weekend
"clothing optional."

73
00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:10.473
I can see that.

74
00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:11.923
- You're naked.
- Yep.

75
00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:13.856
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

76
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.615
Right now?

77
00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.721
Yeah. We don't have to.

78
00:06:16.824 --> 00:06:19.517
Oh. hey. hey. hey. hey. No.

79
00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:24.280
I have been meaning to schedule
a meeting with him as well.

80
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.419
Okay.

81
00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:27.421
Just to discuss...

82
00:06:27.904 --> 00:06:29.009
um...

83
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.149
business.

84
00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:32.357
Okay.

85
00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:33.323
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

86
00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:34.946
So. I'm gonna just...

87
00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:36.292
Yeah.

88
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.742
Hello. sir.

89
00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:40.330
It's been so long. I missed you.

90
00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:41.953
Would you like a kiss?

91
00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:44.542
Okay.

92
00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:48.062
I have a surprise for you.

93
00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:50.099
What kind of surprise?

94
00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:02.042
I'm gonna come. Are you?

95
00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.115
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

96
00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:22.649
Oh. sorry. Sorry.

97
00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:23.684
Ooh.

98
00:07:39.217 --> 00:07:40.390
Ow.

99
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:42.669
- Fuck me.
- Wow.

100
00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:45.534
- This place is huge.
- This is insane.

101
00:07:45.637 --> 00:07:46.742
Hello.

102
00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:48.882
Um...

103
00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:49.710
Oh. fuck.

104
00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:51.091
Are you guys still cleaning?

105
00:07:51.194 --> 00:07:51.988
Shit.

106
00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:54.474
Um... Hi.

107
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.510
Hi.

108
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.721
Are we in the wrong place?

109
00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:04.276
Well. I mean. the QR code
worked on the door.

110
00:08:05.312 --> 00:08:06.934
- Check-in was noon.
- I'm sorry.

111
00:08:07.038 --> 00:08:10.420
I think there might be some
sort of misunderstanding...

112
00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.146
- Well. yeah.
- ...because we've--

113
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.287
We have the...
this house for the weekend.

114
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.392
Yeah.

115
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.876
Oh.

116
00:08:18.187 --> 00:08:22.571
Right. Well. uh. I mean.
that's not good. is it?

117
00:08:22.674 --> 00:08:27.886
'Cause we also booked
this house for the weekend.

118
00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:29.647
Don't be ridiculous.

119
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.407
- Fuck.
- Hosts shouldn't be allowed

120
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.651
to list on more than one app.
That's how this shit happens.

121
00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:37.724
Yeah. There's not another
hotel for 50 miles.

122
00:08:37.827 --> 00:08:41.072
-  What do you wanna do?
-  I love this place.

123
00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:42.591
I left a message for the host.

124
00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:44.282
Hopefully. he'll call back soon.

125
00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:45.697
Fuck.

126
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.873
Yeah. Uh...

127
00:08:49.252 --> 00:08:53.843
I mean. rock. paper. scissors
to decide who stays?

128
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.156
Yeah.

129
00:08:58.503 --> 00:08:59.469
Oh.

130
00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:01.161
Okay. yeah. let's do it.

131
00:09:01.264 --> 00:09:02.024
Two out of three?

132
00:09:02.127 --> 00:09:03.094
Sure. yeah.

133
00:09:03.197 --> 00:09:04.267
Okay.

134
00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:05.683
Okay.

135
00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:09.376
Can we find a slightly
more mature solution?

136
00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:11.378
- Sure. yeah.
- Look.

137
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:13.380
We both have codes
to the front door.

138
00:09:13.483 --> 00:09:14.830
- Mm-hm.
- We both have reservations.

139
00:09:14.933 --> 00:09:17.280
We'll obviously get a refund
for this fuckup.

140
00:09:17.384 --> 00:09:18.937
There are plenty
of bedrooms here.

141
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:22.562
What. you're suggesting we share
this place with total strangers?

142
00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:25.737
I mean. we can drive to a hotel.
but it won't be this beautiful.

143
00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:28.568
And we'll still be
around strangers.

144
00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:31.363
Yeah. that's a reasonable point.

145
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:34.263
First step
to not being strangers.

146
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.230
- This is Will. I'm Cin.
- Hi.

147
00:09:36.334 --> 00:09:37.542
- "Sin"?
- With a C.

148
00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:38.647
Not short for "Cindy."

149
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.580
Short for "Cinnamon."

150
00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:42.789
Um. I'm... I'm Sage.

151
00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:44.860
- and this is Diego.
-  Hi.

152
00:09:44.963 --> 00:09:48.691
Look. I'm pretty good
at reading people.

153
00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:52.350
and I get the gist that you guys
are not the most spontaneous.

154
00:09:53.351 --> 00:09:55.180
Um...

155
00:09:55.664 --> 00:09:58.356
Guys. this is
so awkward. I get it.

156
00:09:58.459 --> 00:09:59.875
but the alternatives
are not great.

157
00:09:59.978 --> 00:10:02.532
We have food.
We have a shit-ton of alcohol.

158
00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.500
- You're an amazing chef.
- Yes. I am.

159
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.814
He'll cook you a lunch you won't
forget. And we can just agree

160
00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:10.333
that if. at any point. any of us
feel uncomfortable or weird.

161
00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:13.578
you guys can do your little
rock. paper. scissors game.

162
00:10:13.682 --> 00:10:15.304
Winner stays. loser goes.

163
00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:39.535
<i>When Will
saw this house on the app.</i>

164
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.123
<i>he thought "Bone Lake"
was a euphemism.</i>

165
00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:43.228
-  <i>Oh. great.</i>
-  <i>I thought it was called</i>

166
00:10:43.332 --> 00:10:45.092
<i>Bone Lake because it's a
secluded place where people--</i>

167
00:10:45.196 --> 00:10:47.577
-  <i>Don't say it.</i>
- Yeah. I thought that.

168
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.579
- Great minds.
- Male minds.

169
00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.341
But it turns out.
in the 1950s

170
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.791
there was this wealthy family

171
00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:55.793
that bought up
all the land in the area.

172
00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:57.173
When they discovered the lake.

173
00:10:57.277 --> 00:11:00.867
<i>they found dozens
of human skeletons</i>

174
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.696
<i>all over the beach.</i>

175
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.422
<i>One theory is</i>

176
00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:06.148
<i>there was a serial killer</i>

177
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:08.806
<i>who would dispose his bodies
in the lake.</i>

178
00:11:08.909 --> 00:11:13.465
<i>And after a storm.
they all washed ashore.</i>

179
00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:23.027
So. what brings you here?

180
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.409
Oh. you know.
just looking to spice things up.

181
00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:28.377
I'm not sure
how quick I can jump into

182
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.344
the straight-up guy talk.

183
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.279
Sage is cute as fuck.

184
00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:38.042
She's girl-next-door hot.
which is the best kind.

185
00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:41.355
Totally intended
as a compliment.

186
00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:42.943
I mean. I know how lucky I am.

187
00:11:43.047 --> 00:11:48.017
but frankly. Cin is too pretty.

188
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.919
Let's face it. Everyone
wants to fuck my girlfriend.

189
00:11:53.022 --> 00:11:54.886
I'm not saying
you wanna fuck her.

190
00:11:55.266 --> 00:11:58.269
Sage and I
are very happy together.

191
00:11:58.372 --> 00:12:02.514
Dude. I can already tell
you're a good guy.

192
00:12:04.171 --> 00:12:06.035
I like you.

193
00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:17.702
Aw. look at you both.
You're so cute.

194
00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:19.428
So. I wanna get
to know you more.

195
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.085
How'd you and Diego meet?

196
00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:23.673
Oh. we met in college.

197
00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.020
He's from Mexico City.

198
00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:26.918
but he came to the U.S.
for school.

199
00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:29.714
- So. Diego is a writer?
- Yeah. he is.

200
00:12:29.818 --> 00:12:31.923
Yeah.
Well. for the last few years.

201
00:12:32.027 --> 00:12:36.445
he's been. um. teaching
at. uh. this community college.

202
00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:39.620
But he's gonna be writing
a novel full-time now.

203
00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:41.933
- Stop. You're kidding.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:43.590
So. I'm gonna
cover us financially.

205
00:12:43.693 --> 00:12:46.317
That is a really
bold move. Sage.

206
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.009
Yeah. it's exciting.

207
00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:54.359
I think it's really sweet of you
to support his dreams like that.

208
00:12:54.463 --> 00:12:56.396
I mean. he must be
a really great writer.

209
00:12:57.224 --> 00:12:58.260
Yeah.

210
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:17.762
Hey. buddy.

211
00:13:17.866 --> 00:13:20.282
Hey. Oof. Shit.

212
00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:22.456
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

213
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.977
It's okay. You're lucky that
I have no survival instincts.

214
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:28.359
or. you know. I might
have punched you in the throat.

215
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:32.846
You're funny. man.

216
00:13:33.398 --> 00:13:35.607
Well. I'm gonna go for a run.
Wanna join me?

217
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.678
- Just gonna do 5-10 miles.
- Okay.

218
00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:40.026
Well. yeah. that sounds awful.

219
00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:42.442
- All right. man. Suit yourself.
- Yeah. enjoy.

220
00:13:48.758 --> 00:13:49.932
-  Hey.
- Oh. man.

221
00:13:50.036 --> 00:13:51.658
You gotta stop doing that.

222
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:52.970
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

223
00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:54.557
- Okay.
- Look. I. uh...

224
00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:57.284
I know you probably didn't
want me to see the ring box.

225
00:13:57.388 --> 00:13:59.597
but I did.

226
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.323
Are you thinking of...?

227
00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:05.120
Yeah. I was planning
to do it here by the lake.

228
00:14:05.223 --> 00:14:06.397
Oh. shit.

229
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.019
Until we showed up

230
00:14:08.123 --> 00:14:10.470
and ruined
your romantic weekend.

231
00:14:10.573 --> 00:14:13.266
- It's not your fault. It's okay.
- Dude. I'm so sorry.

232
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:16.441
Look. uh. you just
give me a heads-up.

233
00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:18.823
and I'll make sure
we get out of your way. okay?

234
00:14:18.927 --> 00:14:20.100
Cool. yeah. Thanks.

235
00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:21.550
The day after tomorrow.

236
00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.310
at. like. sunset?

237
00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:24.691
- Wow.
- Yeah.

238
00:14:24.794 --> 00:14:27.038
All right. great. Yeah.

239
00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:29.592
C... Can I see it?

240
00:14:30.455 --> 00:14:31.871
Sure. Yeah.

241
00:14:34.632 --> 00:14:37.807
Oh. man. It's beautiful.

242
00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.775
It was my grandmother's.

243
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.432
It's not exactly
what Sage would have chosen.

244
00:14:41.535 --> 00:14:43.537
but. you know.
it's a family heirloom.

245
00:14:43.641 --> 00:14:45.436
I'm sure she's gonna love it.

246
00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:50.234
I don't really know
what I'm doing. man.

247
00:14:50.337 --> 00:14:55.653
Look. I barely know her. but I'm
sure she wants to marry you.

248
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.932
Right?

249
00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:01.279
Well. I hope so.

250
00:15:01.383 --> 00:15:03.212
Right. All right. I'm gonna run.

251
00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:05.490
All right. cool. cool.
Yeah. yeah. enjoy.

252
00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:17.019
<i>How long have you
and Diego been together?</i>

253
00:15:17.123 --> 00:15:18.089
<i>Like. three years.</i>

254
00:15:18.331 --> 00:15:20.195
How long have you guys
been together?

255
00:15:20.298 --> 00:15:22.783
I feel like we've known
each other our whole lives.

256
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.200
We've officially been a couple
for eight years.

257
00:15:25.303 --> 00:15:27.029
but we've known each other
since we were kids.

258
00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:30.343
- Aw. that's so cute.
-  Yeah.

259
00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:34.554
It's really romantic.
but it's not without its drama.

260
00:15:34.657 --> 00:15:36.936
-  Mm.
- Our parents were really close.

261
00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:39.352
so it was a shock to everyone
we hooked up.

262
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.355
Well. hopefully. they're happy
now that you guys are so happy.

263
00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:45.185
Yeah. My dad
never really took to Will.

264
00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:47.947
I wish I was attracted
to harmless.

265
00:15:49.569 --> 00:15:50.673
I'm not.

266
00:15:55.678 --> 00:15:58.854
- Cin. what do you do?
- I'm in wealth management.

267
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.407
So. I manage
rich people's money.

268
00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:04.998
Investments and that kind
of thing. It's lucrative.

269
00:16:05.102 --> 00:16:06.413
Fun.

270
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:12.109
Diego. I have a client
I think could help you.

271
00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:15.043
Edmund Kerns.

272
00:16:15.457 --> 00:16:18.115
- It's my favorite author.
- Get out of here.

273
00:16:18.218 --> 00:16:20.117
I should get him
to read some of your work.

274
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.670
Oh. my God. No. I couldn't
ask you to do that.

275
00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.224
- No. no. no. he could. He can.
- Yes. definitely.

276
00:16:24.328 --> 00:16:27.296
You are not asking.
I'm offering.

277
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.057
But here's the thing.
I hate fiction.

278
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.611
Will loves fiction.

279
00:16:31.714 --> 00:16:33.440
Yeah. I do.

280
00:16:33.544 --> 00:16:35.097
Give him something
of yours to read.

281
00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:37.099
and if he likes it.

282
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.653
- I'll share it with Edmund.
- Thank you.

283
00:16:39.757 --> 00:16:40.965
- Wow.
-  Aw.

284
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:43.140
I'd like to make a toast.

285
00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:45.107
- Ooh.
- Okay.

286
00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:49.077
To friendship. New friendship.

287
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.458
And to Diego and Sage.

288
00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:54.772
To Will and Cin
and new friendship. Yes.

289
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:56.153
- Cheers.
-  Cheers.

290
00:16:57.499 --> 00:16:59.708
- I love you.
- I love you.

291
00:17:36.227 --> 00:17:39.403
Babe. forgot to plug in the car.

292
00:17:43.648 --> 00:17:44.753
Sage?

293
00:18:08.915 --> 00:18:10.089
Hey. Sage?

294
00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:12.021
Yeah?

295
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:13.816
Um...

296
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.680
We forgot to plug in the car.

297
00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.304
- Huh?
- The car.

298
00:18:18.407 --> 00:18:19.788
We forgot to plug it in.

299
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.962
I'm gonna go do that.

300
00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:25.483
Unless you want me
to join you in there.

301
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:28.900
Um...

302
00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:30.592
I could wash your back.

303
00:18:31.593 --> 00:18:32.904
Or your front.

304
00:18:34.216 --> 00:18:35.631
I'm okay.

305
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.496
Yeah.

306
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.395
Cool. Um. yeah. I'll just...

307
00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:42.604
I'll just go plug in the car.

308
00:18:42.707 --> 00:18:44.330
Okay.

309
00:18:55.858 --> 00:18:56.963
Diego?

310
00:18:57.066 --> 00:18:57.929
Hi.

311
00:18:58.033 --> 00:18:59.828
- Hi.
- Are you alone?

312
00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.417
Um. yeah. Sage is working

313
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.316
- and Will is out jogging.
- Oh.

314
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.457
Well. do you mind helping me
with something really quick?

315
00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:11.529
What... Um. what do you need?

316
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.945
I really appreciate it.

317
00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:16.189
- Thank you.
- Yes. of course.

318
00:19:20.814 --> 00:19:22.920
Um...

319
00:19:23.403 --> 00:19:26.889
Any idea where I should start?

320
00:19:26.993 --> 00:19:29.064
You know. I thought
they were in my makeup bag.

321
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.653
Do you mind
just looking in the bathroom?

322
00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:33.379
Bathroom. Of course.

323
00:19:38.315 --> 00:19:40.938
Probably on the counter.
The makeup bag.

324
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:43.561
Okay. yes. makeup bag.

325
00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:45.080
I shouldn't take off my contacts

326
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.771
without knowing
where my glasses are.

327
00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:49.084
Don't worry.
You know. Sage does it all the--

328
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.431
- Sorry. Sorry.
-  It's okay.

329
00:19:51.535 --> 00:19:54.020
Do you guys
both have bad eyesight?

330
00:19:54.296 --> 00:19:55.987
- Yeah.
- You wear glasses.

331
00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:58.266
- Are they there?
- Um...

332
00:19:58.369 --> 00:20:00.302
No. they... They're not here.

333
00:20:01.648 --> 00:20:02.718
Okay. Um...

334
00:20:02.822 --> 00:20:05.307
Do you mind just
finding something for me to wear

335
00:20:05.411 --> 00:20:06.653
so I'm not standing here
in a towel?

336
00:20:06.757 --> 00:20:08.241
Of course.

337
00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:09.760
My suitcase is the pink one.

338
00:20:09.863 --> 00:20:12.590
The pink one. Yeah. sure.

339
00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:13.902
Uh...

340
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.147
Okay.

341
00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:19.701
What can I get you--

342
00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:23.774
Uh. what... What do you need?

343
00:20:23.877 --> 00:20:26.294
Can you grab me
a pair of panties?

344
00:20:26.397 --> 00:20:28.296
Panties. yes. Uh...

345
00:20:28.882 --> 00:20:30.056
Oh. Okay.

346
00:20:30.436 --> 00:20:32.748
- Um...
- And a pair of jeans.

347
00:20:32.852 --> 00:20:35.164
Jeans. Okay. jeans.

348
00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:37.305
Oh. jeans. This.

349
00:20:37.408 --> 00:20:39.203
And then a cherry top.

350
00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:42.379
Cherry. Cherry. like...

351
00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:45.174
- Cherry.
- It... It has cherries on it.

352
00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:46.383
It has cherries on it.

353
00:20:46.486 --> 00:20:48.626
Oh. it does have cherries on it.

354
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.870
I... I see. Yes.

355
00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:52.527
- Okay?
- Thank you. Diego.

356
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.322
Sure. Sure. Of co--
Oh. do you want a bra?

357
00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:55.702
- I...
- No.

358
00:20:55.806 --> 00:20:56.738
- No?
- I'm okay.

359
00:20:56.841 --> 00:20:59.706
You are a lifesaver.

360
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.398
They have to be
in here somewhere.

361
00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:02.985
if you don't mind looking
a little bit more.

362
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:05.678
Uh. no. I don't...

363
00:21:05.781 --> 00:21:07.369
I... I don't mind.

364
00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:11.511
You know what? They're
probably in my car. I'll just--

365
00:21:11.822 --> 00:21:14.687
I'll put in my contacts.
and I'll look for them later.

366
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.067
Thank you. Diego.

367
00:21:16.965 --> 00:21:18.346
Diego?

368
00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:20.969
Diego?

369
00:21:21.728 --> 00:21:23.247
<i>There is a kind of loneliness</i>

370
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:25.042
<i>that lodges itself
in the psyche</i>

371
00:21:25.145 --> 00:21:28.908
<i>and never fully leaves.
Most anguishing not in solitude</i>

372
00:21:29.011 --> 00:21:31.669
<i>but in companionship
and amid the crowd.</i>

373
00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:34.534
<i>Therefore. I would ask you
to write all kinds of books.</i>

374
00:21:34.638 --> 00:21:36.364
<i>hesitating at no subject</i>

375
00:21:36.467 --> 00:21:39.159
<i>however trivial
or however vast.</i>

376
00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:41.679
<i>I hope that you will possess
yourselves of money.</i>

377
00:21:41.783 --> 00:21:43.681
<i>enough to travel and to idle.</i>

378
00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:47.133
<i>to contemplate the future
or the past of the world.</i>

379
00:21:47.236 --> 00:21:48.272
Guess we're both blind.

380
00:21:48.376 --> 00:21:50.239
Sorry?

381
00:21:50.343 --> 00:21:52.483
- Here you go.
- Oh. wow.

382
00:21:52.587 --> 00:21:55.452
I can't see anything
without my contacts.

383
00:21:55.555 --> 00:21:56.832
Luckily. I just found them.

384
00:21:56.936 --> 00:21:59.318
Yeah. my eyes are horrible.
Is this for me?

385
00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:01.975
- It is for you.
- Thank you.

386
00:22:03.736 --> 00:22:05.116
Mm.

387
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.428
Where's Diego?

388
00:22:06.532 --> 00:22:08.879
Oh. The last time I saw him.

389
00:22:08.982 --> 00:22:11.019
he was trying to find
a writing sample

390
00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:13.055
- to show Will.
- Oh. no.

391
00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:15.437
So. he'll probably be doing that

392
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:17.301
- for the rest of the weekend.
- I'm so sorry.

393
00:22:17.405 --> 00:22:19.061
I wanna make sure that you know

394
00:22:19.165 --> 00:22:21.581
I'm having so much fun
hanging out with you.

395
00:22:21.685 --> 00:22:23.549
- So have I.
- I just...

396
00:22:23.652 --> 00:22:26.034
I need to make sure
that we're cool.

397
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.589
- Yeah.
- We're cool?

398
00:22:30.038 --> 00:22:33.559
- Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?
- I don't know.

399
00:22:33.662 --> 00:22:35.837
The whole Diego seeing me
in nothing but a towel.

400
00:22:37.114 --> 00:22:40.566
I just didn't want you
to be mad at me.

401
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:43.431
So. Diego saw you in a towel?

402
00:22:43.534 --> 00:22:45.847
Well. he might have seen
a little bit more than that.

403
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.917
but it was my fault.

404
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.714
- Did he not tell you this?
- Um... No.

405
00:22:50.817 --> 00:22:52.612
I couldn't find my glasses.
I asked for his help.

406
00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:56.202
I don't want you to think that
anything inappropriate happened.

407
00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:58.515
- Yeah.
- Nothing happened.

408
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.381
I know. It's okay.

409
00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:04.797
I just know
it can get really tricky

410
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.800
this many years
into a relationship. so...

411
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:10.734
I would wanna know. you know?

412
00:23:11.459 --> 00:23:13.944
- What do you mean?
- Hm.

413
00:23:14.047 --> 00:23:15.532
Men are stupid.

414
00:23:15.877 --> 00:23:17.396
Men are really fucking stupid.

415
00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:18.604
- Yeah.
- And they do dumb shit.

416
00:23:18.707 --> 00:23:20.088
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

417
00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:21.986
And women
always blame each other.

418
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.954
Like. a guy
can stand up for himself.

419
00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:25.921
I want you to know.
and I need you to know

420
00:23:26.025 --> 00:23:27.923
that I would never let anything
inappropriate happen.

421
00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:29.166
I promise you.

422
00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:31.375
- I trust Diego. It's really--
- Good.

423
00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:33.584
Good. You should trust Diego.

424
00:23:33.688 --> 00:23:36.138
I feel so dumb
that I even said anything.

425
00:23:36.242 --> 00:23:38.969
I'm gonna go before
I say anything else stupid.

426
00:23:39.072 --> 00:23:41.281
but let me know
if you need a refill on that.

427
00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:42.973
- Okay. thank you.
- I'll see you later.

428
00:23:43.076 --> 00:23:44.008
Yeah.

429
00:23:53.293 --> 00:23:54.743
Hey.

430
00:23:54.847 --> 00:23:56.089
Hey.

431
00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:00.680
She's pretty.

432
00:24:01.301 --> 00:24:02.648
So is he.

433
00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:04.339
Yeah.

434
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.961
So are you.

435
00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:10.172
- That was really good. So good.
- That was good. right?

436
00:24:10.276 --> 00:24:13.175
Yeah. it was definitely
the right thing to say.

437
00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:18.802
They've got kind of. like.
a weird vibe.

438
00:24:21.011 --> 00:24:22.530
Sometimes.

439
00:24:23.772 --> 00:24:27.086
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

440
00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:31.470
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

441
00:24:32.505 --> 00:24:34.024
Wait.

442
00:24:34.403 --> 00:24:36.371
Do you think we should leave?

443
00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:38.131
I don't know.

444
00:24:38.718 --> 00:24:40.755
I mean. this weekend
was supposed to be just us.

445
00:24:40.858 --> 00:24:44.344
and now
we're with two strangers.

446
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:47.900
Well. we had some time
for us on this trip already.

447
00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:53.112
They ruined my clothing-optional
weekend. for sure. but...

448
00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:56.391
It's just...

449
00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:59.636
It's crazy that they offered
to get my writing read.

450
00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:03.225
I know. It's a really
good opportunity.

451
00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:04.882
- Right?
- Yeah.

452
00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:08.368
Look. if anything
too weird happens.

453
00:25:08.472 --> 00:25:10.612
we just pack our bags and go.
Okay?

454
00:25:10.716 --> 00:25:12.165
It's just tonight
and tomorrow night.

455
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:14.064
And then we're back on the road.

456
00:25:16.066 --> 00:25:17.446
Please?

457
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.208
Please? I... I really need this.

458
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.074
- Okay.
- Okay.

459
00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:35.637
-  Hey. guys.
-  Hey!

460
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:39.434
Do you guys
like to play games?

461
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.298
I like games.

462
00:25:41.643 --> 00:25:44.853
-  Diego?
- Oh. he doesn't play anything

463
00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:47.028
that has more rules
than rock. paper. scissors.

464
00:25:47.131 --> 00:25:48.926
Okay. rock. paper. scissors
is not a game.

465
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.652
it's a conflict resolution tool.

466
00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.586
- Well. we love games.
- All kinds of games.

467
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.244
Easy games. Hard games.
Low stakes. High stakes.

468
00:25:56.347 --> 00:25:59.419
Well. I'm down. but you're gonna
have to convince Diego.

469
00:25:59.523 --> 00:26:01.007
It's not--
I just don't like games.

470
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:02.733
I think there's enough
competition in the world.

471
00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:04.114
- Here we go.
- I prefer activities

472
00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:06.081
that promote harmony.
like drinks.

473
00:26:06.185 --> 00:26:07.496
- Boo!
- Thank you.

474
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.601
He also doesn't like them.

475
00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:10.016
but I'm very good at them.

476
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.535
- That is not true.
- That checks out.

477
00:26:11.639 --> 00:26:12.812
We will be so gentle with you.

478
00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:15.643
Baby. we won't be. We can't.

479
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:18.266
We can't leave you out. Diego.

480
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.613
You know what? I've got an idea.

481
00:26:20.717 --> 00:26:22.442
Oh. God. What is it?

482
00:26:22.546 --> 00:26:25.204
Why don't we break into
the locked doors

483
00:26:25.307 --> 00:26:27.724
- at the end of the hallway?
- Baby. no. that's not a game.

484
00:26:27.827 --> 00:26:29.622
- That's literally a crime.
- It's a game.

485
00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:32.832
All you need for a game
is rules and opponents.

486
00:26:32.936 --> 00:26:35.179
Our opponents
are the motherfuckers

487
00:26:35.283 --> 00:26:37.768
who booked us in this
sweet-ass lake house.

488
00:26:37.872 --> 00:26:39.908
And the rules are...

489
00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:42.601
Break into the rooms
without anyone ever knowing.

490
00:26:42.704 --> 00:26:44.016
- I don't hate it.
- You know what?

491
00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:45.811
- What?
- It's easy enough to win

492
00:26:45.914 --> 00:26:47.260
if we all play
by the same rules.

493
00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:48.986
Okay. come on.

494
00:26:51.471 --> 00:26:54.785
And first of all. why do
you have a meat tenderizer?

495
00:26:54.889 --> 00:26:57.788
Because. Diego.
I couldn't find a hammer.

496
00:26:57.892 --> 00:27:00.377
I thought you couldn't enter
without anybody finding out.

497
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.758
Uh. yeah. I can.

498
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:03.967
Which door should we do first?

499
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.278
Mmm...

500
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.556
- This one?
- This one.

501
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.282
All right.

502
00:27:09.731 --> 00:27:11.353
What? That's never gonna work.

503
00:27:11.457 --> 00:27:15.599
Oh. it absolutely works. Diego.
Check YouTube.

504
00:27:15.703 --> 00:27:17.946
You really
can learn anything online.

505
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:23.331
You just gently tap
on the side of the lock.

506
00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:28.370
and the tumblers
fall into place.

507
00:27:29.889 --> 00:27:32.892
- Guys.
- Baby. wait until you see this.

508
00:27:32.996 --> 00:27:35.067
-  What is it?
- Oh. my God.

509
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.483
I don't know what I was
expecting. but it wasn't this.

510
00:27:37.586 --> 00:27:38.795
Guys. what is this?

511
00:27:38.898 --> 00:27:40.417
Yo. we call dibs
on the sex swing.

512
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.936
Let them use it.
We have one.

513
00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:44.041
No. we're good.
Don't sit on that.

514
00:27:44.145 --> 00:27:45.974
- Yeah. Thank you.
- That's not clean.

515
00:27:46.078 --> 00:27:49.564
I don't think it's a good idea
to touch anything in here.

516
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:51.290
Do you guys want
a sex toy for later?

517
00:27:51.393 --> 00:27:53.948
No. we're good. Actually.
we're done. Let's go. Sage.

518
00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:55.501
- You wanna go?
- Yeah. let's go.

519
00:27:55.604 --> 00:27:56.882
- Fuck. yeah!
-  Thank you. guys.

520
00:27:56.985 --> 00:27:58.538
Babe. they're clean.

521
00:27:58.642 --> 00:28:01.196
Don't touch anything.
Jesus.

522
00:28:06.546 --> 00:28:08.376
-  Wait till you see this.
-  Oh. my...

523
00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:09.929
What is it?

524
00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:13.243
Guys.

525
00:28:14.002 --> 00:28:15.832
No.

526
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.113
Do Ouija boards count
as games. Diego?

527
00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:23.046
-  Fuck this.
-  Guys. I don't...

528
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:25.807
I don't...
I don't wanna be in here.

529
00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:27.015
Don't go near that thing.

530
00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:29.397
I'm regretting
coming in here.

531
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.743
and I wanna leave.

532
00:28:32.607 --> 00:28:35.196
-  What does it say?
-  "The search continues

533
00:28:35.299 --> 00:28:38.061
for prominent Manhattan
businessman Robert Price

534
00:28:38.164 --> 00:28:39.959
and his wife. Marilyn Price.

535
00:28:40.063 --> 00:28:42.928
who have been missing
for almost two weeks.

536
00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:44.757
The couple and their children

537
00:28:44.861 --> 00:28:47.070
who frequently vacation
on Bone Lake...

538
00:28:47.173 --> 00:28:49.969
- What?
- ...were scheduled

539
00:28:50.073 --> 00:28:51.281
to spend the long weekend

540
00:28:51.384 --> 00:28:53.421
at their secluded
lakefront property."

541
00:28:53.524 --> 00:28:54.560
Wait. like. this house?

542
00:28:54.663 --> 00:28:55.837
- They mean this house?
- What?

543
00:28:55.941 --> 00:28:58.391
Yeah. I think so.

544
00:28:58.495 --> 00:29:00.739
- Stop laughing. It's--
- How old is the article?

545
00:29:00.842 --> 00:29:02.775
- Look how scared you are.
- It's from...

546
00:29:02.879 --> 00:29:05.191
-  15 years ago.
-  Guys.

547
00:29:05.295 --> 00:29:07.676
- Baby. please. I can't do this.
- Yeah.

548
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.264
Yeah. I'm done. too.

549
00:29:09.368 --> 00:29:10.507
Aw. guys!

550
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.960
- Ooh. so scary.
- Yeah. That was so scary.

551
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.583
You guys don't want
door number three?

552
00:29:17.686 --> 00:29:19.758
I vote for locking these doors

553
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:21.173
and pretending we never went in.

554
00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:25.177
I had a feeling.
All right. Fair enough.

555
00:29:51.168 --> 00:29:53.481
- Are you hearing this?
- Oh. my God.

556
00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:55.000
They're pretty loud.

557
00:29:55.103 --> 00:29:56.725
Should we say something?

558
00:29:56.829 --> 00:30:00.005
Oh. God. I don't wanna
hurt their feelings.

559
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.044
You know. we can. uh.
make some noise of our own.

560
00:30:05.148 --> 00:30:07.840
See... See if we can
drown them out.

561
00:30:09.117 --> 00:30:10.360
Hey.

562
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.984
Why are you so against
using sex toys?

563
00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:16.953
Are we gonna revisit this again?

564
00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:19.300
You wrote a whole article
about it.

565
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.061
I won an award for that article.

566
00:30:22.406 --> 00:30:26.100
Not that I'll be doing that
again any time soon. but...

567
00:30:26.203 --> 00:30:29.793
Sage. if you wanna be
a freelance journalist.

568
00:30:29.897 --> 00:30:31.105
then that's what you should do.

569
00:30:31.208 --> 00:30:33.348
I didn't ask you
to take the editor's job.

570
00:30:33.452 --> 00:30:36.110
- I want us to be equals.
- I'm not saying that.

571
00:30:36.213 --> 00:30:40.148
I'm happy
to do the editing job for us.

572
00:30:40.252 --> 00:30:43.013
That has nothing to do
with your attitude on sex toys.

573
00:30:43.117 --> 00:30:45.153
I just think we should be
pleasuring each other.

574
00:30:45.257 --> 00:30:47.328
That's all.
It's our job in the bedroom.

575
00:30:47.431 --> 00:30:51.297
I don't think we should be
using things to help with that.

576
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:52.989
And I'm entitled
to have that opinion.

577
00:30:53.092 --> 00:30:55.992
You're entitled
to any opinion you want.

578
00:30:56.095 --> 00:30:58.028
but it's easy for you
to say that.

579
00:30:58.132 --> 00:31:01.135
You have a completely
different anatomy than I do.

580
00:31:07.175 --> 00:31:09.039
I saw you earlier.

581
00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:13.112
What?

582
00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:17.634
Masturbating in the bath.

583
00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:21.672
Okay.

584
00:31:22.777 --> 00:31:24.468
I offered to join.

585
00:31:29.335 --> 00:31:33.581
Are you mad at me because I
wanted to give myself an orgasm?

586
00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:36.032
No. I'm not mad. It's just...

587
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:41.037
- Don't you masturbate?
- Of course I do.

588
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.453
So. it's okay for you.
but it's not okay for me?

589
00:31:43.556 --> 00:31:47.353
The point is. I don't masturbate
instead of having sex with you.

590
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:53.014
Okay. Um...

591
00:31:56.017 --> 00:31:59.331
We should go to bed. Let's just
talk about this in the morning.

592
00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:03.922
It's--

593
00:32:50.934 --> 00:32:52.971
Oh. Sorry.

594
00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:54.800
Good morning.

595
00:32:55.111 --> 00:32:57.251
I'm so sorry.

596
00:32:57.354 --> 00:32:59.839
It's okay. it's okay.
I'm not shy.

597
00:33:00.219 --> 00:33:04.568
I-- Yeah. I was not expecting
to see anyone out here.

598
00:33:04.672 --> 00:33:07.986
I mean. it's exhilarating
how vulnerable you feel

599
00:33:08.089 --> 00:33:12.231
to be out in nature.
totally exposed.

600
00:33:15.545 --> 00:33:17.236
You should try it.

601
00:33:23.173 --> 00:33:25.175
I'm gonna go inside.

602
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:28.523
Hey. we're making brunch.
You and Diego should join.

603
00:33:28.627 --> 00:33:30.870
-  This is incredible.
-  Mimosa?

604
00:33:30.974 --> 00:33:32.286
-  Yeah. Yes!
-  Yeah?

605
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:34.736
- Okay. Wow.
-  Oh. my God.

606
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.635
-  Wow.
-  Really.

607
00:33:36.738 --> 00:33:38.016
completely my pleasure.

608
00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:40.018
Yeah. you outdid yourself. baby.

609
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.159
Fuck it.

610
00:33:43.262 --> 00:33:45.954
I have something I need to say.

611
00:33:46.058 --> 00:33:47.335
Something I need to do.

612
00:33:47.439 --> 00:33:48.647
Huh?

613
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.269
Uh... And...

614
00:33:50.373 --> 00:33:53.100
Now seems like
a really good time.

615
00:33:54.963 --> 00:33:56.103
Uh...

616
00:33:56.206 --> 00:33:57.794
Actually...

617
00:33:58.588 --> 00:33:59.796
Cin?

618
00:34:02.695 --> 00:34:03.938
Oh. Will.

619
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.526
Cin.

620
00:34:08.563 --> 00:34:11.773
You are the only woman
I have ever loved.

621
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.434
It's like time didn't even exist
until we were together.

622
00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:21.852
I was gonna propose
somewhere romantic

623
00:34:21.956 --> 00:34:25.304
like down by the lake at sunset.

624
00:34:25.408 --> 00:34:28.031
but I just couldn't help myself.

625
00:34:28.445 --> 00:34:29.929
I just... I looked at you.

626
00:34:30.033 --> 00:34:31.759
and I just
have to do it right now.

627
00:34:31.862 --> 00:34:33.623
This is my grandmother's ring.

628
00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:38.145
It's beautiful.

629
00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:45.117
Will you marry me?

630
00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:46.463
Yeah!

631
00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:47.430
Yes?

632
00:34:47.533 --> 00:34:48.258
Yes!

633
00:34:48.362 --> 00:34:49.708
- Yes?
- Yes.

634
00:34:51.537 --> 00:34:52.642
You guys.

635
00:34:52.745 --> 00:34:54.126
Let me put it on.

636
00:34:54.437 --> 00:34:55.576
-  Aw!
-  Okay.

637
00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.164
I'm shaking.

638
00:34:57.474 --> 00:35:00.374
- And yes. it fits.
- I love you.

639
00:35:00.477 --> 00:35:02.203
- I love you.
- I love you.

640
00:35:04.516 --> 00:35:05.689
Oh.

641
00:35:07.864 --> 00:35:09.797
Diego. Look at it.

642
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.661
Well done. Will.

643
00:35:12.075 --> 00:35:14.802
- Should we toast. I guess?
-  Yes.

644
00:35:14.905 --> 00:35:16.976
Cheers to this awesome weekend?

645
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.772
- Yes. to us.
-  To a life together.

646
00:35:19.876 --> 00:35:20.911
To planning a wedding.

647
00:35:21.015 --> 00:35:22.948
To planning one day--

648
00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:25.088
Will. can I...
Can I talk to you?

649
00:35:25.192 --> 00:35:26.572
Can't it wait
till after the toast?

650
00:35:26.676 --> 00:35:28.988
No. it can't wait.
I wanna talk right fucking now.

651
00:35:29.092 --> 00:35:31.232
I mean. this is kind
of a bad time.

652
00:35:31.336 --> 00:35:32.613
It just definitely can't wait!

653
00:35:32.716 --> 00:35:33.752
Diego.

654
00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:34.684
What are you doing?

655
00:35:34.787 --> 00:35:37.100
Oh. no. no. no. I...

656
00:35:37.204 --> 00:35:38.377
I know what this is about.

657
00:35:39.067 --> 00:35:41.000
Give me one second. okay?

658
00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:43.451
We'll be back. Just one minute.

659
00:35:53.427 --> 00:35:56.430
- You okay. dude?
-  "Are you okay?"

660
00:35:56.533 --> 00:35:59.191
Am I okay? What the fuck
is wrong with you?

661
00:35:59.295 --> 00:36:01.331
Look. I am so sorry.

662
00:36:01.435 --> 00:36:03.402
- I fucked up. All right?
- That's an understatement.

663
00:36:03.506 --> 00:36:05.370
You stole my grandmother's ring

664
00:36:05.473 --> 00:36:08.062
and used it to propose
to your girlfriend.

665
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.236
I know.

666
00:36:09.339 --> 00:36:10.754
I just needed to say it out loud

667
00:36:10.858 --> 00:36:13.481
so I could make sure
you hear how insane it is.

668
00:36:13.585 --> 00:36:16.967
Look. look. There's no excusing
what I've done.

669
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.280
- but can I at least explain?
- No!

670
00:36:19.384 --> 00:36:20.592
I don't want an explanation.

671
00:36:20.695 --> 00:36:23.077
Just go tell her the truth
right now.

672
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:24.182
or I'm going to.

673
00:36:24.285 --> 00:36:25.252
Look. man. our relationship

674
00:36:25.355 --> 00:36:26.839
isn't as perfect as it seems.

675
00:36:26.943 --> 00:36:28.565
No shit! Is it maybe because

676
00:36:28.669 --> 00:36:30.257
you're out of your fucking mind?

677
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.982
Don't say that. Diego.

678
00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:34.261
Don't say that. That's not nice.

679
00:36:34.364 --> 00:36:35.779
Man. I'm not a bad guy. okay?

680
00:36:35.883 --> 00:36:38.886
Even if it seems like that
at the moment.

681
00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:40.888
I'm just desperate.

682
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:43.166
I'm scared of losing her.

683
00:36:43.753 --> 00:36:48.447
Man. she supports me
emotionally and financially.

684
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:53.487
I'm sorry.
but there's nothing you can say

685
00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.490
to justify what you just did.
I'm leaving.

686
00:36:56.593 --> 00:36:58.768
Man. she's cheating on me.

687
00:37:00.356 --> 00:37:01.667
Do you know
what that feels like.

688
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:04.083
to have the person you would do
anything for

689
00:37:04.187 --> 00:37:05.395
cheat on you?

690
00:37:05.844 --> 00:37:09.537
When I saw the ring.
I saw the answer.

691
00:37:09.917 --> 00:37:12.506
I needed her to see
that I believed in her.

692
00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:15.405
and I needed to see
that she believes in me.

693
00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:18.581
Look. I shouldn't
have taken it. man.

694
00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:22.032
I shouldn't have taken it.
It was a shitty thing to do.

695
00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.001
But please. please don't...

696
00:37:25.104 --> 00:37:27.210
Don't make me
tell her right now.

697
00:37:27.521 --> 00:37:30.627
I mean. this whole thing
is so fragile.

698
00:37:32.422 --> 00:37:34.493
God. you and Sage
don't know this

699
00:37:34.597 --> 00:37:37.738
because you just don't have
to deal with this kind of shit.

700
00:37:58.034 --> 00:38:01.693
When Sage and I had been
together for a few months only.

701
00:38:02.038 --> 00:38:03.971
she slept with her ex.

702
00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:09.287
It wasn't premeditated.
He just...

703
00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:13.221
came up to see her unexpectedly.
and she let it happen.

704
00:38:13.567 --> 00:38:15.534
Oh. I'm sorry. man.

705
00:38:19.607 --> 00:38:22.472
When she told me. I was crushed.

706
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.475
I thought she had ruined
the perfect thing.

707
00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:30.377
It took time...

708
00:38:31.447 --> 00:38:33.069
but we got past it.

709
00:38:34.415 --> 00:38:38.005
- Really?
- I've had a great relationship.

710
00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.353
And I didn't have to steal
anybody's ring.

711
00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:47.290
Look. I promise
I'll get her ring back

712
00:38:47.394 --> 00:38:48.878
before the weekend is through.

713
00:38:48.981 --> 00:38:51.087
I just need a little time.

714
00:38:53.676 --> 00:38:56.955
Hey. hey. hey. I fucked up.
I fucked up. I fucked up.

715
00:39:01.097 --> 00:39:02.512
Look.

716
00:39:02.616 --> 00:39:04.065
I... I'll make sure

717
00:39:04.169 --> 00:39:08.104
that Cin gets Edmund Kerns
to read your writing.

718
00:39:08.518 --> 00:39:11.210
I know that doesn't
make up for what I did.

719
00:39:11.694 --> 00:39:15.629
but I feel like we can
help each other out.

720
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.460
Thank you so much
for helping me clean up.

721
00:39:19.564 --> 00:39:21.151
Of course. You guys cooked.

722
00:39:21.255 --> 00:39:22.843
Well. it was all Will. but...

723
00:39:23.982 --> 00:39:25.086
- Hi.
- Thank you.

724
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.294
You didn't have to do that.

725
00:39:26.398 --> 00:39:27.986
Is everything okay?

726
00:39:28.435 --> 00:39:31.472
Diego knew
that I was gonna propose.

727
00:39:31.576 --> 00:39:33.785
He helped me plan
something elaborate.

728
00:39:33.888 --> 00:39:37.202
and then I just took him
by surprise. that's all.

729
00:39:37.513 --> 00:39:40.067
I told him to make sure
I didn't fuck it up.

730
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.172
and then I fucked it up.

731
00:39:42.518 --> 00:39:44.796
No. babe.
it was the perfect proposal.

732
00:39:44.899 --> 00:39:47.971
I told him that
once I set my mind on something.

733
00:39:48.075 --> 00:39:50.215
- I just gotta do it.
-  Can't be stopped.

734
00:39:50.318 --> 00:39:52.528
- Right.
- He did everything I asked.

735
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:54.944
- It's not his fault.
- Well. Sage and I were talking.

736
00:39:55.047 --> 00:39:57.291
and I think we're running low
on supplies.

737
00:39:57.567 --> 00:39:59.293
Yeah. we need to make
sure we have enough food

738
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.675
to be able to stay
the full weekend. right?

739
00:40:01.778 --> 00:40:02.814
-  Hm.
-  Yeah.

740
00:40:02.917 --> 00:40:05.506
I mean. you guys
have been so nice

741
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.439
letting us eat your food.

742
00:40:07.543 --> 00:40:10.822
and I just wanna do
something in return.

743
00:40:10.925 --> 00:40:12.858
This would be us chipping in.

744
00:40:12.962 --> 00:40:14.791
Thank you both.
That's so nice of you.

745
00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:16.483
That's. uh...
That's amazing.

746
00:40:16.586 --> 00:40:18.692
So. I'll drive her
to that little general store

747
00:40:18.795 --> 00:40:20.418
that we saw on the way up.

748
00:40:20.521 --> 00:40:23.075
Babe. yes.
that sounds very nice.

749
00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:27.217
And I could take her.
I gotta fill the car up anyway.

750
00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:28.426
Is that okay?

751
00:40:28.529 --> 00:40:30.669
- Can you do that?
- I'll come along.

752
00:40:30.773 --> 00:40:33.983
No. Stay
and keep me company.

753
00:40:34.086 --> 00:40:35.847
Yeah. I don't mind.
I'll go with them.

754
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.400
- Stay.
-  You don't have to come.

755
00:40:37.504 --> 00:40:39.782
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm fine. Stay here.

756
00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:42.923
-  All right.
- Clean up the rest?

757
00:40:43.026 --> 00:40:43.855
Yeah. sure.

758
00:40:48.825 --> 00:40:51.518
The weather says
there might be a storm coming.

759
00:40:54.003 --> 00:40:58.041
Can I ask you
a personal question?

760
00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:02.632
Do you trust Diego?

761
00:41:04.634 --> 00:41:07.085
Yeah. of course.

762
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.019
Okay.

763
00:41:10.122 --> 00:41:12.262
Why would you ask that?

764
00:41:13.505 --> 00:41:17.613
Cin told me
something happened between them.

765
00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:19.960
I don't know.
I feel like sometimes

766
00:41:20.063 --> 00:41:23.791
she's just trying to make me
jealous or something.

767
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.278
Well. what'd she say?

768
00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:33.629
She said that Diego told her

769
00:41:33.732 --> 00:41:39.186
that you had an affair
early on in your relationship.

770
00:41:39.289 --> 00:41:43.362
and that you owe him one.

771
00:41:43.673 --> 00:41:46.780
Kind of insinuating
that if she was interested.

772
00:41:46.883 --> 00:41:49.990
that she could be the one.

773
00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:13.116
What are you looking at?

774
00:42:13.669 --> 00:42:17.500
Uh. just looking
for the best writing sample

775
00:42:17.604 --> 00:42:19.226
for you to share with
Edmund Kerns.

776
00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:22.505
I hope you're not stressing
about that. Diego.

777
00:42:22.988 --> 00:42:26.267
I need Sage. I need Sage
to take a look at this. I...

778
00:42:30.513 --> 00:42:32.860
What I'm about to say
might be...

779
00:42:34.862 --> 00:42:36.968
a little hard for you to hear.

780
00:42:38.245 --> 00:42:39.315
But...

781
00:42:40.523 --> 00:42:44.492
During one of my first
conversations with Sage. I...

782
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:48.151
I mentioned that you must be
a really talented writer.

783
00:42:49.636 --> 00:42:51.741
Diego. she didn't say anything.

784
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.504
Oh.

785
00:42:56.608 --> 00:42:59.266
She wants to believe in you.

786
00:42:59.749 --> 00:43:02.787
She wishes
that she believed in you.

787
00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:06.894
But you know.

788
00:43:10.001 --> 00:43:11.658
You know that she doesn't.

789
00:43:14.074 --> 00:43:15.247
Um...

790
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:19.873
No. I... I don't know that.

791
00:43:19.976 --> 00:43:22.565
You know. um.
Sage upended her life

792
00:43:22.669 --> 00:43:24.291
to give me a chance
as a writer.

793
00:43:24.394 --> 00:43:26.120
And I'm not gonna let her down.

794
00:43:32.471 --> 00:43:33.783
Do you wanna know something

795
00:43:33.887 --> 00:43:35.716
your favorite author
said to me once?

796
00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:38.892
I'm sure you know
he's been married for 40 years.

797
00:43:39.202 --> 00:43:41.308
but I bet you didn't know that
before he starts a new book.

798
00:43:41.411 --> 00:43:42.758
he finds a new muse.

799
00:43:45.415 --> 00:43:49.488
Have you guys
discussed that kind of thing?

800
00:43:49.592 --> 00:43:52.181
God. I can't believe
he said that. Um...

801
00:43:52.284 --> 00:43:56.703
No. No. I don't...
I don't owe him one.

802
00:43:59.464 --> 00:44:00.638
Look.

803
00:44:00.983 --> 00:44:05.332
Cin has this effect on men.

804
00:44:06.747 --> 00:44:11.062
You wanna create
something extraordinary. right?

805
00:44:11.959 --> 00:44:13.271
Yeah.

806
00:44:13.754 --> 00:44:16.136
Then you need someone
who believes in you.

807
00:44:17.516 --> 00:44:19.001
Someone who sees you

808
00:44:19.104 --> 00:44:22.452
like the extraordinary human
that you are.

809
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:25.766
Sage doesn't.

810
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.532
I could be your muse.

811
00:44:34.119 --> 00:44:38.710
Why... Why...
Why are you doing this?

812
00:44:38.814 --> 00:44:42.472
Who were you thinking
about in the bath?

813
00:44:45.096 --> 00:44:46.235
What?

814
00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:48.202
Diego told me that. uh.

815
00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:50.446
he caught you

816
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:52.068
pleasuring yourself.

817
00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:58.626
I'm sorry.

818
00:45:00.525 --> 00:45:02.251
What?

819
00:45:02.354 --> 00:45:06.289
I think that he is worried
that he's not...

820
00:45:07.256 --> 00:45:08.775
satisfying you.

821
00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:11.985
And I think that he knows that

822
00:45:12.088 --> 00:45:13.883
you were thinking
about someone else

823
00:45:13.987 --> 00:45:16.817
while you were
touching yourself.

824
00:45:21.373 --> 00:45:25.377
Look. whatever Diego...

825
00:45:27.103 --> 00:45:28.518
Whatever he shared with Cin.

826
00:45:28.622 --> 00:45:29.934
and regardless of what

827
00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:33.144
he clearly shared with you. I...

828
00:45:34.973 --> 00:45:37.735
You just got engaged.
didn't you?

829
00:45:39.115 --> 00:45:41.152
Why are you coming on to me?

830
00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:44.742
Oh. I...
I wasn't coming on to you.

831
00:45:51.265 --> 00:45:55.062
Relax. You're so tense.

832
00:45:55.166 --> 00:45:57.547
There's so much time
until they get back.

833
00:46:03.864 --> 00:46:05.866
Do you wanna know
a secret. Diego?

834
00:46:06.971 --> 00:46:09.283
We all have impostor syndrome.

835
00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:13.805
I... I apologize
if I misread the situation.

836
00:46:15.427 --> 00:46:17.222
But I don't think I did.

837
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.852
What are you doing?

838
00:46:35.068 --> 00:46:39.417
Look. are... Are you afraid
of what I might do.

839
00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:43.317
or are you afraid of
what you wanna do?

840
00:46:46.251 --> 00:46:47.735
Can I make an observation?

841
00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:54.259
<i>Diego is a great guy.</i>

842
00:46:56.572 --> 00:47:00.334
I think you're lonely.

843
00:47:00.438 --> 00:47:03.544
I think you know
that I could be there for you.

844
00:47:13.313 --> 00:47:15.729
You have permission to touch me.

845
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:18.939
I think your panties
are soaking wet

846
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.770
at the fleeting thoughts
you'll allow to enter your brain

847
00:47:23.116 --> 00:47:25.601
of all the things
that we would do to each other.

848
00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:35.576
If you would just...

849
00:47:36.715 --> 00:47:38.062
let yourself.

850
00:48:22.969 --> 00:48:24.694
Oh. shit. We gotta go.

851
00:48:24.798 --> 00:48:26.386
They'll be here soon.

852
00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:08.462
Oh. shit.

853
00:49:08.566 --> 00:49:10.602
Uh. give me the keys.

854
00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:21.993
- Hey. Diego. Is Cin upstairs?
- Uh. yeah.

855
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.651
- Hey.
- What?

856
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.309
It felt like you were gone
a really long time.

857
00:49:27.654 --> 00:49:29.345
I don't feel like
we were gone for that long.

858
00:50:07.556 --> 00:50:08.660
Hey.

859
00:50:08.764 --> 00:50:10.283
Hey.

860
00:50:11.422 --> 00:50:13.148
I wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

861
00:50:13.251 --> 00:50:15.943
I get the sense
that things have been weird.

862
00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:17.635
What's going on?

863
00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:22.053
Did Diego come on to you?

864
00:50:28.094 --> 00:50:29.819
I don't think
you should ask questions

865
00:50:29.923 --> 00:50:31.752
you don't want the answer to.

866
00:50:31.856 --> 00:50:35.618
What did you and Cin do
while me and Sage were gone?

867
00:50:36.654 --> 00:50:38.587
I don't know. small talk.

868
00:50:39.622 --> 00:50:41.141
That's interesting.

869
00:50:41.935 --> 00:50:44.213
Cin hates small talk.

870
00:50:45.249 --> 00:50:47.389
So much more fun
to get personal.

871
00:50:48.907 --> 00:50:52.221
Would you want to know if Will
did something he shouldn't have?

872
00:50:54.223 --> 00:50:55.500
Would you want Diego to know

873
00:50:55.604 --> 00:50:57.709
if you did something
you shouldn't have?

874
00:50:59.263 --> 00:51:01.955
How are you gonna get
my ring back?

875
00:51:02.438 --> 00:51:05.579
I'm working on it. okay?

876
00:51:05.683 --> 00:51:06.684
I'm working on it.

877
00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:09.583
When Diego and I first met.

878
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.208
I was-- I had just broken up
with this guy.

879
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:16.142
He was my first love. Anyway.

880
00:51:16.245 --> 00:51:22.803
Sean. the guy. my ex.
came to my apartment. and...

881
00:51:24.426 --> 00:51:26.635
I should've stopped him. but...

882
00:51:26.738 --> 00:51:29.672
But you didn't. right?

883
00:51:29.776 --> 00:51:33.745
We had sex. he left.
and I never saw him again.

884
00:51:34.988 --> 00:51:36.162
You didn't do anything wrong.

885
00:51:36.265 --> 00:51:37.887
You were just playing a game

886
00:51:37.991 --> 00:51:39.268
with different rules.

887
00:51:39.372 --> 00:51:42.168
Diego. Diego. Diego.

888
00:51:44.998 --> 00:51:46.965
You wanna play chess?

889
00:51:48.381 --> 00:51:50.314
I don't play games.

890
00:51:50.417 --> 00:51:55.388
I think you should take this.

891
00:51:58.805 --> 00:52:01.014
- Molly?
- Mm-hmm.

892
00:52:01.325 --> 00:52:04.224
- That's your solution?
-  That's my solution.

893
00:52:04.983 --> 00:52:06.882
Take this.

894
00:52:06.985 --> 00:52:09.712
and for the night. we'll just
forget about what you did.

895
00:52:09.816 --> 00:52:13.820
forget about what Diego did.
and just have fun.

896
00:52:14.614 --> 00:52:18.100
- Okay.
- Okay. count of three.

897
00:52:18.204 --> 00:52:19.791
- One.
- Two.

898
00:52:19.895 --> 00:52:21.241
Three.

899
00:52:23.899 --> 00:52:24.831
<i>He's so...</i>

900
00:52:28.179 --> 00:52:29.353
...good to me.

901
00:52:29.456 --> 00:52:30.940
I want to connect to him

902
00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:32.632
the way that I used to.

903
00:52:32.735 --> 00:52:34.910
but lately.

904
00:52:35.013 --> 00:52:37.395
when we have sex. I fake it.

905
00:52:39.604 --> 00:52:40.743
What?

906
00:52:42.089 --> 00:52:43.712
You do?

907
00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:45.921
Yeah.

908
00:52:47.509 --> 00:52:49.856
Oh. Sage.

909
00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.515
This is kind of like
a game of chess.

910
00:52:53.618 --> 00:52:56.863
How am I gonna
get your ring back?

911
00:52:56.966 --> 00:52:59.797
I'm gonna outsmart my opponent.

912
00:53:06.252 --> 00:53:07.529
Do you wanna go swimming?

913
00:53:09.462 --> 00:53:11.947
- Come on. let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

914
00:53:15.675 --> 00:53:18.022
We are rolling!

915
00:53:18.125 --> 00:53:20.335
Fuck. yeah! Let's do this!

916
00:53:22.923 --> 00:53:24.028
You took Molly?

917
00:53:24.131 --> 00:53:25.754
We did!

918
00:53:26.168 --> 00:53:27.480
- Baby? Can I have some?
- Yeah?

919
00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:29.861
No. you're not invited
to partake.

920
00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:33.348
Neither of you are.
It's ladies' night.

921
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:35.626
But baby. baby. baby.
I bought it.

922
00:53:35.729 --> 00:53:36.972
- It's my Molly.
-  Sage.

923
00:53:37.075 --> 00:53:38.525
Sage.

924
00:53:38.629 --> 00:53:39.837
Can we talk?

925
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.804
Shh.

926
00:53:41.908 --> 00:53:44.048
You can't come.

927
00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:45.222
Sage. can we talk?

928
00:53:45.325 --> 00:53:47.707
- No. it's ladies' night.
- Sage.

929
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:50.744
You can't come. Okay. bye.

930
00:53:53.989 --> 00:53:57.579
Well. the next few hours
should be interesting.

931
00:54:06.967 --> 00:54:07.865
Oh. my God.

932
00:54:11.593 --> 00:54:15.631
The rain feels amazing
on my skin.

933
00:54:25.607 --> 00:54:27.194
They've been out there
for a while now.

934
00:54:27.298 --> 00:54:28.989
Please.

935
00:54:29.093 --> 00:54:32.476
would you just relax. Diego?

936
00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:36.445
Just respect ladies' night.
They're gonna be fine.

937
00:54:38.861 --> 00:54:40.207
Hey.

938
00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:42.106
Hm.

939
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:44.798
Sage. I'm so glad I met you.

940
00:54:47.801 --> 00:54:50.287
What happened
with you and Diego?

941
00:54:53.013 --> 00:54:55.050
Cin. I need to know.

942
00:54:56.051 --> 00:54:57.052
Sage.

943
00:54:58.156 --> 00:54:59.330
Hey.

944
00:55:06.751 --> 00:55:08.339
- I'm gonna go check on them.
- Hey. hey. hey.

945
00:55:08.443 --> 00:55:10.514
I don't think you should.
I don't think you should.

946
00:55:10.617 --> 00:55:11.894
I wasn't asking
for your opinion.

947
00:55:11.998 --> 00:55:14.172
No. listen to me.
listen to me. listen to me.

948
00:55:14.276 --> 00:55:17.555
You don't have
to take my advice. but...

949
00:55:17.659 --> 00:55:20.282
I really think you should give
Sage a little space right now.

950
00:55:20.386 --> 00:55:22.491
Let her enjoy the drugs.

951
00:55:22.595 --> 00:55:26.357
Cin's gonna take
really good care of her.

952
00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.360
I'm gonna go check on her.

953
00:55:35.297 --> 00:55:36.643
Sage!

954
00:55:45.997 --> 00:55:47.136
Sage!

955
00:55:49.104 --> 00:55:50.623
Sage!

956
00:56:02.151 --> 00:56:03.532
Sage?

957
00:56:08.813 --> 00:56:09.987
Diego.

958
00:56:11.989 --> 00:56:12.990
Where's Sage?

959
00:56:14.647 --> 00:56:16.062
Somewhere out here.

960
00:56:16.165 --> 00:56:18.754
What have you been doing?

961
00:56:18.858 --> 00:56:20.066
Just talking.

962
00:56:21.308 --> 00:56:22.171
Sage!

963
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.087
Huh.

964
00:57:03.834 --> 00:57:04.697
Sage.

965
00:57:08.942 --> 00:57:10.288
- Hey.
- Hey.

966
00:57:10.392 --> 00:57:12.359
I was looking for you.
I was worried.

967
00:57:12.463 --> 00:57:13.878
I was with Cin.

968
00:57:13.982 --> 00:57:15.639
We should leave as soon
as the storm passes.

969
00:57:15.742 --> 00:57:18.124
Is there something
that you need to tell me?

970
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:19.884
Like. did something happen?

971
00:57:20.298 --> 00:57:23.612
We can talk about it after
you come down from the Molly.

972
00:57:23.992 --> 00:57:27.720
- I don't know who to trust.
- Why would you say that?

973
00:57:27.823 --> 00:57:28.824
Oh. shit.

974
00:57:28.928 --> 00:57:30.688
Diego. I need
to tell you something.

975
00:57:30.792 --> 00:57:32.241
- What?
- I--

976
00:57:32.345 --> 00:57:33.415
Oh. my God!

977
00:57:33.519 --> 00:57:35.486
- It's just us.
-  Hi.

978
00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.212
We weren't sure
where you guys were.

979
00:57:37.315 --> 00:57:41.285
You left me all alone. Sage.
So. so cold out there.

980
00:57:41.388 --> 00:57:43.908
Yeah. I... I needed to get dry.

981
00:57:44.012 --> 00:57:46.566
Storm must have taken down
the power lines.

982
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:48.775
Well. we have a really nice
fireplace going.

983
00:57:48.879 --> 00:57:49.983
We should stick together.

984
00:57:50.087 --> 00:57:51.640
Uh. I'm gonna check
the breaker box.

985
00:57:51.744 --> 00:57:53.366
Maybe lightning
tripped the main breaker.

986
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.988
No. I bet it's a downed
power line.

987
00:57:55.092 --> 00:57:57.197
- I'm gonna check it anyway.
- No. no. don't worry. you guys.

988
00:57:57.301 --> 00:57:58.958
Look after the girls. okay?

989
00:57:59.061 --> 00:58:01.719
-  Okay.
- I'll check the box.

990
00:58:02.513 --> 00:58:04.895
Mm.

991
00:58:04.998 --> 00:58:06.379
Cin. could you give us a second?

992
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.554
- We need to get dressed.
-  Yeah.

993
00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:12.074
I said--
Uh. we'll be very quick. Cin.

994
00:58:12.178 --> 00:58:13.524
- so I need you--
- I don't want to be alone.

995
00:58:13.628 --> 00:58:14.905
My eyes are closed.
You can change.

996
00:58:15.008 --> 00:58:16.423
It's gonna be okay.
It's very quick.

997
00:58:16.527 --> 00:58:18.184
It's very quick. I promise.

998
00:58:22.153 --> 00:58:24.846
Why do you think
you can't trust me?

999
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:27.262
Do you trust me?

1000
00:58:30.955 --> 00:58:32.819
- What's going on?
- Shh.

1001
00:58:35.891 --> 00:58:37.479
You weren't supposed
to leave them alone.

1002
00:58:37.583 --> 00:58:39.308
I had to.

1003
00:58:39.792 --> 00:58:42.001
Would've been suspicious
if I didn't.

1004
00:58:42.104 --> 00:58:45.383
I thought
this would be over by now.

1005
00:58:46.074 --> 00:58:50.492
They've been a challenge.
It's so much more fun that way.

1006
00:58:50.596 --> 00:58:51.873
Fuck you!
I know there's something

1007
00:58:51.976 --> 00:58:53.875
going on between you and Cin!

1008
00:58:53.978 --> 00:58:58.120
- Did you fuck her or not?
- I swear to God I didn't!

1009
00:58:58.224 --> 00:58:59.605
I don't believe you. Diego!

1010
00:58:59.708 --> 00:59:02.090
I don't believe a word that
comes out of your mouth!

1011
00:59:02.193 --> 00:59:04.195
Just calm down. please.

1012
00:59:04.299 --> 00:59:06.163
- Listen to me.
- I'm not gonna listen to you.

1013
00:59:06.266 --> 00:59:09.753
I don't ever wanna see you
or speak to you again!

1014
00:59:09.856 --> 00:59:12.790
Sage. wait! Where are you going?

1015
00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:16.380
Guys. guys. I need your help.
Sage and I got in a fight.

1016
00:59:16.483 --> 00:59:18.693
It wasn't the circuit breaker.

1017
00:59:18.796 --> 00:59:20.936
-  What happened?
- You happened! Okay?

1018
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.214
She's fucking pissed.
She ran out.

1019
00:59:23.318 --> 00:59:25.838
Please go look for her. She said
she never wants to see me again.

1020
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:27.805
Of course we will.
Of course we will.

1021
00:59:27.909 --> 00:59:29.807
- We'll find her.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1022
00:59:29.911 --> 00:59:31.533
- Yeah.
- Of course.

1023
00:59:31.982 --> 00:59:35.295
-  Sage? Sage?
-  Sage! Sage!

1024
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:38.782
Okay. they're gone. Hey.

1025
00:59:41.716 --> 00:59:43.407
Something fucked up
is going on here.

1026
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:45.133
I know. Yeah. no shit.

1027
00:59:46.203 --> 00:59:48.723
I didn't really take the Molly.

1028
00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:50.448
What? Why didn't you
tell me that before?

1029
00:59:50.552 --> 00:59:54.591
'Cause I didn't know if they
were watching or listening.

1030
00:59:54.694 --> 00:59:57.317
These?
It's not a real prescription.

1031
00:59:57.421 --> 00:59:59.699
- What?
- Where are your keys?

1032
00:59:59.803 --> 01:00:01.563
- Fuck.
- Where are your keys?

1033
01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:03.565
- Uh...
- Where are your keys?

1034
01:00:03.669 --> 01:00:05.774
They're next to my phone.
Here.

1035
01:00:06.188 --> 01:00:08.950
- They were just here!
- They're not there?

1036
01:00:09.053 --> 01:00:11.711
- No.
- Do you think they took them?

1037
01:00:11.815 --> 01:00:13.575
Seems fucking possible
at this point.

1038
01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:15.059
Okay.

1039
01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:19.339
Okay. I'm gonna
ask you this once.

1040
01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:21.238
Okay.

1041
01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:24.103
Cin and Will both said to me

1042
01:00:24.482 --> 01:00:26.415
that you tried
to sleep with her.

1043
01:00:27.244 --> 01:00:28.107
And that I owe you one

1044
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.074
- because of Sean.
- They're lying.

1045
01:00:30.178 --> 01:00:31.800
- So. just tell me if it's true.
- No. no. no. no.

1046
01:00:31.904 --> 01:00:33.871
They're lying. okay?
I didn't know how to tell you

1047
01:00:33.975 --> 01:00:35.459
'cause it seems very unlikely.

1048
01:00:35.562 --> 01:00:37.185
but she tried to fuck me.

1049
01:00:37.288 --> 01:00:39.083
I swear to God.
it was so fucking weird.

1050
01:00:39.187 --> 01:00:41.189
- I didn't touch her.
- How did she know about Sean?

1051
01:00:41.292 --> 01:00:43.536
I never mentioned Sean
to her. okay?

1052
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.434
I told Will about
what happened to Sean.

1053
01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:48.645
but not that it meant that
I could sleep with someone else.

1054
01:00:49.369 --> 01:00:52.925
Did you tell Will about me
masturbating in the bath?

1055
01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:56.031
Sage. no. I promise I didn't.

1056
01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:01.312
Okay.

1057
01:01:02.486 --> 01:01:04.108
What? Sage.

1058
01:01:07.387 --> 01:01:08.734
What? What?

1059
01:01:08.837 --> 01:01:10.218
Well. if you didn't tell him.

1060
01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:12.461
there's only one way
he could know.

1061
01:01:12.565 --> 01:01:14.222
They're recording us?

1062
01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:21.919
- Come on.
- Fuck.

1063
01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:26.924
-  Room number three.
-  You sure about this?

1064
01:01:27.028 --> 01:01:29.271
We don't have another
option. They have our keys.

1065
01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:31.653
They get off
on fucking with us.

1066
01:01:31.757 --> 01:01:34.311
I think they're playing
some kind of a game.

1067
01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:36.762
Well.
if they want us to play.

1068
01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:38.487
there has to be a way to win.

1069
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.401
What the fuck is this?

1070
01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:03.512
Um...

1071
01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:13.177
Huh.

1072
01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:15.801
- Sage. Sage.
- Yeah.

1073
01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:17.664
There's a picture of us here.

1074
01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:19.459
- No. What?
- Yeah.

1075
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:29.124
- That is us.
- Are these... other couples?

1076
01:02:29.228 --> 01:02:30.747
I don't know.

1077
01:02:33.611 --> 01:02:35.821
Oh. my God.

1078
01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.207
What is this?

1079
01:02:51.526 --> 01:02:52.423
What?

1080
01:03:03.055 --> 01:03:04.953
This is their house.

1081
01:03:08.025 --> 01:03:09.302
This is their fucking house.

1082
01:03:09.406 --> 01:03:11.580
- Come here. Take a look at this.
- What?

1083
01:03:13.686 --> 01:03:14.998
You were right to be worried.

1084
01:03:15.101 --> 01:03:17.483
The cameras
were hidden behind the mirrors.

1085
01:03:30.427 --> 01:03:32.567
Shit.

1086
01:03:53.036 --> 01:03:55.866
<i>What did you and Cin do
while me and Sage were gone?</i>

1087
01:04:01.389 --> 01:04:04.910
-  <i>Hey. Sage?</i>
-  <i>Yeah?</i>

1088
01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:08.775
After we booked
our stay. they started

1089
01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:12.055
researching us. going through
our socials and everything.

1090
01:04:13.297 --> 01:04:16.956
They... They're trying to
make us not trust each other.

1091
01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.475
We have
to get the fuck out of here.

1092
01:04:18.578 --> 01:04:20.477
Delete our fucking videos
and get out of here.

1093
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.444
I'm gonna break this thing.
I don't wanna leave anything.

1094
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.552
Okay. do you know
what to break? Okay.

1095
01:04:28.002 --> 01:04:31.626
Well done. Well played.

1096
01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.283
Bravo.

1097
01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:35.423
You didn't have
to destroy the drive.

1098
01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:37.666
Everything's recorded
in the cloud.

1099
01:04:39.013 --> 01:04:40.393
What are you doing?

1100
01:04:40.497 --> 01:04:41.532
Why are you doing this?

1101
01:04:41.636 --> 01:04:42.706
What the fuck is this?

1102
01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:45.398
It's just a game. Sage.

1103
01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:51.473
Think of it as an opportunity to
prove your love to each other.

1104
01:04:53.303 --> 01:04:56.340
Don't you feel like
everywhere you go.

1105
01:04:56.444 --> 01:04:59.550
everyone you meet
is playing their own game

1106
01:04:59.654 --> 01:05:01.345
by their own rules.

1107
01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:04.659
and no one ever tells you
what their rules are?

1108
01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:08.801
What?

1109
01:05:09.388 --> 01:05:11.079
You guys asked us
to come in here last night.

1110
01:05:11.183 --> 01:05:12.909
What would you have done
if we said yes?

1111
01:05:13.012 --> 01:05:15.566
I wouldn't have let you
come in here.

1112
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:17.154
I would have stopped you.

1113
01:05:17.499 --> 01:05:20.502
Sage. almost getting caught
is part of the fun.

1114
01:05:20.606 --> 01:05:22.228
How many fucking times

1115
01:05:22.332 --> 01:05:23.920
- have you done this before?
-  Six.

1116
01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:25.369
- Six?
- Mm-hm.

1117
01:05:25.473 --> 01:05:27.406
Six including them
or not including them?

1118
01:05:27.509 --> 01:05:29.063
They asked how many times
we've done this before.

1119
01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:31.134
- Six. not including them.
- What am I missing?

1120
01:05:31.237 --> 01:05:33.619
Hello? Hello? Okay.
we're out of here. okay?

1121
01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:36.001
We don't care about
your little fucking game.

1122
01:05:36.104 --> 01:05:38.072
Give us our key back.

1123
01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:40.453
Wanna know what happens
when you lose?

1124
01:05:41.006 --> 01:05:42.352
No.

1125
01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.458
Give me my key back.

1126
01:05:45.562 --> 01:05:46.873
Diego.

1127
01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:50.636
- It's okay.
- If we give you these keys now.

1128
01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:55.192
there are things about us
and things about each other...

1129
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:58.471
that you're never gonna know.

1130
01:06:01.647 --> 01:06:05.340
- Yeah. we're good. I think.
-  I know you are.

1131
01:06:05.444 --> 01:06:09.275
Diego. don't you wanna know just
a little bit more about Sage?

1132
01:06:09.379 --> 01:06:12.037
We just really
wanna leave. okay?

1133
01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.417
Please let us leave.

1134
01:06:13.521 --> 01:06:17.111
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Fair enough.

1135
01:06:19.837 --> 01:06:21.218
-  Go ahead.
- Come on. Sage.

1136
01:06:21.322 --> 01:06:22.979
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1137
01:06:23.082 --> 01:06:24.670
- We're gonna miss you.
- Get out of the--

1138
01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.051
- Hey.
- We're gonna miss you.

1139
01:06:26.154 --> 01:06:28.777
- Drive safe.
- We're gonna miss you.

1140
01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:31.746
Hey. give me my ring back.

1141
01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:35.405
If you leave now. you leave
without the ring. buddy.

1142
01:06:36.854 --> 01:06:38.580
I'll be back for it.

1143
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.001
Fuck. it's unplugged.

1144
01:06:45.104 --> 01:06:46.174
What?

1145
01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:50.696
There's only six miles
in the battery.

1146
01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:53.043
He must have unplugged it
right after I plugged it in.

1147
01:06:53.147 --> 01:06:54.596
Okay. let's just go.

1148
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.909
We're gonna be in the middle
of nowhere in the woods.

1149
01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.462
Baby. we have to go.

1150
01:06:58.566 --> 01:07:00.430
We have to just
get the fuck out of here. okay?

1151
01:07:00.533 --> 01:07:02.777
Jesus.

1152
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.572
I fucked her. Diego.

1153
01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:06.470
I fucked her
in the back of my car.

1154
01:07:06.574 --> 01:07:09.059
That's why we were gone
so long earlier.

1155
01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:15.169
He tried. Nothing happened.

1156
01:07:15.272 --> 01:07:17.102
I bet my cum
is still inside of her. man.

1157
01:07:17.205 --> 01:07:19.173
- What?
- He's fucking lying!

1158
01:07:19.276 --> 01:07:20.519
Will you just... Just drive!

1159
01:07:20.622 --> 01:07:22.141
- He's fucking lying!
- No. there is evidence.

1160
01:07:22.797 --> 01:07:24.661
There's video. Diego.

1161
01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:26.766
- He's playing a fucking game!
-  Come back--

1162
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:28.837
We already won the game. Sage.

1163
01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:30.425
I fucked you!

1164
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:33.290
Diego resisted Cin.
but I fucked you.

1165
01:07:33.394 --> 01:07:34.878
What is this?
You take two people

1166
01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:36.190
that are very fucking in love.

1167
01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:37.950
in a committed.
happy relationship.

1168
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.952
and you just annihilate it?

1169
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.714
Happy and committed
is a stretch. Sage.

1170
01:07:43.818 --> 01:07:47.442
But. yes. we... We... We help...
We help people see the truth.

1171
01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:51.136
Diego. if you leave now...

1172
01:07:51.239 --> 01:07:52.137
- Diego?
- Shut up. shut up.

1173
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.310
- Baby--
- Shut up.

1174
01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:54.622
Shut up!

1175
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.281
Sage. why didn't you
mention this before?

1176
01:08:01.007 --> 01:08:02.768
You didn't tell me about Cin.

1177
01:08:02.871 --> 01:08:04.494
Not at first. but then I did.

1178
01:08:04.597 --> 01:08:07.669
Okay. I didn't
have sex with him.

1179
01:08:07.773 --> 01:08:09.050
I didn't tell you because--

1180
01:08:09.154 --> 01:08:11.121
Because you cheated before.

1181
01:08:13.365 --> 01:08:15.091
I didn't do this.

1182
01:08:15.194 --> 01:08:17.334
I don't think
he believes you. Sage.

1183
01:08:17.438 --> 01:08:18.646
- I didn't do this.
- Diego.

1184
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:21.166
I mean. she just
doesn't want you to see

1185
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:23.202
the things that she did.

1186
01:08:23.306 --> 01:08:25.825
- Baby. please.
- You can't trust her. okay?

1187
01:08:25.929 --> 01:08:29.519
We are not safe here. okay?
We have to go now.

1188
01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:32.556
I love you. I didn't do this.

1189
01:08:37.975 --> 01:08:38.873
I believe her.

1190
01:08:38.976 --> 01:08:40.323
Oh.

1191
01:08:40.426 --> 01:08:43.257
Sage. why don't you tell him
what you told Cin?

1192
01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.399
You know what. fuck you
and your game. You lose.

1193
01:08:49.642 --> 01:08:50.816
Just go.

1194
01:08:54.268 --> 01:08:56.304
Baby? Baby!

1195
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.309
Oh. fu... Fuck!

1196
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:41.211
- Hey. Hey!
-  Hey. hey.

1197
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.421
Relax.
You're not going anywhere.

1198
01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.391
- Come on.
- How's your leg. Diego?

1199
01:09:48.736 --> 01:09:51.256
Remember this?
It was in your car.

1200
01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.269
Why us? We haven't done
anything to you.

1201
01:10:04.372 --> 01:10:09.032
Diego. It's... It's really--
It's nothing personal.

1202
01:10:09.135 --> 01:10:12.173
But if we can destroy
in one weekend

1203
01:10:12.277 --> 01:10:15.970
what it's taken you
years to build.

1204
01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:19.387
I mean. why should you
be together?

1205
01:10:19.491 --> 01:10:22.079
Either you resist us

1206
01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:24.012
and prove
your love to each other

1207
01:10:24.116 --> 01:10:26.877
and live.

1208
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.570
or you wind up at the bottom
of the lake.

1209
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.988
No couple's played our game
and made it till the morning.

1210
01:10:34.885 --> 01:10:36.749
What makes you guys
any different?

1211
01:10:38.682 --> 01:10:41.616
We didn't... We didn't break up.

1212
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.410
Oh.

1213
01:10:42.514 --> 01:10:43.342
- Yeah.
- We won!

1214
01:10:43.446 --> 01:10:44.757
We won your fucking game!

1215
01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:46.449
We won.
so you have to let us go!

1216
01:10:46.552 --> 01:10:48.002
You have to let us go!

1217
01:10:48.105 --> 01:10:51.005
We have to let them go.

is lie to each other

1220

since you got here.

1221
01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:00.670

1226
01:11:10.404 --> 01:11:11.853
- Great place.

1227
01:11:11.957 --> 01:11:13.441
Wow.

1228
01:11:14.649 --> 01:11:17.928
You'll never show up there. obviously.

1229
01:11:24.141 --> 01:11:26.454
Why are you telling us
all of this?

1230
01:11:26.799 --> 01:11:29.526
- Tell them.
- Should I tell them?

1231
01:11:45.784 --> 01:11:47.682
Let's look back. shall we?

1232
01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:23.960
Have you figured it out?

1233
01:12:26.549 --> 01:12:30.380
My name is Thomas.
and this is Alice.

1234
01:12:32.278 --> 01:12:34.729
Our parents were
Robert and Marilyn Price.

1235
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.564
You read about them. Diego.

1236
01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:44.083
Room number two.
in the newspapers?

1237
01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:46.327
Ooh.

1238
01:12:46.914 --> 01:12:51.056
Does that... Does that make
you feel a little outraged?

1239
01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:54.577
Not fit with your worldview?

1240
01:12:58.512 --> 01:13:02.516
Since we were little. Tom
and I have had a special bond.

1241
01:13:05.277 --> 01:13:07.866
<i>We spent all our time together.</i>

1242
01:13:10.455 --> 01:13:12.698
<i>Not only were we
brother and sister.</i>

1243
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:15.460
<i>but we were best friends.</i>

1244
01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:21.569
<i>Our mom tried to keep us apart.</i>

1245
01:13:22.846 --> 01:13:26.885
We'd lie together
and fall asleep.

1246
01:13:28.645 --> 01:13:31.027
And our love...

1247
01:13:32.856 --> 01:13:34.548
evolved.

1248
01:13:39.069 --> 01:13:40.243
When we were teenagers.

1249
01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:42.590
our mother caught us
in bed together.

1250
01:13:42.694 --> 01:13:45.075
She told our dad.
and he beat us.

1251
01:13:45.179 --> 01:13:46.560
They thought we were monsters.

1252
01:13:46.663 --> 01:13:49.494
So. we did what we had to.

1253
01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:55.189
We proved our love to the world.

1254
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.443
Look.

1255
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.068
What your parents did
was horrible.

1256
01:14:13.103 --> 01:14:14.553
but we're not them.

1257
01:14:14.657 --> 01:14:16.003
But you are.

1258
01:14:16.106 --> 01:14:17.867
You're the kind of people
that should be judging

1259
01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:20.801
your own relationship.
and you're judging ours instead.

1260
01:14:20.904 --> 01:14:25.081
Cin. please.
Please. just... Just let us go.

1261
01:14:25.184 --> 01:14:28.671
We're not... We're not gonna
tell anybody about this.

responsibility fell on me

1292

And we weren't equals anymore.

1293
01:15:41.053 --> 01:15:42.503

Sage!

1395
01:24:16.948 --> 01:24:19.847
Diego!  Diego!

1396
01:24:30.789 --> 01:24:33.516
Sage! Sage!

1397
01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:36.933
Sage!

1398
01:24:37.037 --> 01:24:39.419
Sage!

1399
01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:42.801
I don't think she's coming. man.

1400
01:24:56.298 --> 01:24:59.370
Watch your step.
Watch your-- Aw.

1401
01:24:59.473 --> 01:25:01.061
No. no. no.
You don't have to do this.

1402
01:25:01.165 --> 01:25:03.546
Are you fucking kidding me?

1403
01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.307
- No!
- You know.

1404
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:08.344
you think
you're so fucking perfect.

1405
01:25:08.448 --> 01:25:12.486
but really. you're just messy.
fucked-up people just like us.

1406
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:14.247
Please. please. please.
No. no. no!

1407
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.903
Please! No. no. no!

1408
01:25:16.007 --> 01:25:17.664
- No! No!
- No. no. no!

1409
01:25:23.911 --> 01:25:25.568
Fuck.

1410
01:25:52.008 --> 01:25:53.562
Are you okay?

1411
01:25:54.804 --> 01:25:58.049
- I'm not... Not great.
- Here. babe. Here.

1412
01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:01.259
- You?
- I've been better.

1413
01:26:03.641 --> 01:26:04.676
Where is she?

1414
01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:07.231
I stabbed her in the foot.

1415
01:26:07.334 --> 01:26:08.784
She's stuck to the dock.

1416
01:26:09.681 --> 01:26:12.753
- Okay. Can you stand?
- Yeah. yeah.

1417
01:26:12.857 --> 01:26:13.789
Okay.

1418
01:26:25.939 --> 01:26:27.458
Chainsaw's dead.

1419
01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:29.114
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

1420
01:26:30.495 --> 01:26:32.187
Both cars are fucked.

1421
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.674
Let's take the boat.

1422
01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:38.641
Okay.

1423
01:26:39.263 --> 01:26:40.747
- Okay.
- Hang on.

1424
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:42.921
Okay.

1425
01:26:45.614 --> 01:26:49.411
I finally have to admit I'm...
I'm not good enough.

1426
01:26:49.514 --> 01:26:50.688
Maybe I can write on the side.

1427
01:26:50.791 --> 01:26:53.242
but I shouldn't have quit
my job.

1428
01:26:53.656 --> 01:26:57.660
I'm a good teacher. you know?
I'm a so-so writer.

1429
01:26:58.247 --> 01:27:00.974
I just want you to know that
I'm going back to teaching.

1430
01:27:01.077 --> 01:27:02.389
- Okay.
- Okay?

1431
01:27:02.493 --> 01:27:04.288
And that you're still
gonna have to read

1432
01:27:04.391 --> 01:27:05.944
my mediocre writing.

1433
01:27:06.048 --> 01:27:08.775
And maybe now I can write
about fucked-up people.

1434
01:27:08.878 --> 01:27:11.260
but our future
won't depend on it.

1435
01:27:11.743 --> 01:27:13.745
Fuck! Where did she go?

1436
01:27:16.472 --> 01:27:17.439
Got it?

1437
01:27:17.542 --> 01:27:18.923
Yeah.

1438
01:27:22.823 --> 01:27:24.031
Hang tight!

1439
01:27:24.135 --> 01:27:25.688
Oh. shit. We're tied.

1440
01:27:26.793 --> 01:27:29.382
Get the axe!
Get the fucking axe!

1441
01:28:36.794 --> 01:28:38.313
Die already!

1442
01:28:54.984 --> 01:28:56.158
Sage!

1443
01:28:56.261 --> 01:28:58.160
Reverse.

1444
01:29:01.232 --> 01:29:02.406
Sage!

1445
01:29:06.133 --> 01:29:07.825
- Sage!
- It's stuck!

1446
01:29:10.414 --> 01:29:11.691
Sage!

1447
01:29:12.554 --> 01:29:13.865
Sage!

1448
01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:19.837
Die!
