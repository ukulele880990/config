00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:25.286
Bleh.

4
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.453
Blood. blood. blood! And death.

5
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:30.647
All right. you know
what. you're milking it.

6
00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:32.668
Besides. I think we got it.
I think we got it.

7
00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:34.717
We got it up there.
Thank you. Yakety-yak!

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.737
You laid it all out beautifully.

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.280
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you. too.

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.809
It's my word against yours.

11
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.980
Actually...

12
00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:46.607
<i>And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>

13
00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:48.400
It's your word against yours.

14
00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.882
It's called a hustle. sweetheart.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.780
Boom.

16
00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:58.560
Unlikely duo. Judy Hopps.
the city's first bunny cop.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.397
and Nicholas Wilde.
a small-time street fox.

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.877
uncovered a conspiracy by Mayor Bellwether
today using a toy carrot recorder pen.

19
00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:08.420
<i>I can frame you. too.</i>

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.668
Wilde later joined the ZPD himself.
where the pair are now the very first

21
00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:20.640
bunny-fox team in the history of Zootopia.

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.128
New mayor and former actor
Brian Winddancer. hailed the two

23
00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:31.496
during celebrations for the 100th anniversary
of the invention of Zootopia's weather walls

24
00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:36.597
that allowed all environments
and all animals to coexist in one city.

25
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
This is our Zootennial.

26
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.619
And if a lowly country bunny 
and a shifty likely criminal fox

27
00:01:44.644 --> 00:01:50.637
can ignore their vast. vast differences 
and solve bias and stereotype forever.

28
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.347
then maybe we can all embrace our

29
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.040
differences and be better zoogether.

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.976
We're gonna crack a new case.
make the world a better place.

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.918
and be the greatest partners of all time!

32
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:06.398
I mean. we're not that different.

33
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:24.420
At the ZPD. partnership is
the cornerstone of success.

34
00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.586
You want to put bad guys away?

35
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.280
Be on the same page every day.

36
00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.992
Now. today's bad guy 
is this customs inspector.

37
00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:37.720
who's been smuggling illegal 
overseas cargo through the city's shipyard.

38
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.797
Captains Hoggbottom and Truffler will lead.

39
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.168
Higgins. Bloats. flank left.
Chèvre. Bücheron. right.

40
00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:48.200
- and down the middle. the Zebros.
- Zebros!

41
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.840
Hopps and Wilde.
I know you're eager to prove yourselves.

42
00:02:50.923 --> 00:02:56.480
but as rookies. you will observe only and
watch the veteran teams show you how it-

43
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.209
Chief. hi.

44
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800
If you're looking for Nick and Judy.

45
00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:05.800
They said they got it! And they're
already on site with their baby!

46
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.157
Are you sure this will work?

47
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.000
You're the one that said we needed a bust.

48
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.197
Just follow my lead. okay?
Act casual.

49
00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:21.518
- Hey!
- Here we go.

50
00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:22.200
Hello!

51
00:03:22.613 --> 00:03:25.313
This whole area is restricted.
You can't be here.

52
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.397
Whoa.
Fox and bunny.

53
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.240
- Okay..
- Yes. but proud parents first. Mr...

54
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.108
Inspector.
Inspector Snootley.

55
00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:35.782
Inspector?

56
00:03:35.827 --> 00:03:36.800
What do you do?

57
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.240
Ensure that nothing illegal gets smuggled
here in one of these cargo containers?

58
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.900
That's a weird way to ask that.

59
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.997
Anyway. you got to leave.

60
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.160
You can't be here.

61
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.960
Wait. wait.

62
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.080
He's right.
Gosh. darn it.

63
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.000
You are right. sir.

64
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.720
I guess we should have thought
this through. right. babe?

65
00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.496
Before we decided to come down here
to this beautiful industrial shipyard

66
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:06.680
to celebrate the big day 
of our birthday boy.

67
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.320
It's his birthday?

68
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.360
Yeah. first one since...

69
00:04:12.647 --> 00:04:14.047
Since the accident.

70
00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:18.550
And you know the one thing this little
stinker wished for.

71
00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.463
aside from one day 
getting his tail reattached. yeah

72
00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:24.160
was to see a choo-choo.

73
00:04:24.588 --> 00:04:28.003
And to maybe get a toot-toot
conductor to sign his cast.

74
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:33.472
But I'm betting a customs inspector
would be even better.

75
00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:34.387
Really?

76
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.417
All right.
For the kid.

77
00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:39.052
- For the kid.
- Oh. you're a saint.

78
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.436
We thank you so much.
Here you go.

79
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:43.327
Either leg. Or both!
I don't care.

80
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.028
Maybe put a doodle on it.
Doesn't need to be perfect.

81
00:04:46.106 --> 00:04:47.557
He's also legally blind.

82
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.407
I put a little train there
because I know you like trains.

83
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.360
Come on. come on. come on.

84
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.037
- Just...
- Yes. I know.

85
00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:01.005
- Hurry!
- I got this.

86
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:02.877
Jiggle it. jiggle it.
jiggle it. jiggle it.

87
00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:04.597
Hopps and Wilde!

88
00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:06.106
You are not authorized!

89
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:08.305
Stand down and wait for backup.

90
00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.833
- Toot-toot.
- It's the fuzz!

91
00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:17.021
Stop!
Stop in the name of the law!

92
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.240
Everybody. run!

93
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.400
Well. can't win them all.

94
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.920
Get out of the road. you dumb bunny!

95
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.560
Agree to disagree.

96
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.120
My hog rod!

97
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.637

98
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.477
Hopps and Wilde in pursuit of suspect
in a stolen catering van heading east-

99
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.760
Stop it!
Heading east through Sheepshire.

100
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.757
Beautiful!

101
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.521
I'll have what he's having.

102
00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:03.260
Darlin'. I believe your driving's
giving me some white hairs.

103
00:06:03.784 --> 00:06:06.277
Also. am I always gonna be
in the passenger seat?

104
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.760
- Cause if we're establishing sides-
- Back off. rookies!

105
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.831
Let the real teams handle it!

106
00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:14.499
Ma'am. we are a real team.

107
00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:15.840
Shortcut. take the tunnel.

108
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.758
Stand down. noobs.

109
00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:29.797
We got him. Rolling spikes!

110
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.177
Rolling spikes.

111
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.360
I hate that dumb bunny.

112
00:07:06.507 --> 00:07:07.704
I'm gonna jump.

113
00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:09.560
No. no. no. what.
what are you. you can't.

114
00:07:09.643 --> 00:07:11.842
Hey. I would like to call
a partner meeting!

115
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.847
You can't-

116
00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:14.197
Judy!

117
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.077
Please. join me in a moment of silence

118
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.240
for our beloved weather wall inventor.
Ebenezer Lynxley.

119
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:36.731
Zebros!

120
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.720
Reptile.

121
00:07:59.186 --> 00:08:02.000
Zootopia ain't just a mammal city.

122
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.396
It has a secret tiny reptile population.

123
00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:08.662
The most live abroad.

124
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.920
Of course. Zootopia does not allow snakes.

125
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.820
Ain't been one of those around
here for a at least 100 years.

126
00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.877
Scales and Tales of the Weird!

127
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.080
Yeah. not sure Nibbles Maplestick is
our most reliable source.

128
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.182
Bunny. orange dog. in here now.

129
00:08:30.032 --> 00:08:32.713
Sir. today may not have been ideal.
but the anteater was captured.

130
00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:35.143
- By the Zebros!
- Zebros!

131
00:08:35.168 --> 00:08:36.920
- Shut it!
- Zebros.

132
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:38.436
It was us.

133
00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:42.724
But more importantly. I believe we
may have made a significant discovery.

134
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.597
The stolen van contained a smuggled crate
from overseas. pamphlets for the Zootennial

135
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.477
and some type of reptile skin.

136
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.128
I've already sent samples for testing.

137
00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:53.684
What needs testing is you!

138
00:08:53.717 --> 00:08:56.036
You two tore up half the city!

139
00:08:56.061 --> 00:09:00.771
Because of you. we had to call in Jumbo
Unit to remove a dik-dik from a tuba!

140
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.600
- You're almost out!
- Please help! Please help!

141
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.195
- Who's catching him?
- Sorry.

142
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.600
could you show me that clip again?

143
00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:09.100
Wasn't wearing my glasses.

144
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.455
Did you or did you not disobey
a direct order to stand down?

145
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.557
Sir. we were in pursuit. and Article 6.
Paragraph B states if the lead officer-

146
00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:19.842
You are not lead officers!

147
00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:24.555
You're one-hit wonders who should go back
to meter maiding and slinging popsicles!

148
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.963
If I may. I think someone's just jealous
that we got to drive the squeal mobile.

149
00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:31.968
Or maybe you thought it was your mama.

150
00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:34.566
Enough!
Everybody. out!

151
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.528
Officer Hopps. despite my best
efforts to avoid it.

152
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:45.040
I like you.

153
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.497
But this need to overdo it

154
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.120
made both of you a headline today.

155
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.800
And it reflects badly on me. on the
department. and frankly. on any bunny

156
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.040
hoping to follow in your footsteps.

157
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.992
Not every case is going to save the world.

158
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.246
Knock. knock.

159
00:10:11.106 --> 00:10:11.720
Hi.

160
00:10:11.954 --> 00:10:15.875
You know this kinda. this sounds a lot like
just a you guys conversation.

161
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.177
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go ahead-

162
00:10:17.202 --> 00:10:20.240
Is there a reason why you
don't take anything seriously?

163
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.238
Jokes are a classic defense mechanism
for someone with a traumatic childhood.

164
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:25.325
Would you like a traumatic adulthood?

165
00:10:26.173 --> 00:10:26.951
I would not.

166
00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:31.307
I allowed you to work together
because you did this city a great service.

167
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.720
But today you messed it all up.

168
00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:37.960
And now. some are questioning whether you
should have been partners

169
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:38.985
- in the first place.
- But. Sir...

170
00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:43.996
So instead of chasing imaginary reptiles.
I am pulling you from the field.

171
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.664
- What?
- And giving you a new assignment

172
00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:50.101
reserved for special teams 
like yourselves.

173
00:10:50.302 --> 00:10:55.447
Fail at this. and I will have
no choice but to split you up.

174
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:57.360
There will be no more Hopps and Wilde.

175
00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:05.240
But if you're good as you think you are.
this is your moment to shine.

176
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.019
Welcome to Partners in Crisis. a
workshop for duos heading for disaster.

177
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.595
I'm your therapy animal. Dr. Fuzzby.
and you are here because

178
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.539
mismatched pairings often need a little
more work to make them work.

179
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.173
Greg?
We talked about that.

180
00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:28.985
What are we making Marlon?
Uncomfortable.

181
00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:29.822
Yes.

182
00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:35.034
And Francine. Clark may be
a mouse. but he is your partner first.

183
00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:38.985
And we have two new partners.

184
00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:43.383
Can you tell us about your
journey to dysfunction junction?

185
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:49.342
Well. we've been official
partners for one week. happy anniversary.

186
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:52.434
And we are not dysfunctional
at all. actually.

187
00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.253
Functioning fine. better than fine.

188
00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:56.427
And we did sorta save the city.

189
00:11:56.452 --> 00:11:59.990
So. us being here kinda seems like
a huge misunderstanding.

190
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:03.895
Notice how she answered first.
did not allow her partner to speak.

191
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.059
seems to be in a state of denial.
and taps her foot

192
00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:07.769
when she's suppressing discomfort.

193
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.575
And observe the source of her
discomfort.

194
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.599
represented by the 
disconnected affectation

195
00:12:12.624 --> 00:12:14.588
of her emotionally insecure partner.

196
00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:18.930
But with hard work. they'll
be on the same page by year two!

197
00:12:19.298 --> 00:12:22.557
But for now. let's begin
by greeting our teammate.

198
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:25.011
Who'd like to go first?
Thank you. Joel.

199
00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:30.883
Okay. unfortunately. Karen has chosen

200
00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:33.617
to see Joel's smile as 
a sign of aggression.

201
00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:35.221
Hackles down. Karen.

202
00:12:35.246 --> 00:12:36.775
Karen. hackles down.

203
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.720
Joel. the safe word is. "coconut!"

204
00:12:39.109 --> 00:12:40.101
Coconut!

205
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.191
Okay. we have to set another
meeting with the chief.

206
00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:46.720
Promise we'll be better.

207
00:12:48.103 --> 00:12:49.287
Zebros...

208
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.334
You talk back less.
Maybe not at all.

209
00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:56.251
Yeah. or we go with my playbook
and we just lay low.

210
00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:59.535
We cannot prove ourselves if
we are stuck in that room.

211
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.400
And if we complain to Chief Beef.
he'll just make us stay longer.

212
00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:06.162
Play it smart. stay off the radar.
and don't let it get to you. okay?

213
00:13:06.262 --> 00:13:08.807
Cause we are the dream team.

214
00:13:11.384 --> 00:13:12.464
Sorry. Paul.

215
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.200
Oh. roll out the red carpet.

216
00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:18.560
Here's the Supercops.

217
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.095
What does the fox say?

218
00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:23.628
- You suck.
- Easy. partner.

219
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.940
Let me ask you something.

220
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.557
- Do you think we're a good team?
- Of course.

221
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.104
I just... I just wish I knew what we had to do
to prove it to everyone else.

222
00:13:33.182 --> 00:13:36.552
Or maybe we don't have
to prove anything to anybody.

223
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.570
We do.

224
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.718
Forever.

225
00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:45.840
And the sooner everyone sees a fox and a
bunny can be great partners. the better.

226
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.766
Enjoy it.
I got two.

227
00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:49.485
I'd rather chew off my own arm.

228
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.940
Happy anniversary!

229
00:14:26.608 --> 00:14:29.975
So. saw you on TV. You okay?

230
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.255
- Everything's fine. mom.
- Uh-oh.

231
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.160
Everyone knows fine is a cry for help.

232
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.600
You know who else cried for help?

233
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.455
That dik-dik stuck in that tuba.

234
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.655
Oh. him and the dik-dik.

235
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.215
What does your fox partner say?

236
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.040
Well. Nick's not really a talker.

237
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.244
Well. you two are very different.

238
00:14:47.568 --> 00:14:49.655
Small town hero. raised on a farm.

239
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.735
Big city crook. raised on the streets.

240
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.295
I pray every day that you'll
come back home and make babies.

241
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.120
Just remember the first
rule of partnerships.

242
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.175
- You can be right or you can be happy.
- That's true.

243
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.295
There's nothing wrong with dying a little
inside so you can meet in the middle.

244
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.615
Honey. you're pushing me out.

245
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.775
I want to make sure I can be seen.

246
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.520
- Well. if she could see both of us.
- Okay. gotta go!

247
00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:08.695
- Work to do.
- Bye. bun-bun.

248
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.840
Everything's gonna be fine.

249
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:11.615
- You two just need a new case.
- Got it.

250
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.200
- Love you.
- Hey. maybe try to find that dik-dik!

251
00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:13.680
Bye.

252
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.520
Ding-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!

253
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.008
Squeal of Fortune!

254
00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:32.088
Tomorrow's weather is. again. everything!

255
00:15:32.112 --> 00:15:36.697
To announce that the long-awaited
Tundratown expansion will be starting soon.

256
00:15:36.809 --> 00:15:40.715
Residents continue to raise concerns
about the future of their neighborhood.

257
00:15:40.994 --> 00:15:46.775
But tonight. we put our differences
aside and celebrate at the Zootennial Gala.

258
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.975
where the Lynxley Journal will be
on display for the first time

259
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.963
in a century. following
an infamous reptile attack.

260
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:58.115
The Lynxley Journal.
containing the patented weather wall plans.

261
00:15:58.204 --> 00:16:01.560
was originally written by Ebenezer Lynxley.
bringing the whole-

262
00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:19.019
Same catering company.

263
00:16:32.005 --> 00:16:33.400
The Lynxley Journal.

264
00:16:41.878 --> 00:16:43.112
Truth bomb!

265
00:16:43.137 --> 00:16:47.720
The 100th anniversary of the weather walls
is also the 100th anniversary

266
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.480
of Zootopia's only snake attack.

267
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.925
The victim?
A tortoise.

268
00:16:53.003 --> 00:16:57.595
The Lynxley family maid.
who was fanged while stopping

269
00:16:57.624 --> 00:17:01.485
a venomous snake from
stealing the Lynxley Journal.

270
00:17:01.742 --> 00:17:08.293
No one has seen a snake in Zootopia since.
but I'm convinced one will return.

271
00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:14.880
My only question is. is he going to be
wearing half a pants or one long sock?

272
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.240
You say justice is dead.

273
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.800
I say neigh!

274
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.295
Well. well. you missed me already. huh?

275
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.691
The stolen van with the snake skin

276
00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:35.411
is from the same catering company
that's working the gala.

277
00:17:35.447 --> 00:17:38.491
- This is you studying your partner book?
- Listen to me.

278
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.280
Venomous snakes tried to steal
the Lynxley's journal before.

279
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.415
What if they're back
in town to steal it again?

280
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.040
No snake has set foot
in Zootopia in forever.

281
00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:48.918
Okay? Even if they had feet.

282
00:17:49.085 --> 00:17:50.440
Look. we're already in the hot seat. Carrots.

283
00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:51.921
And pizza's here.
Gotta go-

284
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.040
If there's a fanging at the gala and we
do nothing to stop it.

285
00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:55.793
then we are not doing our jobs.

286
00:17:56.061 --> 00:17:56.735
Yikes.

287
00:17:56.771 --> 00:17:58.751
No wonder you
never invite me over.

288
00:17:58.808 --> 00:18:00.124
Foxes are solitary.

289
00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:03.855
And look. we go and you're wrong.
Chief Beef will split us up.

290
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.050
And if we don't get a win soon and prove
we're great partners.

291
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.959
the chief will split us up anyway.

292
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.688
Check the perimeter. snoop a little.

293
00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:11.120
We find nothing. we bail.

294
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.640
But if I'm right. no one will question
whether you and I belong together again.

295
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.550
We need this.

296
00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:20.269
Fine.

297
00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:22.500
But we'll still have
to get through security.

298
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.061
And in fancy town.
a fox and a bunny won't exactly blend in.

299
00:18:26.318 --> 00:18:28.780
That's why we'll be undercover!

300
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.015
See. you're still
in the driver's seat.

- Star of the Revenge Trilogy. The Neighsayer.

And that. and that one. and then this one.

This one's warmer.

330
00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:33.295
Reptile in Tundratown 
might need that to survive the cold.

331
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.043
Oh my God. a viper!

332
00:20:37.523 --> 00:20:40.001
A window viper.
Yeah?

333
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.838
Backdoor ajar.

334
00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:47.520
Anyone could
have left it like that.

335
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.001
And you said snoop a little.
not break and ent-

336
00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:53.455
Oh. we were always going inside.
Got it.

337
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.021
Same page means your page.

338
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:56.530
It's called a hustle. sweetheart.

339
00:20:56.554 --> 00:20:58.249
You change out here.
I get the van.

340
00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:18.140
It's the Zootennial Gala.
a bunny comes prepared.

341
00:21:20.726 --> 00:21:24.075
You know I used to dream of
infiltrating a place like this.

342
00:21:30.514 --> 00:21:33.800
You know. this is not your worst idea.

343
00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:36.160
Wow. that was almost a compliment.

344
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.729
Your worst idea is what
you did with your ears.

345
00:21:40.645 --> 00:21:41.419
Alright.

346
00:21:54.164 --> 00:22:00.935
Welcome to the Zootennial Gala.
Featuring the original Lynxley Journal.

347
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.180
Why would a snake want to
steal some old book anyway?

348
00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:06.469
I don't know.

349
00:22:08.014 --> 00:22:11.700
But no one is gonna steal it
because we are here to protect it.

350
00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:17.600
The journal is in the reserved section.

351
00:22:18.238 --> 00:22:18.800
Okay.

352
00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:22.155
- Come on.
- Slow down.

353
00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:25.759
You want to fit in?
Commando is not gonna cut it.

354
00:22:26.206 --> 00:22:27.960
It's not just the clothes. mkay?

355
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.821
It is the vibe.

356
00:22:30.022 --> 00:22:31.094
Good to see ya.

357
00:22:31.205 --> 00:22:32.479
Hey. real nice humps.

358
00:22:32.733 --> 00:22:35.053
Oh. is that real mink?
It's real fox.

359
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:38.092
Get invited to a lot of these?

360
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.280
Invited?
No.

361
00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:42.568
But there's other reasons to hobnob.

362
00:22:44.555 --> 00:22:47.018
Madam. excuse me.
Is this yours?

363
00:22:47.043 --> 00:22:48.617
Why. yes.

364
00:22:48.662 --> 00:22:50.202
Well. allow me.

365
00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:56.173
Clever fox.
Ooh. there.

366
00:22:56.866 --> 00:22:59.354
I don't think it has enough guards.

367
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.088
I'll get a closer look.
Watch my six.

368
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:10.401
Bogo alert.

369
00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:25.883
Cover's made of metal.

370
00:23:25.908 --> 00:23:29.542
Gruffalo Buffalo has joined the mix.
Three o'clock.

371
00:23:37.947 --> 00:23:40.001
- Oh. excuse me.
- Oh no. sorry.

372
00:23:40.026 --> 00:23:43.115
- I am so sorry.
- Here. let me just. oh nope-

373
00:23:43.204 --> 00:23:45.500
That belongs to you. I apologize.

374
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:47.903
Oh gosh. he hates me.

375
00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:50.458
- Here.
- Ah. you're my hero.

376
00:23:50.658 --> 00:23:54.175
Well. I just like to be prepared for
any possible scenario.

377
00:23:54.443 --> 00:23:56.831
Which is not a weird thing to say at a party.

378
00:23:56.954 --> 00:24:00.336
Well. I just mopped a spill
with that guy's tail. so...

379
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.120
Paw!

380
00:24:03.941 --> 00:24:06.072
Pawbert! I am Pawbert! Hi.

381
00:24:06.307 --> 00:24:09.901
- Judy. I'm Judy Hopps.
- Ah. what the pork?

382
00:24:09.934 --> 00:24:12.166
Well. 'tis nice to meet you Judy-

383
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:14.500
Wait. Judy Hopps. the Judy Hopps?

384
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.200
Are you working this?

385
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.080
I mean. you're clearly working it.

386
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.440
But are you actually working this?

387
00:24:21.217 --> 00:24:22.815
No. I'm actually...

388
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.975
Well. it's just a hunch.

389
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.520
Protecting that.

390
00:24:26.597 --> 00:24:29.543
Good.
I don't think it has enough guards.

391
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.028
Uh. that was my joke.

392
00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:32.840
And there's nothing here.

393
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.369
Let's call it a night.
Hopps?

394
00:24:42.088 --> 00:24:43.079
Well. we should...

395
00:24:43.104 --> 00:24:44.742
It was nice to meet you.

396
00:24:44.767 --> 00:24:45.916
Yes. and you?

397
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.222
Bon appétit.

398
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.195
If at any point tonight you
choose to eat. bon appétit then.

399
00:24:51.496 --> 00:24:53.840
You're supposed to be off stage. Pawbert.

400
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.918
- Yeah. get off stage. Pawbert.
- Wait are-

401
00:24:56.943 --> 00:24:59.956
- Are you?
- Yeah. I am a Lynxley.

402
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.735
Or. you know. I'm trying to be.

403
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.015
Now. Pawbert.
Come on. pappy.

404
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.255
I got you. pa. don't you worry.

405
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.255
No. I have him.

406
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.160
All right. let's get this thing started.

407
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.815
- Welcome to the Zootennial Gala.
- Hey. Hopps.

408
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.640
I think I might actually...

409
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.920
I think I've got something!

410
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.520
Look at you all.

411
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.599
Good to see you.

412
00:25:25.124 --> 00:25:29.333
It is with great pleasure that I introduce
the third generation...

413
00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:31.735
Carrots. can you hear me?
I have a trail.

414
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.167
The legacy of our great
city. Milton Lynxley!

415
00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:38.075
- Thank you.
- Carrots.

416
00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:39.780
- Thank you very much.
- Carrots!

417
00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:42.455
What are you doing here?

418
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.931
- Chief. she was right.
- You're done.

419
00:25:44.956 --> 00:25:45.933
You're both done.

420
00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:49.901
My grandpa had a dream
to build a city for all of us...

421
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:50.635
Nick?

422
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.542
To truly be better together.

423
00:26:05.917 --> 00:26:07.200
There's a snake!

424
00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:10.292
Go. go. go!

425
00:26:10.492 --> 00:26:12.408
I will remember you. zebra!

426
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:36.875
Judy! Judy!

427
00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.042
I knew it!

428
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.980
Stop!

429
00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:05.480
Please. you don't have to hurt him.

430
00:27:06.938 --> 00:27:07.914
Hurt him?

431
00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:12.458
Snakes never hurt anyone.

432
00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:14.767
We aren't the bad guys.

433
00:27:15.379 --> 00:27:16.351
They are.

434
00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:22.132
And this journal
holds the secret that will prove it.

435
00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:26.900
I have to prove it.
Please.

436
00:27:28.903 --> 00:27:31.663
This is our only chance to set things right.

437
00:27:32.378 --> 00:27:38.560
And when I do. my family
will finally be able to come home.

438
00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:40.725
Oh no!

439
00:27:41.102 --> 00:27:41.971
I am here!

440
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.336
Hopps and Wilde. dream team.
We got him.

441
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.180
Or her.
Reptiles. it's like. who knows?

442
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.600
The cops are right behind us.

443
00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:54.421
Kill the snake.

444
00:27:54.499 --> 00:27:55.675
We'll burn the journal.

445
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.020
If he wants it. it's dangerous.

446
00:27:58.917 --> 00:28:03.405
And then you two will file a report
that he attacked us

447
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.680
and you will keep your mouths shut.

448
00:28:09.472 --> 00:28:10.905
Step aside.

449
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.840
Put out the fire!

450
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.773
- Carrots. come on!
- Help me save him!

451
00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:20.068
- Carrots. we need-
- Nick!

452
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.840
Cold!
Cold!

453
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:30.833
Chief!

454
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.369
He'll be okay.
Anti-venom.

455
00:28:33.394 --> 00:28:35.514
- He can be saved with anti-venom.
- Hopps!

456
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.021
What did you do?

457
00:28:37.121 --> 00:28:38.655
- Hoggbottom!
- They're helping the snake!

458
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.880
They're trying to kill the chief!

459
00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:41.307
Hoggbottom. no. please-

460
00:28:41.351 --> 00:28:42.947
My page.
Let's go.

461
00:28:42.972 --> 00:28:44.255
Wait. wait. wait. I need the journal!

462
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.880
And probably a sweater!

463
00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:50.269
Cold!

464
00:28:56.988 --> 00:28:58.625
Next time. we stay home?

465
00:29:03.606 --> 00:29:05.195
No. stop them!

466
00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:06.750
- Wait!
- Come on. come on.

467
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.260
Stop!

468
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:15.846
- <i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>
- Accident.

469
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:17.356
Your words. not mine.

470
00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:28.144
Put 'em in the trunk.

471
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:29.319
What?

472
00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:42.080
Ter-roar in Tundratown!

473
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.480
A fanging at the fiesta.

474
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.280
A hooowl at the gala as a venomous snake
attacks the founding family.

475
00:29:48.305 --> 00:29:51.542
More shocking.
the snake was aided by embattled ZPD officers

476
00:29:51.567 --> 00:29:53.494
Nicholas Wilde and Judy Hopps.

477
00:29:53.528 --> 00:29:57.695
All three now suspects in the tragic
fanging of Zootopia's chief of police

478
00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.800
and considered extremely dangerous.

479
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.510
Chief Bogo is dead.

480
00:30:06.458 --> 00:30:08.120
Those are words I'm glad I don't have to say.

481
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.375
I might have to soon

482
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.980
the doctor's a little weirded out.
but what has happened tonight

483
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.820
was more than horseplay!

484
00:30:23.137 --> 00:30:25.295
We're going to take that snake down.

485
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.420
And the fox and that rabbit.

486
00:30:29.543 --> 00:30:33.083
Do you know how many
mayors they've already destroyed?

487
00:30:35.202 --> 00:30:37.560
One... Two...

488
00:30:38.191 --> 00:30:39.446
I got up to two.

489
00:30:39.543 --> 00:30:41.660
Would you like to be three?

490
00:30:42.713 --> 00:30:45.220
I want them gone.

491
00:30:46.206 --> 00:30:49.867
But aren't there laws?

492
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:54.744
I will say this once. Brian.

493
00:30:55.168 --> 00:31:00.079
You will retrieve the journal
and bury them.

494
00:31:01.463 --> 00:31:05.101
Or maybe I chose the wrong mayor.

495
00:31:07.055 --> 00:31:10.358
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

496
00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:05.213
Hey. the phone
is the first thing they'll track.

497
00:32:06.295 --> 00:32:07.128
Sorry.

498
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.043
I have never been on the run
from the law before.

499
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.461
Yeah. boy.

500
00:32:13.572 --> 00:32:15.940
It's almost like we shouldn't
have gone to that gala.

501
00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:19.284
Okay. we already did it your way.

502
00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:21.835
With Mr. Big. we do it mine.

503
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.084
This is where having a partner from the
underworld is really gonna pay off.

504
00:32:26.842 --> 00:32:29.108
Raymond!
And is that Kev-

505
00:32:53.628 --> 00:32:56.195
Welcome to my warehouse!

506
00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:57.947
Oh my God. I love your dress!

507
00:32:58.048 --> 00:32:59.666
Oh. thank you.

508
00:33:00.738 --> 00:33:04.532
Fru Fru and I are now
equal partners in the family business.

509
00:33:04.867 --> 00:33:09.000
She brings wonderful ideas for crime
and for fashion

510
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.480
while I get more time to focus
on what matters most.

511
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.015
being grandpapa to my little Judith.

512
00:33:17.088 --> 00:33:18.985
Kiss my ring.

513
00:33:19.443 --> 00:33:22.021
- Kiss the stinking ring right now! Kiss it!
- Kiss it right now! Kiss it!

514
00:33:23.773 --> 00:33:28.639
Nonno. you said we were going to make
some nice shoes for Mr. Weaselton.

515
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:31.675
- That's my girl!
- They grow up so fast.

516
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.840
- You run your mouth too much!
- Shut your mouth. fox!

517
00:33:35.224 --> 00:33:41.340
Anyways. you're in trouble. and we like...
one of yous. so we're here to help.

518
00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:45.693
New clothes. new identities.
truck out of town. leave in an hour.

519
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.260
and your meter maid car is taken care of.

520
00:33:51.781 --> 00:33:53.349
I think you misunderstand.

521
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.815
We've been framed by the lynxes
and an innocent snake-

522
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:02.579
Judy. the lynxes are killers.
and they have no honor.

523
00:34:02.947 --> 00:34:07.557
And this Tundratown expansion
only makes them more dangerous.

524
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:11.700
Territorial animals will
do anything for more land.

525
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.020
So if whatever you're tangled up in.
threatens their plans. you're dead.

526
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.920
You don't fight the cats.

527
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.800
You leave.

528
00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:25.436
Sir. I know you're trying 
to look out for us. but we took an oath

529
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.835
to protect this city. and justice doesn't run!

530
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.555
On behalf of myself.
Rick Wilde and Ms. Trudy Cabbagepatch.

531
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.787
We thank you for your truck to salvation.

532
00:34:36.876 --> 00:34:38.255
We cannot accept your offer.

533
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.520
We are helping that snake.

534
00:34:40.026 --> 00:34:41.826
Boy. you're really
tossing that 'we' around.

535
00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:44.822
Snakes may have been framed
for the fanging of that tortoise.

536
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.041
Do you have any idea why or
how this book could prove it?

537
00:34:49.097 --> 00:34:50.760
I wish I did.

538
00:34:51.028 --> 00:34:56.876
But if it has to do with snakes.
your best bet is talking to a reptile.

539
00:34:57.338 --> 00:34:59.019
Do you know any?

540
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.000
Almost no one does.

541
00:35:01.207 --> 00:35:05.407
They keep to themselves.
hide out in Marsh Market.

542
00:35:05.626 --> 00:35:07.476
But you can still find them.

543
00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:12.624
You just need a reptile expert.
someone local who knows where to go.

544
00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:14.789
Lucky for you. I met someone.

545
00:35:14.889 --> 00:35:16.842
She runs a podcast.

546
00:35:17.278 --> 00:35:17.975
No. no.

547
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.041
Trudy Cabbagepatch.

548
00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.640
Rick Wilde says no.

549
00:35:21.842 --> 00:35:23.706
Oh. yeah!

550
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:27.133
Hopps and Wilde are on the land.

551
00:35:27.177 --> 00:35:30.570
Subtle sleuthing. 'tis my jam!

552
00:35:30.749 --> 00:35:33.400
Mind the splinters.
Oh. you called the right beaver.

553
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.586
If you want to talk to a reptile.
I am your gal.

554
00:35:36.619 --> 00:35:41.296
Also. if you need to talk to a jackalope.
which are real. mom!

555
00:35:41.374 --> 00:35:43.595
Excuse us.
Team meeting.

556
00:35:43.751 --> 00:35:45.928
Vetoing the beave. new vote.

557
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.465
all in favor of 'truck to being alive
and laying low till this blows over'-bill?

558
00:35:49.923 --> 00:35:50.435
I mean...

559
00:35:50.526 --> 00:35:52.417
Hopps and Wilde do not bail on a case.

560
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.333
But she's crazy.

561
00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:56.333
Probably lead poisoning
from eating too many pencils.

562
00:35:59.097 --> 00:36:01.083
Do you know a reptile who can tell
us the hidden secret in here

563
00:36:01.167 --> 00:36:02.825
why the lynxes framed the snakes?

564
00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:06.675
24 hours. Sunrise tomorrow.

565
00:36:06.742 --> 00:36:10.917
If we strike out. then we go into hiding.
and Judy Cabbagepatch it is.

566
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.805
It's Trudy Cabbagepatch.
and the safe word is "coconut."

567
00:36:15.838 --> 00:36:19.583
In the darkness. of a dank underpass.
they stepped into the vehicle

568
00:36:19.667 --> 00:36:22.880
not realizing
their lives were about to change.

569
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.055
Because we're going to meet a reptile?

570
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:30.046
Because you're about to be
best buds with Nibbles Maplestick!

571
00:36:30.425 --> 00:36:34.030
Takes two to tango.
but a threesome to be some!

572
00:36:34.142 --> 00:36:37.635
Let's find you a reptile and
rock the swamp!

573
00:36:45.467 --> 00:36:47.426
Breathe it in!

574
00:36:52.255 --> 00:36:54.867
Now if any reptile would know
the secret of that book

575
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:56.195
and why the snake wants it-

576
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:56.833
Hey. Johnny.

577
00:36:58.188 --> 00:37:00.424
It's my lizard friend Jesús.

578
00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:03.660
Why would a lizard hide here?

579
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.494
Well. when Zootopia was founded.
the whole neighborhood

580
00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:10.200
got cut off from the rest of the town.

581
00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:12.077
Kind of on our own here.

582
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.895
Yeah. it's probably why reptiles like it.

583
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.720
They can just do their thing.

584
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.930
Plus. it's the only place in town 
you can get away with

585
00:37:18.955 --> 00:37:21.061
wearing a shirt and no pants.

586
00:37:21.184 --> 00:37:24.042
Loving tour time with Woodchuckles.
Great call.

587
00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.195
- We need her.
- Oh. yeah.

588
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:29.387
Like a hole in the head.
Bad timing.

589
00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:34.175
Okay. to get to Jesús' hideout.
we gotta take a ferry.

590
00:37:34.342 --> 00:37:35.715
Just let me handle the locals.

591
00:37:35.749 --> 00:37:38.415
Water folk tend to be a little
stand-offish around landies.

592
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.840
Well. I've been hustling
the streets since I was twelve.

593
00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:43.200
I think I can handle a juggling seal.

594
00:37:45.291 --> 00:37:46.813
Sea lion.

595
00:37:46.854 --> 00:37:48.238
He's not from around here.

596
00:37:48.305 --> 00:37:49.520
But coin's a coin.

597
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.380
Oh. no. change...

598
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.517
...is a choking hazard.

599
00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:55.023
Well. honest mistake.

600
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.975
Do not do that!

601
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.440
Let's let Nibbles handle this.

602
00:37:59.582 --> 00:38:01.161
Thank you. Judith.

603
00:38:01.318 --> 00:38:03.695
Conversing with these
beautiful sea creatures

604
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.667
is like talking to anyone a little different.

605
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.958
Just takes open and
respectful communication.

606
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:19.708
- Hey Bub.
- Hey Bub.

607
00:38:19.792 --> 00:38:21.367
- Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub.
- Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub. Bub.

608
00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:22.750
- Hey Bub.
- Hey Bub.

609
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.125
- Hey Bub. Bubbybub.
- Hey Bub. hey Bub.

610
00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:26.325
- Hey Bub. Bub.
- Hey Bub.

611
00:38:27.292 --> 00:38:29.192
- Seen Jesús?
- Yup.

612
00:38:35.648 --> 00:38:37.958
And now. we leave town.

613
00:38:52.802 --> 00:38:54.808
Thank you for this.

614
00:38:55.235 --> 00:38:56.433
Happy anniversary.

615
00:38:56.544 --> 00:38:59.186
Oh? It's your anniversary?

616
00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:02.895
♪ This is the night ♪

617
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:11.167
♪ It's a beautiful night.
and we call it bella notte ♪

618
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.340
How are we going to find them now?

619
00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.383
Thanks. seal.

620
00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

621
00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:35.951
Just a little farther.

622
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:40.335
Jesús and all the answers you'll
ever need are right here at the end

623
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.171
of this very scary dark hallway.

624
00:39:43.226 --> 00:39:47.015
Boy. this is so much better than
sitting on a beach on Outback Island

625
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.142
sipping piña koalas.

626
00:39:49.543 --> 00:39:54.695
We are not skipping town when there is
an innocent snake out there who needs us.

627
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.300
He's got help.

628
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.940
His motorcycle buddy.

629
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:00.510
You are acting weird.

630
00:40:00.535 --> 00:40:01.652
What is your problem?

631
00:40:01.742 --> 00:40:06.921
Well. A. you railroaded me. and B.
if you must know.

632
00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:11.875
I have an aversion to reptiles.

633
00:40:12.356 --> 00:40:13.058
What?

634
00:40:13.104 --> 00:40:16.917
Oh. is my discomfort hilarious to you?

635
00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:18.796
Y-No. you-
I'm sorry. you're right.

636
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.441
We are partners.
and whenever I'm uncomfortable

637
00:40:21.474 --> 00:40:24.052
you are always every considerate
of my feelings.

638
00:40:24.086 --> 00:40:25.113
Look out. snake skin!

639
00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:27.699
I'm slipping. I'm slipping.
I'm slipping. hold the rail!

640
00:40:27.724 --> 00:40:28.975
- Hold the rail. hold it. hold it.
- I'm holding it.

641
00:40:29.019 --> 00:40:30.347
- Stop holding my ears!
- Hold it. hold it!

642
00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.780
- Never pull a bunny's ears!
- Hold the rail!

643
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.958
I think the real mystery

644
00:40:38.375 --> 00:40:40.542
is how you two ever solved anything!

645
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:44.571
Anywho. let's see what Jesús
has to say about your journal.

646
00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:47.242
Oh. and if he offers you food. accept.

647
00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:51.208
Declining is a sign of disrespect.
To all of them.

648
00:40:51.508 --> 00:40:53.070
All of them?

649
00:41:17.484 --> 00:41:18.484
Order up.

650
00:41:20.157 --> 00:41:21.530
Hey. another drink.

651
00:41:28.417 --> 00:41:29.817
So warm.

652
00:41:32.716 --> 00:41:33.472
Whoops.

653
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:38.639
Keep it.

654
00:41:42.735 --> 00:41:44.208
Jesús!

655
00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:47.166
Allow me to introduce my friends

656
00:41:47.222 --> 00:41:48.874
this is Judith and Nicholas.

657
00:41:48.952 --> 00:41:51.943
they are wanted fugitives
investigating a snake mystery

658
00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:54.842
and trying not to get murdered.
May we sit?

659
00:41:58.882 --> 00:41:59.531
Okay.

660
00:42:06.363 --> 00:42:08.717
Oh I'm good. but these guys look hungry.

661
00:42:12.858 --> 00:42:14.333
Thank you for meeting with us.

662
00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:17.625
We believe snakes were framed
for something in this journal

663
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.920
- perhaps pertaining to-
- Eat first.

664
00:42:20.338 --> 00:42:21.913
Talk second.

665
00:42:22.512 --> 00:42:23.137
Oh.

666
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:01.792
Hey guys. they ate it!

667
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:04.387
Look at their faces!

668
00:43:05.167 --> 00:43:06.708
I don't eat grubs.

669
00:43:06.908 --> 00:43:08.933
Hermano. get me a scone.

670
00:43:10.208 --> 00:43:11.458
Okay. okay.

671
00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:15.891
Metal cover.

672
00:43:17.523 --> 00:43:18.996
And what does that mean?

673
00:43:19.197 --> 00:43:22.660
It means it's fancy.

674
00:43:23.773 --> 00:43:29.220
It also means the secret you're looking
for is probably right on the cover.

675
00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:34.700
Somehow vipers can see things
in the middle. even under the paint.

676
00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:39.142
This is Ebonezer Lynxley's
original journal for the weather walls.

677
00:43:39.253 --> 00:43:42.992
Why would he hide a secret for a snake?

678
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:48.584
I don't know. but it must have been big
cause a tortoise died for it.

679
00:43:48.907 --> 00:43:52.640
I am guessing that it was a slow death.

680
00:43:56.128 --> 00:43:59.945
The fanging didn't just
change how folks saw snakes.

681
00:44:00.436 --> 00:44:03.829
No mammals trusted any reptile after that.

682
00:44:05.135 --> 00:44:07.334
That's why we all left.

683
00:44:08.037 --> 00:44:12.746
And that's when the Lynxleys
expanded Tundratown the first time.

684
00:44:13.807 --> 00:44:15.682
And it's happening again.

685
00:44:17.177 --> 00:44:19.700
The expansion is going here.

686
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.171
Marsh Market will be buried in snow.

687
00:44:24.298 --> 00:44:26.072
We'll all get pushed out.

688
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.980
Those lynxes will get more land.
and there's no way to stop them.

689
00:44:38.751 --> 00:44:42.345
What if the secret hidden in here could?

690
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:49.834
Then I would say holding it puts
the two of you in grave danger.

691
00:44:57.742 --> 00:44:59.483
They tracked you?

692
00:45:01.225 --> 00:45:02.008
Whoops.

693
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.915
It's the ZPD!

694
00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:11.295
Follow me.

695
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.440
Come on.

696
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.166
Wait. why are you helping us?

697
00:45:17.244 --> 00:45:19.409
You two saved this city once.

698
00:45:19.644 --> 00:45:21.608
I reckon you can save it again.

699
00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:27.240
And when you do. maybe everyone
will see we ain't that different.

700
00:45:32.338 --> 00:45:32.921
Huh.

701
00:45:36.017 --> 00:45:39.295
I'm really sorry. but this is
my family's only chance to come home.

702
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.542
Wait. we want to help!

703
00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:41.958
Wait. wait!

704
00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:44.275
Come back!

705
00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.458
There's no path.
Take the docks.

706
00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:48.215
Carrots!

707
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.815
Wait!
We believe you.

708
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.250
Nick. come on. come on.

709
00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:03.371
Grab it!

710
00:46:10.083 --> 00:46:11.485
I got eyes on them.

711
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:13.789
- They're heading for the tubes!
- In pursuit.

712
00:46:30.649 --> 00:46:31.731
- Hey Bubba.
- Hey Bub.

713
00:46:31.776 --> 00:46:33.776
- Hey Bub.
- Hey Bub.

714
00:46:34.129 --> 00:46:34.754
Go!

715
00:46:36.217 --> 00:46:38.217
- Hey Bub.
- Bye-bye.

716
00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:49.142
One tip.

717
00:46:49.175 --> 00:46:52.780
If he goes for the red
line. do not follow.

718
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.255
You will run out of air.
Good luck.

719
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.455
I love you.

720
00:47:04.249 --> 00:47:05.290
Cannonball!

721
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.775
No. that's a red line.
Red line. red line!

722
00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.760
You're going to run out of air!

723
00:47:10.885 --> 00:47:12.400
Coconut. coconut!

724
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.615
Anything you need. I got them.

725
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.375
Sequels. prequels. requels.

726
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.640
Who says the industry's
going down the tube?

727
00:48:30.179 --> 00:48:32.222
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

728
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:33.259
Yes.

729
00:48:34.334 --> 00:48:34.912
You?

730
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.086
Well. I-I feel like some...

731
00:48:39.744 --> 00:48:41.999
Some sorries may be in order.

732
00:48:42.646 --> 00:48:44.465
Nick. it's okay.

733
00:48:45.113 --> 00:48:47.300
I know you didn't want
to lose him on purpose.

734
00:48:48.572 --> 00:48:51.396
Oh. not me sorry.
No. no.

735
00:48:51.508 --> 00:48:52.869
You sorry.

736
00:48:53.695 --> 00:48:58.818
Well. now we kinda have no way to find
him or stop the lynxes. so...

737
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:00.391
Agree to disagree.

738
00:49:01.318 --> 00:49:03.706
But we are alive.

739
00:49:04.052 --> 00:49:06.430
So if we can't find him. that's great.

740
00:49:06.508 --> 00:49:09.333
What we can find is a truck out of here.

741
00:49:23.115 --> 00:49:25.659
Box of old matches.
Helpful.

742
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.845
Trudy Cabbagepatch. leaving town.
We're done.

743
00:49:30.244 --> 00:49:31.787
Yodelay hee-hoo!

744
00:49:32.389 --> 00:49:35.503
- This is weird place for you to be.
- Ja. very weird.

745
00:49:35.583 --> 00:49:37.389
You there fell out of the tube.

746
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:39.284
Okay. we will call police to help.

747
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.827
No! No. no. we're fine.

748
00:49:40.882 --> 00:49:42.858
Yeah. but we were just leaving town.

749
00:49:42.992 --> 00:49:47.534
Actually. um. do you
happen to know where this tube goes?

750
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.655
- Copenhoofen.
- Ja. is Copenhoofen.

751
00:49:49.805 --> 00:49:50.927
Got it. thank y-

752
00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:53.796
Ah. you chew too much.
this is not-

753
00:49:59.543 --> 00:50:01.742
Where did- Where did
you find these flowers?

754
00:50:01.809 --> 00:50:04.532
Oh. the Liebchen flower?
At the tippity-top of the mountain.

755
00:50:04.658 --> 00:50:06.125
This is only place they grow.

756
00:50:07.255 --> 00:50:07.780
Is...

757
00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:13.092
- Is there anything else up there?
- Nope. there sure isn't.

758
00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:15.180
Oh ja. old Honeymoon Lodge.

759
00:50:15.235 --> 00:50:18.405
What is closed for a long
time was hideout for snakes.

760
00:50:20.316 --> 00:50:21.675
Honeymoon Lodge?

761
00:50:21.753 --> 00:50:24.585
How- How do you reach it?

762
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:29.342
- Oh. tourist takes the tram from Copenhoofen.
- But the rope is faster.

763
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.351
Good luck.

764
00:50:31.385 --> 00:50:34.231
- Have fun at the Honeymoon Lodge!
- Thank you.

765
00:50:40.726 --> 00:50:44.432
What does this secret have to do
with the reptiles leaving town?

766
00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:48.201
How did it get hidden in
the journal in the first place?

767
00:50:48.226 --> 00:50:49.990
Will you slow down?

768
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.667
How long do you think it's gonna be
before Hoggbottom and the ZPD

769
00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.875
figure out where we are?

770
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.708
If anything. we should be going faster.

771
00:50:59.922 --> 00:51:01.340
As I always say...

772
00:51:01.365 --> 00:51:04.417
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

773
00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:05.792
Nick...

774
00:51:06.206 --> 00:51:10.313
<i>I-I-I really am du-du-du-
dumb bunny.</i>

775
00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:12.512
<i>Just dumb-du-du-du-dumb bunny.</i>

776
00:51:12.563 --> 00:51:13.818
This was a gift.

777
00:51:13.918 --> 00:51:15.704
To symbolize our partnership.

778
00:51:16.095 --> 00:51:18.280
And it is not
appropriate for this moment.

779
00:51:18.673 --> 00:51:19.588
Oh. no. I was just-

780
00:51:20.167 --> 00:51:23.029
Hoping to jot down some ideas
for what we will put

781
00:51:23.054 --> 00:51:24.945
on our tombstones.
I'll start.

782
00:51:25.123 --> 00:51:26.575
"His partner did it."

783
00:51:27.133 --> 00:51:29.610
What happened to you that you can't
just have a normal conversation?

784
00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.499
I will save that for my therapy animal.

785
00:51:35.068 --> 00:51:38.014
Yeah. you need a therapy animal.

786
00:51:38.204 --> 00:51:42.434
Well. you need a herd of therapy animals.

787
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.704
Yeah. you need a whole
migration of therapy animals!

788
00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:21.404
Carrots?

789
00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:06.667
Hey. Carrots?

790
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.083
Uh. Carrots?

791
00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:57.042
Carrots!

792
00:54:27.021 --> 00:54:29.901
There was a whole reptile neighborhood.

793
00:54:32.642 --> 00:54:33.684
Their home.

794
00:54:36.808 --> 00:54:38.751
The lynxes just erased it.

795
00:54:39.319 --> 00:54:41.240
This is what they do.

796
00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:43.659
We have to go.

797
00:54:43.684 --> 00:54:47.133
They push the animals out with lies
so they can have more.

798
00:54:47.167 --> 00:54:48.333
We gotta go. Carrots.
we gotta go!

799
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.675
That's what the snake's trying to prove!

800
00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.708
- The ZPD is here.
- What?

801
00:54:53.572 --> 00:54:55.648
No one will believe us.
Not without proof!

802
00:54:55.682 --> 00:54:59.387
Leave it! They aren't gonna just arrest us.
the lynxes want us dead!

803
00:54:59.417 --> 00:55:01.039
We need it. to solve the case.

804
00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:03.427
- Judy. just-
- We have to solve the case!

805
00:55:03.544 --> 00:55:06.095
- Nick!
- I don't care about the case!

806
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:10.302
Judy. it's not worth dying for.

807
00:55:13.182 --> 00:55:16.918
The world will never be
a better place if no one is

808
00:55:16.943 --> 00:55:18.874
brave enough to do the right thing.

809
00:55:18.941 --> 00:55:21.072
The world is what it is. Carrots.

810
00:55:21.106 --> 00:55:24.342
And sometimes. being a hero

811
00:55:25.325 --> 00:55:28.427
it just doesn't make a difference.

812
00:55:35.834 --> 00:55:37.222
I think. uh...

813
00:55:39.742 --> 00:55:40.742
I think...

814
00:55:41.716 --> 00:55:43.494
Maybe. maybe we...

815
00:55:46.629 --> 00:55:48.137
are different.

816
00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:26.044
Oh my gosh. I think I just took out a cop.

817
00:56:26.156 --> 00:56:27.774
Uh. sorry sir!

818
00:56:27.852 --> 00:56:28.533
Pawbert?

819
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.174
Yeah. it's. you know...

820
00:56:30.218 --> 00:56:32.852
- We're the good guys!
- I told you she's helping.

821
00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:39.207
Come with us!

822
00:56:41.602 --> 00:56:42.885
We have the fox.

823
00:56:42.995 --> 00:56:44.783
We have the fox!

824
00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:47.305
They already have your partner.

825
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.470
They can't get you too.

826
00:56:50.145 --> 00:56:50.872
Please.

827
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.930
We can stop my family.

828
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.800
Judy.

829
00:57:09.024 --> 00:57:10.024
No. no. no.

830
00:57:12.574 --> 00:57:13.254
I got you.

831
00:57:29.964 --> 00:57:30.964
Here we go.

832
00:57:57.897 --> 00:57:59.370
You're not dead!

833
00:58:00.484 --> 00:58:01.770
She's not dead!

834
00:58:03.299 --> 00:58:04.381
Sorry! Sorry.

835
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.560
I just got my motorcycle license.

836
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.240
Nick?

837
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:14.214
They... They caught him.

838
00:58:17.941 --> 00:58:21.371
But out here. no one's gonna catch us.

839
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.209
Mayor Winddancer.

840
00:58:34.792 --> 00:58:35.840
Where's the bunny?

841
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.440
I don't know.

842
00:58:38.377 --> 00:58:42.328
But you know. she's a rabbit.
so maybe you can pull her out of your hat.

843
00:58:43.364 --> 00:58:44.794
I'm not wearing a hat.

844
00:58:44.828 --> 00:58:46.135
He's messing with you. sir.

845
00:58:46.171 --> 00:58:48.075
I knew that.
Get him out of here.

846
00:58:54.415 --> 00:58:56.640
Where are they. Mr. Wilde?

847
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.468
Begin the expansion.

848
00:59:01.535 --> 00:59:04.381
Freeze Marsh Market. flush everyone out.

849
00:59:04.482 --> 00:59:05.208
No. you ca-

850
00:59:05.233 --> 00:59:10.295
Water folk. like foxes.
are lesser mammals.

851
00:59:10.453 --> 00:59:16.095
If I say they helped a dangerous snake.
no one will care what we do.

852
00:59:17.729 --> 00:59:20.709
You're going to a dark cell. Mr. Wilde.

853
00:59:20.854 --> 00:59:25.920
Just long enough to read the headline
of your partner's demise.

854
00:59:28.299 --> 00:59:31.870
You should have left town
when you had the chance.

855
00:59:40.726 --> 00:59:41.286
Dad.

856
00:59:42.129 --> 00:59:42.649
Fur.

857
00:59:42.855 --> 00:59:45.609
From whoever's helping
the bunny and the snake.

858
00:59:48.214 --> 00:59:49.593
Find Pawbert.

859
00:59:51.828 --> 00:59:54.113
Almost to me hideout.

860
00:59:55.445 --> 00:59:57.870
- Snake in the hole.
- Yeah. yeah.

861
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.406
We shall succeed. Judy Hopps.

862
01:00:02.863 --> 01:00:06.178
We'll stop the Lynxleys
and save your partner.

863
01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.957
I'm sorry.
You are...

864
01:00:09.403 --> 01:00:11.345
Gary.
Gary De'Snake.

865
01:00:11.412 --> 01:00:13.857
- And your last name?
- De'Snake.

866
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.892
Everything is gonna be okay.

867
01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:29.302
Teaming up
with you is very exciting!

868
01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:31.535
Don't worry about my fang.

869
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.015
I got my own anti-venom pen.

870
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.240
Stops the toxin.

871
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.255
<i>Stab me straight into the heart!</i>

872
01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:44.113
Welcome to my oasis.

873
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.227
Away from my evil family.

874
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:52.505
I like to come here. just kinda
veg out. get with all my cat stuff.

875
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.880
No. that's actually vintage.

876
01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:57.000
You could just not...

877
01:00:57.826 --> 01:00:59.146
No. no. please don't.

878
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.535
Wow. mammals get the best stuff!

879
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.841
No! Not that.

880
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.042
Turn it off. turn it off.
turn it off. turn it off.

881
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.033
So we should probably get to the journal.

882
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.655
How did you become partners?

883
01:01:16.468 --> 01:01:19.401
When I found out the journal was gonna
be on display at the gala.

884
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:23.109
I sent his family an anonymous
letter asking to see it.

885
01:01:23.198 --> 01:01:28.031
Luckily. they make Pawbert work
in the mail room. so he read it first.

886
01:01:28.153 --> 01:01:30.631
I got him smuggled in from overseas.

887
01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:32.400
Seven days in a crate.

888
01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:36.160
But if I fix things for my family.
it'll be worth it.

889
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.560
Then we'll fix things
for your partner. too.

890
01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:51.245
Hey. I know coming with us was hard.
but we're gonna help your partner

891
01:01:51.703 --> 01:01:53.991
the same way we're going to help the city.

892
01:01:55.028 --> 01:01:58.845
We stop my family and show
everyone the truth.

893
01:01:59.726 --> 01:02:00.452
Are you ready?

894
01:02:01.479 --> 01:02:03.377
Light the fire.

895
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:15.162
How much do you know?

896
01:02:15.295 --> 01:02:16.128
Well...

897
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.230
That his family was framed.

898
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:22.216
And there's some secret
hidden in the metal cover

899
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.469
that only a snake can see.

900
01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.750
Not just any snake.

901
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:29.833
A heat-sensing pit viper.

902
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.500
All it takes is a little warmth.

903
01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:35.833
I just don-

904
01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:37.458
I don't understand.

905
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:42.395
Why would your great-grandfather
hide a secret for a snake?

906
01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:45.095
<i>He</i> didn't.

907
01:02:45.946 --> 01:02:46.591
I...

908
01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.658
It wasn't his journal.

909
01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.140
That's the secret.

910
01:02:55.881 --> 01:02:59.180
Zootopia wasn't created by a mammal.

911
01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:03.767
It was created by a snake.

912
01:03:03.924 --> 01:03:06.736
Gary's great-grandmother.

913
01:03:08.321 --> 01:03:12.941
She wanted to make the city a place
where all animals felt welcome.

914
01:03:15.475 --> 01:03:20.642
So she invented her weather
walls to help everyone.

915
01:03:25.955 --> 01:03:30.944
She just needed an investor. a partner.

916
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:36.993
But when my great-grandfather saw what her
idea could be worth.

917
01:03:40.704 --> 01:03:44.627
he plotted to steal her plans for himself.

918
01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.298
So he committed a murder.

919
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.640
His own maid.

920
01:04:00.808 --> 01:04:03.243
And framed Gary's great-grandmother.

921
01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:09.984
And because she was a snake.
everyone believed his lie.

922
01:04:11.273 --> 01:04:12.261
Soon.

923
01:04:13.904 --> 01:04:16.223
no reptiles were welcome.

924
01:04:17.226 --> 01:04:18.679
And over time.

925
01:04:19.214 --> 01:04:26.033
my great-grandfather
buried the reptile neighborhood in snow.

926
01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:35.062
And he died. believing no one
could ever uncover his crimes.

927
01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:37.093
But...

928
01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:42.104
He was wrong.

929
01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:45.352
Her original patent

930
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:47.793
was saved.

931
01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.765
That's what you're looking for.

932
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:52.509
She hid it in her home.

933
01:04:53.499 --> 01:04:57.595
Find her home. find her patent.

934
01:05:05.938 --> 01:05:12.796
We just didn't know where her
home was buried until now.

935
01:05:14.102 --> 01:05:15.966
My family's land?

936
01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:21.850
But under all that snow. how
are we going to find it?

937
01:05:22.249 --> 01:05:24.258
Wait.
Clock tower.

938
01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.287
Her neighborhood. the reptile
neighborhood. had a clock tower.

939
01:05:28.388 --> 01:05:30.028
It lights up like a beacon!

940
01:05:30.174 --> 01:05:33.466
If it wasn't fully buried.
maybe we could see it.

941
01:05:33.611 --> 01:05:35.218
Follow it to her home.

942
01:05:35.263 --> 01:05:37.403
Except my great-grandfather
turned off the power.

943
01:05:37.428 --> 01:05:41.100
But we have the plans that show
us how to turn it back on.

944
01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:46.491
The power switch to her
whole neighborhood was in...

945
01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:49.749
- The original control room.
- All right.

946
01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:51.290
And where is that?

947
01:05:51.389 --> 01:05:55.239
Inside the oldest wall of the city.
the Desert-Tundratown weather wall.

948
01:05:55.419 --> 01:06:02.473
We get inside. turn on that switch.
light the clock tower - we find her house.

949
01:06:02.517 --> 01:06:04.055
We find her patent.

950
01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.484
And my family is finally coming home.

951
01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:09.772
We will succeed. Judy Hopps.

952
01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:12.562
We shall succeed!

953
01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:16.507
I found him.

954
01:06:18.363 --> 01:06:19.643
Get me Hoggbottom.

955
01:06:24.158 --> 01:06:26.368
It's Nicholas Wilde.

956
01:06:26.401 --> 01:06:27.783
Big time cop. huh?

957
01:06:27.808 --> 01:06:30.352
I'll see you at the lunch table.

958
01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:33.232
I'm gonna tie your tail in a knot!

959
01:06:33.343 --> 01:06:35.765
- Hoggbottom?
- What are you looking at. butt head?

960
01:06:36.357 --> 01:06:38.028
This is a mistake.
It's a setup.

961
01:06:38.053 --> 01:06:39.314
It's the lynxes!

962
01:06:39.426 --> 01:06:41.011
Listen to me. please.

963
01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:44.168
I know we have had 
our differences. right bud?

964
01:06:44.203 --> 01:06:46.758
I-I've always respected you.

965
01:06:47.584 --> 01:06:50.375
You don't respect anyone.

966
01:06:52.881 --> 01:06:54.906
It's Milton Lynxley.

967
01:06:55.107 --> 01:06:57.160
he's got the rabbit's location.

968
01:06:57.383 --> 01:06:59.627
Whatever he says. it's a lie. Hoggbottom.

969
01:06:59.658 --> 01:07:01.245
Hoggbottom. listen to me!

970
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.917
Nicholas Wilde!

971
01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:13.167
What are the chances!

972
01:07:15.066 --> 01:07:17.025
You know. this is my first time in prison.

973
01:07:17.062 --> 01:07:20.982
And I got to say. their food is on point.

974
01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:23.823
How are you even here?

975
01:07:23.879 --> 01:07:26.691
Destiny! Plus an arrest.

976
01:07:27.428 --> 01:07:29.638
But it looks like Judith got away.

977
01:07:29.705 --> 01:07:33.823
Was that decision mutual?

978
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.707
Oh. sensing in trouble in paradise.

979
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.015
Want to talk about it?

980
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.360
What I want is to get out of here.

981
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.895
Right. your big plan.

982
01:07:42.978 --> 01:07:46.312
Lay low on Outback Island
sipping piña koalas.

983
01:07:46.446 --> 01:07:49.440
Except you can't trust koalas
cause they got four thumbs.

984
01:07:49.537 --> 01:07:51.800
Did a whole episode
about it on the podcast.

985
01:07:51.948 --> 01:07:55.084
It was called "They Got Four Thumbs."
But you know what?

986
01:07:55.151 --> 01:07:56.466
At least they ain't platypuses.

987
01:07:56.491 --> 01:08:00.352
Wait. can you just. can you
please just let me concentrate?

988
01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.400
Roger that.

989
01:08:06.557 --> 01:08:08.544
Just talk to me. dude.

990
01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:12.240
What's the last thing she said to you?

991
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.854
She. um. she said.

992
01:08:16.435 --> 01:08:20.600
"Maybe we are too different."

993
01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:24.671
And what did you say before that?

994
01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:27.606
I said the case isn't worth dying for.

995
01:08:28.455 --> 01:08:30.999
Like...
Like. you know.

996
01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:35.400
as in it isn't worth
her dying for because...

997
01:08:36.814 --> 01:08:41.825
Because solitary animals like
me don't have real friends.

998
01:08:42.768 --> 01:08:43.935
And I...
I...

999
01:08:44.975 --> 01:08:46.475
I don't want to lose her.

1000
01:08:48.006 --> 01:08:49.126
So. I just...

1001
01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:51.920
I don't know how to say that.

1002
01:08:54.805 --> 01:08:55.542
You know what. bud?

1003
01:08:55.989 --> 01:08:57.305
I think you just did.

1004
01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.917
Wait. how'd you do that?

1005
01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:04.359
Well. I open my arms. put them
around you. and then I squeeze.

1006
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:05.710
It's called a hug.

1007
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:07.420
Do foxes not have hugs?

1008
01:09:08.008 --> 01:09:09.962
Oh. the lock.

1009
01:09:10.038 --> 01:09:11.814
Yeah. that's Beave 101.

1010
01:09:12.302 --> 01:09:14.102
The rabbit's in Desert Dunes!

1011
01:09:14.255 --> 01:09:16.163
- Roll out!
- Roll out!

1012
01:09:16.583 --> 01:09:19.683
Your partner needs you.
and Nibbles Maplestick

1013
01:09:19.708 --> 01:09:21.223
is gonna get you to her.

1014
01:09:22.372 --> 01:09:24.640
Hey. it's the fox dad!

1015
01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:27.283
- And the woodchuck!
- Woodchuck?

1016
01:09:27.316 --> 01:09:29.348
I'm a beaver!
Call me that again-

1017
01:09:30.793 --> 01:09:31.578
Okay. go!
We gotta go.

1018
01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:32.168
Here we go.

1019
01:09:36.013 --> 01:09:37.785
Hello. Nicholas.

1020
01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.680
I hope you like my new home.

1021
01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:42.227
I wove it with my own wool.

1022
01:09:42.892 --> 01:09:43.678
Jump scare!

1023
01:09:48.656 --> 01:09:49.392
Adios!

1024
01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.535
Wheels.
We need wheels.

1025
01:10:08.888 --> 01:10:10.153
No. no. no. no!

1026
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:11.805
I'm sorry.

1027
01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:14.584
I do not think we can get to Judy
in time to help.

1028
01:10:14.986 --> 01:10:15.878
Unless...

1029
01:10:16.381 --> 01:10:20.834
You happen to know the fastest
driver in the history of Zootopia?

1030
01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:39.503
Hey. Flash. Flash. 100-yard dash!

1031
01:10:39.537 --> 01:10:42.349
Partner's in trouble. need to
get across town. ignore the laws.

1032
01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.458
No...

1033
01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:47.471
problem.

1034
01:10:47.894 --> 01:10:48.774
Let's hit it.

1035
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.554
Hey. glad you're here.

1036
01:10:53.778 --> 01:10:56.958
I got to tell you. I'm not convinced
a sloth is our most reliable-

1037
01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:05.706
To turn on the clock tower. and light the way

1038
01:11:05.792 --> 01:11:08.755
to your great-grandma's home so we can
find her patent. we need to reach

1039
01:11:08.785 --> 01:11:10.560
the power control room. through here.

1040
01:11:10.775 --> 01:11:12.167
But we have to move quickly
or we're never going to-

1041
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:14.400
We shall succeed. Judy Hopps.

1042
01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.135
Look. Gary. if we don't overprepare.
we're underprepared.

1043
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.840
And I don't...

1044
01:11:18.777 --> 01:11:23.240
My family has been trying to prove we're
not what everyone thinks for 100 years.

1045
01:11:23.655 --> 01:11:26.679
But even this close.
they never want me

1046
01:11:26.704 --> 01:11:29.123
to put the weight of the world 
on my shoulders.

1047
01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:31.713
Because. I don't have any shoulders!

1048
01:11:33.275 --> 01:11:35.147
We shall succeed.

1049
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:41.189
I got you. rabbit.

1050
01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:46.902
I cannot help Judy if I don't know where
she is. which is why I need you

1051
01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:49.433
to get on Paul's computer 
and track Hoggbottom.

1052
01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:50.840
You are an escaped fugitive.

1053
01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.027
I could get fired for even talking to you!

1054
01:11:53.052 --> 01:11:55.686
They're gonna put her to sleep!
Do it!

1055
01:11:55.731 --> 01:11:56.280
Okay!

1056
01:11:58.934 --> 01:12:01.155
Did you try restarting it?
Mm-hmm.

1057
01:12:01.311 --> 01:12:03.710
- Have you tried not being an idiot?
- Hey. Paul.

1058
01:12:03.744 --> 01:12:05.360
I got you some donuts-

1059
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.406
- Oh. no.
- Thanks. Clawhauser.

1060
01:12:08.431 --> 01:12:10.552
Clawhauser!
Location.

1061
01:12:13.987 --> 01:12:15.262
Oh. no.

1062
01:12:15.463 --> 01:12:17.639
I think we're gonna have
to go through the festival.

1063
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:18.756
Festival?

1064
01:12:24.366 --> 01:12:25.913
The phone's the first thing they track!

1065
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.739
Go. go!

1066
01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:33.292
- Clawhauser!
- I am working on it!

1067
01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:35.706
- Got it!
- Great! Great. great.

1068
01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:36.708
- Now...
- No!

1069
01:12:47.527 --> 01:12:49.125
What festival is this?

1070
01:13:02.417 --> 01:13:04.391
- Come on!
- Go. go. go!

1071
01:13:05.184 --> 01:13:07.363
We are with you. Judy Hopps.

1072
01:13:09.741 --> 01:13:11.791
We meet again. zebra.

1073
01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.597
Here come the horns!

1074
01:13:18.677 --> 01:13:19.815
She's going for the door.

1075
01:13:19.849 --> 01:13:21.456
She's going for the door!

1076
01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:23.956
Clawhauser. we're out of time!

1077
01:13:24.559 --> 01:13:25.417
I got it!

1078
01:13:26.144 --> 01:13:27.792
Desert-Tundratown weather wall.
access door.

1079
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.474
Desert-Tundratown weather wall
access door. hurry!

1080
01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:32.815
What is in that wall?

1081
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.855
A power control room.

1082
01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.802
But for... like some
old part of Tundratown.

1083
01:13:37.271 --> 01:13:38.889
I know what they're doing.

1084
01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:40.181
They'll ruin us!

1085
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.972
No more tranquilizers!

1086
01:13:45.059 --> 01:13:46.745
- Put them down.
- Sir?

1087
01:13:46.824 --> 01:13:49.168
Put them down now!

1088
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:53.781
Take the shot.

1089
01:13:54.325 --> 01:13:55.805
Take the shot!

1090
01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.014
Do it!

1091
01:14:24.676 --> 01:14:25.306
Judy!

1092
01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:32.968
Power control room?

1093
01:14:33.012 --> 01:14:35.541
Uh. five flights up.
Come on. hurry!

1094
01:14:36.033 --> 01:14:38.755
There is a lot of stairs.

1095
01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:42.292
Way to hustle. bud.
I love you. I owe you!

1096
01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:46.769
It's turning on.
It's turning on!

1097
01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:50.486
Nibbles?

1098
01:14:55.507 --> 01:14:56.199
Nibbles!

1099
01:14:58.323 --> 01:14:59.239
Snake!

1100
01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:01.667
Cold!

1101
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.780
- It's jammed.
- Don't worry about me.

1102
01:15:05.884 --> 01:15:07.164
Find the switch.

1103
01:15:08.222 --> 01:15:09.514
No. no. no. no. not these.

1104
01:15:09.584 --> 01:15:11.167
It would be...

1105
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:12.300
Older.

1106
01:15:29.086 --> 01:15:30.086
Can you see it?

1107
01:15:31.043 --> 01:15:32.728
Did we turn on the clock tower?

1108
01:15:36.348 --> 01:15:37.056
There.

1109
01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:40.167
It's there.

1110
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.167
We did it.

1111
01:15:45.888 --> 01:15:47.638
We can find the original patent.

1112
01:15:49.592 --> 01:15:50.259
Nick?

1113
01:15:51.664 --> 01:15:52.289
The door.

1114
01:15:52.611 --> 01:15:53.611
It's locked. Wait...

1115
01:15:53.993 --> 01:15:54.993
How did it lock?

1116
01:15:55.103 --> 01:15:56.103
Nibbles?

1117
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:59.850
Nibbles!

1118
01:16:02.131 --> 01:16:03.621
Dang door stuck on me.

1119
01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:05.675
Sorry.

1120
01:16:06.319 --> 01:16:08.903
Last case there was kind of a twist.

1121
01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:10.373
I know.

1122
01:16:14.564 --> 01:16:16.356
Oh my gosh. I really...

1123
01:16:16.389 --> 01:16:17.750
Oh. my heart is pounding.

1124
01:16:17.855 --> 01:16:19.882
Oh. I thought you knew.

1125
01:16:20.025 --> 01:16:21.234
I thought you knew.

1126
01:16:22.658 --> 01:16:23.908
Sorry. partner.

1127
01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:27.542
Hate to leave you out in the cold.

1128
01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.875
But. I'm gonna...

1129
01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:33.532
Please don't be mad at me.

1130
01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:36.568
But. I mean. you get it.

1131
01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:39.313
We've always been on the same page.

1132
01:16:39.631 --> 01:16:40.798
Me and you.

1133
01:16:40.845 --> 01:16:42.728
Underdogs. right?

1134
01:16:43.162 --> 01:16:46.039
You gotta prove you're
as good as everyone else.

1135
01:16:46.122 --> 01:16:47.455
That you belong.

1136
01:16:48.964 --> 01:16:51.006
I know it's messed up.

1137
01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.588
But. this is my chance.

1138
01:16:54.017 --> 01:16:55.308
I have to take it.

1139
01:16:56.019 --> 01:16:58.443
Cause when I get to his
great-grandma's home

1140
01:16:58.598 --> 01:17:01.515
and I burn the original patent.

1141
01:17:02.167 --> 01:17:04.500
I'll finally be something in my family.

1142
01:17:05.539 --> 01:17:07.940
And I'll finally belong. too.

1143
01:17:08.115 --> 01:17:08.755
Judy!

1144
01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:13.688
Carrots?

1145
01:17:18.244 --> 01:17:19.452
No loose ends.

1146
01:17:22.316 --> 01:17:23.149
Bye. partner.

1147
01:17:27.005 --> 01:17:28.005
Bye. Judy Hopps.

1148
01:17:31.925 --> 01:17:34.280
Pawbert. Please.

1149
01:17:35.129 --> 01:17:38.379
You can be different than your family.

1150
01:17:40.301 --> 01:17:41.676
I don't want to be different.

1151
01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:46.953
Nick.

1152
01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:50.419
Judy?

1153
01:17:58.939 --> 01:17:59.689
Judy?

1154
01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:02.319
Nibbles. do you see her?

1155
01:18:02.358 --> 01:18:04.191
No. nothing yet.

1156
01:18:05.786 --> 01:18:06.411
Judy!

1157
01:18:06.703 --> 01:18:07.578
Ni...

1158
01:18:09.225 --> 01:18:10.100
Ni...

1159
01:18:14.194 --> 01:18:18.194
We shall... succeed. Judy Hopps.

1160
01:18:24.127 --> 01:18:24.994
It's okay.

1161
01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:26.283
Judy sent me.

1162
01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:28.554
She needs to find Nick.

1163
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.875
Yep. Should have seen that coming.

1164
01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:37.833
Judy?

1165
01:18:40.775 --> 01:18:41.567
Nick...

1166
01:18:42.772 --> 01:18:43.397
We...

1167
01:18:45.078 --> 01:18:45.995
shall...

1168
01:18:47.071 --> 01:18:48.398
succeed.

1169
01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:52.131
Judy.

1170
01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:57.208
I can't... move.

1171
01:18:58.458 --> 01:19:03.542
And you're too cold... to... help.

1172
01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:05.042
And he's gonna...

1173
01:19:06.739 --> 01:19:08.431
Nick's gonna...

1174
01:19:08.556 --> 01:19:09.348
Judy.

1175
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:11.250
The world...

1176
01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:12.750
was never...

1177
01:19:12.917 --> 01:19:13.917
meant...

1178
01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:14.917
to be...

1179
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.083
on one animal's... shoulders...

1180
01:19:21.222 --> 01:19:24.583
That's why my great-grandma...

1181
01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:27.167
wanted... Zootopia...

1182
01:19:27.617 --> 01:19:29.375
to be... for...

1183
01:19:29.525 --> 01:19:30.575
everyone.

1184
01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:32.958
So. we could...

1185
01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:36.167
all... help each other.

1186
01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:40.083
I... didn't... help.

1187
01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.667
You did.

1188
01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:47.000
You chose... to help...

1189
01:19:47.441 --> 01:19:48.441
me.

1190
01:19:50.147 --> 01:19:51.147
And became...

1191
01:19:51.639 --> 01:19:52.639
my best...

1192
01:19:53.366 --> 01:19:56.200
warm-blooded friend.

1193
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.445
Very warm.

1194
01:20:12.939 --> 01:20:15.314
Permission to hug?

1195
01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:33.725
We're gonna save you.

1196
01:20:34.111 --> 01:20:35.903
And save your friend.

1197
01:20:37.319 --> 01:20:38.069
Judy!

1198
01:20:39.053 --> 01:20:40.803
Hey! He's gonna eat that rabbit!

1199
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:41.542
No. I... Wait!

1200
01:20:41.568 --> 01:20:42.500
I-I'm saving her!

1201
01:20:42.539 --> 01:20:44.000
I'm gonna get her the anti-pen!

1202
01:20:44.083 --> 01:20:45.000
Where is she?

1203
01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:46.746
She...

1204
01:20:47.474 --> 01:20:48.557
She didn't make it.

1205
01:20:49.572 --> 01:20:52.863
But with snake bites 
you go fast.

1206
01:20:54.042 --> 01:20:54.792
You'll see.

1207
01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:06.542
No!

1208
01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.201
She's gone. Nick!

1209
01:21:13.252 --> 01:21:15.211
Just. get it over with!

1210
01:21:28.502 --> 01:21:29.836
You're done.

1211
01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.386
Know when to quit!

1212
01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:34.458

1213
01:21:34.877 --> 01:21:36.794
We can save her with the anti-venom!

1214
01:21:36.877 --> 01:21:38.169
Throw me the bag!

1215
01:21:39.397 --> 01:21:40.139
Judy!

1216
01:21:58.339 --> 01:21:58.922
Leave it!

1217
01:21:59.005 --> 01:22:00.608
You're gonna kill us both.

1218
01:22:01.064 --> 01:22:03.443
It's not worth dying for.

1219
01:22:04.843 --> 01:22:07.363
Agree to disagree.

1220
01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:20.570
<i>Stab me straight into the heart!</i>

1221
01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:53.917
- I was trying to get to you...
- I thought that you...

1222
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.833
He told me that you...

1223
01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:56.083
- I saw you...
- That you were...

1224
01:22:59.086 --> 01:23:01.601
I'll... help your friend.

1225
01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:08.387
Okay. I don't care that we're different.
You know? I...

1226
01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:12.268
What I care about is you.

1227
01:23:12.293 --> 01:23:13.733
I care about you.

1228
01:23:15.818 --> 01:23:16.258
Okay?

1229
01:23:18.575 --> 01:23:20.027
And I didn't say it.

1230
01:23:20.608 --> 01:23:25.351
I should have said it.
but I didn't because...

1231
01:23:27.617 --> 01:23:31.398
Well. because I am an emotionally insecure

1232
01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.112
source of your discomfort

1233
01:23:34.213 --> 01:23:36.880
who is not good at
expressing his feelings.

1234
01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:41.096
Probably because I've been
on my own my whole life.

1235
01:23:41.121 --> 01:23:42.176
It's not an excuse.

1236
01:23:42.215 --> 01:23:45.735
It's just... It's why
instead of telling you that you're

1237
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.601
the best thing that ever happened to me.
I make jokes about your ears.

1238
01:23:51.668 --> 01:23:57.460
and I tell you that you try too hard when.
you know. the truth is I just don't want you

1239
01:23:57.773 --> 01:24:03.253
to get hurt. because...
Because no one else in the world

1240
01:24:03.498 --> 01:24:06.702
matters more to me than you do.

1241
01:24:08.978 --> 01:24:11.657
I... I do try too hard 
because deep down I'm afraid

1242
01:24:11.682 --> 01:24:12.935
that I am what everyone thinks I am.

1243
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.563
And I suppress my discomfort because I'm
worried it makes me look weak

1244
01:24:15.588 --> 01:24:17.655
and I want to be strong. 
and I think I'm failing all the time.

1245
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.760
And I only take what you say personally
because you're the only one in my life

1246
01:24:20.796 --> 01:24:24.313
who ever believed in me.
even when I don't even believe in myself.

1247
01:24:24.503 --> 01:24:25.909
And I should have told you that.

1248
01:24:26.859 --> 01:24:29.208
No one else in the world matters to me

1249
01:24:29.261 --> 01:24:31.031
more than you do either.

1250
01:24:32.907 --> 01:24:35.295
I have unresolved childhood trauma
that I refuse to discuss

1251
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.889
because being vulnerable scares me.

1252
01:24:36.914 --> 01:24:39.389
I make dangerous choices because I
have an unhealthy Bunny Hero complex.

1253
01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:42.324
And I didn't join the ZPD
because I wanted to be a cop.

1254
01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:45.329
I joined because I always
wanted to be part of a pack.

1255
01:24:45.719 --> 01:24:48.130
And the thought of losing
you scares me because...

1256
01:24:49.612 --> 01:24:50.753
Because you're my pack.

1257
01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:53.406
I should never have left you.

1258
01:24:53.431 --> 01:24:55.739
And I do need a herd of therapy animals.

1259
01:24:55.764 --> 01:24:57.416
And I should have told you that you are

1260
01:24:57.441 --> 01:24:59.983
the only partner I would 
ever want because...

1261
01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:02.250
You're my fluffle.

1262
01:25:04.167 --> 01:25:05.958
That's a bunch of rabbits.

1263
01:25:08.253 --> 01:25:11.568
Now that is what we call an overshare.

1264
01:25:11.735 --> 01:25:14.168
I'm alive. by the way.
I made it.

1265
01:25:14.592 --> 01:25:16.835
Oh. also. that guy's still alive.

1266
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.188
He's gonna get to the lost
reptile neighborhood

1267
01:25:24.213 --> 01:25:26.535
find great-grandma's patent. and destroy it.

1268
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.195
Yeah. I've got no idea what that means
or who Gary is. but let's go!

1269
01:25:30.813 --> 01:25:32.069
Hopps and Wilde?

1270
01:25:32.094 --> 01:25:33.254
Wilde and Hopps!

1271
01:25:33.311 --> 01:25:35.083
And Nibbles and Gary!

1272
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:36.333
He's Gary.

1273
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:40.482
Thank you. For the snake.
He's cold.

1274
01:25:40.507 --> 01:25:42.346
- No fur on him.
- Where are you going?

1275
01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:43.208
Bye now!

1276
01:25:46.309 --> 01:25:47.302
- You!
- Wow. dad!

1277
01:25:47.327 --> 01:25:49.623
You don't belong in this family.

1278
01:25:49.648 --> 01:25:52.458
- You will never belong in this family.
- Wait. wait. wait.

1279
01:25:52.494 --> 01:25:53.736
I wasn't working with them.

1280
01:25:53.772 --> 01:25:55.267
I was helping us.

1281
01:25:57.181 --> 01:26:01.378
I know where the reptile neighborhood is
buried. where to find the real patent

1282
01:26:01.403 --> 01:26:04.280
that proves that snakes invented the walls.

1283
01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:08.898
I'm going to destroy it for the family.

1284
01:26:08.934 --> 01:26:11.188
For you. daddy.

1285
01:26:13.811 --> 01:26:15.594
You want to keep your job.

1286
01:26:15.619 --> 01:26:17.025
You say nothing.

1287
01:26:17.784 --> 01:26:18.577
You!

1288
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.378
Maybe you are a Lynxley.

1289
01:26:21.565 --> 01:26:22.845
Take me to the patent.

1290
01:26:25.664 --> 01:26:30.541
Takes a threesome to be some.
but a four-way to bust your doorway!

1291
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.975
Get to the patent!

1292
01:26:36.012 --> 01:26:37.092
Destroy it!

1293
01:26:39.056 --> 01:26:40.628
Go. we got this!

1294
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.160
Hi. Whiskers.
You're done

1295
01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.760
hurting my city.

1296
01:26:45.987 --> 01:26:47.530
Uh-oh. tides have turned.

1297
01:26:48.813 --> 01:26:50.548
Hey. Brian Winddancer.

1298
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.592
You want to be a hero
or just play one on TV?

1299
01:27:19.793 --> 01:27:21.751
I go left. and you go right?

1300
01:27:21.776 --> 01:27:23.543
Uh. yeah.

1301
01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:26.724
Or...

1302
01:27:40.742 --> 01:27:42.655
You are a horrible driver!

1303
01:27:42.856 --> 01:27:43.981
Yes. I am!

1304
01:27:58.833 --> 01:27:59.838
I'm gonna jump!

1305
01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.280
Zoogetherness!

1306
01:28:07.553 --> 01:28:09.219
No. never mind. Forget I said it.
Here we go.

1307
01:28:12.381 --> 01:28:14.131
Matches. matches.
matches. matches!

1308
01:28:15.969 --> 01:28:18.219
Bunnies. we're burrowers.
Rabbit kick!

1309
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:24.190
I'll destroy the patent.

1310
01:28:24.292 --> 01:28:26.572
that town and everything in it.

1311
01:28:26.612 --> 01:28:32.304
And a dirt bag fox and a dumb
bunny will never stand in my way.

1312
01:28:32.338 --> 01:28:35.273
She's not a dumb bunny.
and you're forgetting one thing.

1313
01:28:35.307 --> 01:28:36.682
What's that?

1314
01:28:36.707 --> 01:28:38.267
We're friends with a snake.

1315
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:40.042
Handy. partner.

1316
01:28:41.622 --> 01:28:42.271
Heads up.

1317
01:28:45.417 --> 01:28:47.885
- Daddy!
- Daddy is busy!

1318
01:28:48.095 --> 01:28:49.678
Brian? Go!

1319
01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:52.226
You say justice is dead.

1320
01:28:52.484 --> 01:28:54.916
I say. neigh!

1321
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.152
Here. kitty. kitty!

1322
01:29:04.392 --> 01:29:07.187
- It's called an arrest. sweetheart.
- And boom.

1323
01:29:13.834 --> 01:29:16.407
No one will believe you over us.

1324
01:29:17.181 --> 01:29:21.769
We've always been better than you.
and we always will be.

1325
01:29:22.427 --> 01:29:25.998
Nothing you do matters.

1326
01:29:27.327 --> 01:29:30.072
Well. it matters to him.

1327
01:29:31.736 --> 01:29:32.617
Shall we?

1328
01:30:41.283 --> 01:30:42.492
One long sock.

1329
01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:32.806
I'm gonna burn it all to the ground!

1330
01:32:32.862 --> 01:32:35.574
I'm a real Lynxley!

1331
01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:46.865
That'll do. pig.
That'll do.

1332
01:32:48.833 --> 01:32:50.335
Astonishing news today.

1333
01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:55.175
After officers Judy Hopps
and Nicholas Wilde. along with a pit viper

1334
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.295
and a beaver.
foiled another major conspiracy

1335
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.095
by revealing the true inventor
of the city's weather walls was a snake.

1336
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:07.034
While the now disgraced Lynxley family
were revealed to have stolen

1337
01:33:07.059 --> 01:33:09.735
the original plans and covered it up for decades.

1338
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.760
You have not heard the last of Milton-

1339
01:33:13.853 --> 01:33:17.853
Their Tundratown expansion
now officially canceled.

1340
01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.955
Some are calling you the dream team.

1341
01:33:21.199 --> 01:33:22.903
How did you do it?

1342
01:33:24.469 --> 01:33:28.231
Well. there's a lot of
different animals out there

1343
01:33:28.532 --> 01:33:32.818
and sometimes we start to look
at all the little reasons

1344
01:33:32.843 --> 01:33:37.695
that we're not the same. 
and it makes us worry.

1345
01:33:38.934 --> 01:33:45.329
But maybe if we just talk to each other.
if we just try to understand one another.

1346
01:33:45.507 --> 01:33:50.931
we would see that our differences don't
really make any difference at all.

1347
01:33:51.289 --> 01:33:56.690
Maybe we'd even see that 
what makes me. me. and you. you.

1348
01:33:57.315 --> 01:34:00.820
can make us even stronger.

1349
01:34:01.547 --> 01:34:05.667
And with hard work. you're going
to get to that by year two.

1350
01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.400
Yeah.

1351
01:34:07.411 --> 01:34:08.286
Zebros.

1352
01:34:09.408 --> 01:34:10.960
Actually. my name is Gene.

1353
01:34:11.863 --> 01:34:15.496
My name is also Gene.

1354
01:34:15.884 --> 01:34:16.934
Zebros!

1355
01:34:24.481 --> 01:34:25.970
He did it!

1356
01:34:28.181 --> 01:34:29.701
Kids. get off the snake.

1357
01:34:34.246 --> 01:34:35.686
How's everybody doing?

1358
01:34:36.891 --> 01:34:37.751
One second.

1359
01:34:48.917 --> 01:34:51.542
This is my family.

1360
01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.476
Permission to hug?

1361
01:34:58.525 --> 01:34:59.693
Thank you.

1362
01:35:03.984 --> 01:35:04.983
Hey. uh...

1363
01:35:05.714 --> 01:35:06.835
I got you something.

1364
01:35:15.578 --> 01:35:16.623
Love you. partner.

1365
01:35:17.097 --> 01:35:20.388
But I am still me. so I'm only
saying it once a decade.

1366
01:35:21.176 --> 01:35:22.293
<i>Love you. partner.</i>

1367
01:35:23.069 --> 01:35:24.194
Well. I'm gonna need that back.

1368
01:35:24.238 --> 01:35:25.340
I'll give it back to you

1369
01:35:25.561 --> 01:35:26.995
after our next case.

1370
01:35:27.256 --> 01:35:28.672
There's gonna be another case. huh?

1371
01:35:28.883 --> 01:35:29.883
Of course.

1372
01:35:30.150 --> 01:35:31.188
Because when you broke out of jail.

1373
01:35:31.213 --> 01:35:33.688
you also released 
200 highly dangerous prisoners.

1374
01:35:33.737 --> 01:35:34.659
Worth it.

1375
01:35:35.266 --> 01:35:37.059
Any idea where you want to start?

1376
01:35:45.396 --> 01:35:49.335
One-way ticket to Outback Island. please.
First class.

1377
01:35:49.648 --> 01:35:51.010
Very nice.

1378
01:35:51.289 --> 01:35:53.811
And remember. if you're happy 
with our service.

1379
01:35:53.836 --> 01:35:57.193
please be sure to leave us four thumbs up.

1380
01:35:57.382 --> 01:35:59.235
Oh. I will.

1381
01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:07.438
