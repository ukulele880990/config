2
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.417
Stop right there!

3
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.833
Stop!

4
00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:12.917
Stop!

5
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:17.916
Stop!

6
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:20.125
Stop!

7
00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:21.333
Stop!

8
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.958
Huajun. Hun soldiers!

9
00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:41.833
Miss. stand behind me.

10
00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.292
Stop resisting and come back with us.

11
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.208
Zhao Zhan.

12
00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.250
what is going on?

13
00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.333
Let's survive this first.

14
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:11.958
Look out!

15
00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:22.542
Watch out!

16
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.208
It's over now.

17
00:05:57.458 --> 00:05:59.292
Miss. what was this about?

18
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.250
I've run out of arrows.

19
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.333
What should we do?

20
00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:29.958
Get her.

21
00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:36.542
Stop chasing!

22
00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.667
Zhao Zhan. the Hun soldiers
will be here soon.

23
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.542
Miss. please have it back.

24
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:02.833
You had better leave.

25
00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:04.750
What about you?

26
00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.000
No need to worry about us.

27
00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:07.792
Take my horse.

28
00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:09.333
He runs fast.

29
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:10.375
His name is Lei Zhen.

30
00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:20.583
Be careful.

31
00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:22.542
Take care.

32
00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:38.833
Why are you holding a dandelion?

33
00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:14.750
Warrior. thank you for rescuing me.

34
00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:16.417
I. Mengyun. am grateful.

35
00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:38.792
Do you like dandelions?

36
00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:47.875
Beautiful.

37
00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:49.750
For you.

38
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.000
Professor!

39
00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:01.042
Check it out.

40
00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:04.292
The genetic report of the warhorse is out.

41
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:05.542
It is a warmblood horse.

42
00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:08.583
No wonder the size of the horse is so big.

43
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:11.542
Wang Jing. what have you got?

44
00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:12.500
Professor.

45
00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:15.208
part of the warhorse has been excavated.

46
00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:18.167
The bridle nose piece
was made from precious metal.

47
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.583
The saddle was padded.

48
00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:20.875
My assumption is that

49
00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.250
it was a cavalry general's mount
in the Western Han dynasty.

50
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:24.250
Strange.

51
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.500
The totem and relief carving
of the mask on this jade pendant

52
00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:29.583
were common in Hunnic culture.

53
00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.500
How did such a precious
Hunnic jade pendant

54
00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:33.458
end up on a horse of the Han people?

55
00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:38.333
Could it be from war spoils?

56
00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:39.292
It's possible.

57
00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:42.000
Either this jade pendant was seized
by the Han army

58
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.417
or this warhorse was seized by Huns.

59
00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:46.208
How about...

60
00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:47.417
How similar.

61
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.333
Similar to what?

62
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:49.792
In my dream just now.

63
00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:51.750
I saw a very handsome guy.

64
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:54.167
but you are not manly like him.

65
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.458
I also dreamed of a very beautiful woman.

66
00:11:58.542 --> 00:11:59.875
That had to be me.

67
00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:01.917
Don't fool yourself.

68
00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:05.333
Didn't you have a gift for him?

69
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:06.250
Go get it.

70
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:07.708
Hurry up. We don't have time.

71
00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:08.958
Go.

72
00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:09.875
Hey.

73
00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.208
- Yes. Professor?
- Keep working on the remains of the horse.

74
00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:13.667
- All right.
- I'm taking this back to the office.

75
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.917
No problem. Professor.

76
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.833
One more thing.

77
00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:16.750
Yes. Professor?

78
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.417
In order to buy this gift for you.

79
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.042
Xinran spent eight hours
traveling back and forth to town.

80
00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:26.917
You wasted so many work hours.

81
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.792
Just give it to me.

82
00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:33.000
I'll pay you back.

83
00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:38.333
If you hadn't overworked yourself so much.
would I bother to get this for you?

84
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.833
Xinran. I have something for you too.

85
00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:45.042
What is it?

86
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.667
Take it.

87
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.875
Professor.
lunch is on the table in the lab.

88
00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:49.875
Don't forget to eat it!

89
00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:50.875
I know.

90
00:12:58.333 --> 00:12:59.583
What did he give you?

91
00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.167
What else other than the lab test list?

92
00:13:03.292 --> 00:13:05.167
Unrequited love is hard.

93
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.542
He really doesn't care about me. does he?

94
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.708
- It's easy for women to chase men.
- Is it?

95
00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:12.167
Look at you.
You wear the same outfit every day.

96
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.250
Why don't you dress up?

97
00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:15.833
Why should I dress up
for an excavation site?

98
00:13:15.917 --> 00:13:18.458
Besides. I don't think he is that shallow.

99
00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.458
By the way.
don't buy facial masks for me anymore.

100
00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:22.333
It feels so sticky on my face.

101
00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:23.292
It's unbearable.

102
00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:25.583
Hydration is good for the skin.

103
00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:27.958
Also. Wang Jing's friend
invited us to dinner tonight.

104
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.500
This jade pendant

105
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:57.583
is a symbol of the sanctuary.

106
00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:01.042
The greatest value of the sanctuary

107
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.167
is not the treasure in it.

108
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:07.833
Rather. it guards

109
00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:11.042
the world's purest and most virtuous land

110
00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:16.208
that holds the blessings
of our ancestors and gods.

111
00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:20.083
This will keep you safe.

112
00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:35.458
Thank you. Great Shaman.

113
00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.167
I hope

114
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.375
you will become my successor.

115
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.750
These are for the benediction
of Father's wellness.

116
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:23.083
Great Shaman.
please bring them back to the sanctuary.

117
00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:25.292
Consider it done. Crown Prince.

118
00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:45.292
Move on!

119
00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:48.083
Move!

120
00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:49.167
Quickly!

121
00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:50.625
Move!

122
00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:51.542
Go!

123
00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:52.458
Move faster!

124
00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:54.792
Stand up!

125
00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:56.958
One by one!

126
00:15:58.208 --> 00:15:59.125
Father.

127
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.125
Huduna.

128
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.750
I raided the Han people

129
00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:05.333
and took their gold and silk.

130
00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:07.458
I slaughtered everyone in the city.

131
00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:10.542
I also beheaded
the general guarding the fort.

132
00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:12.625
I brought it back
as a gift for you. Father.

133
00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:15.583
You've rendered
outstanding service this time.

134
00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:20.125
How should I reward you?

135
00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:21.958
Father.

136
00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:23.500
I want but one thing.

137
00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:26.583
I only ask you to allow Mengyun

138
00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:27.792
to become my wife.

139
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.167
Mengyun?

140
00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:34.500
Father.

141
00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:36.583
Father.

142
00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.125
Mengyun?

143
00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:41.917
I have already granted her

144
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.083
to your brother.

145
00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:48.042
What about

146
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:51.875
all the Han women you brought back?

147
00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.500
I grant them all to you.

148
00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:55.625
What do you think?

149
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.875
Yes.

150
00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.667
I will do what you say.

151
00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:05.250
Good.

152
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.458
Good.

153
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:09.416
You are not well.

154
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.375
You should get some rest now.

155
00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:13.500
Now I will excuse myself.

156
00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:15.041
You get some rest.

157
00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:24.666
Huduna.

158
00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:32.083
You always massacre the people you subdue.

159
00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:33.708
It is too ruthless.

160
00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:36.750
I'm afraid the Han people will retaliate.

161
00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:38.375
It will bring disaster to our people.

162
00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:42.625
Thank you for your guidance. Crown Prince.

163
00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:53.208
Mother.

164
00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:54.833
wait for me at the agreed place.

165
00:17:54.917 --> 00:17:56.417
I will come and join you.

166
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.042
Let's leave together now.

167
00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:00.083
I must avenge my father.

168
00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:01.250
Let me do it.

169
00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:03.500
Go now.

170
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:10.875
Be careful.

171
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.000
My daughter.

172
00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.917
You killed my father.

173
00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:02.333
I feel deep remorse

174
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.333
for what happened in the past.

175
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.792
But what I did afterward

176
00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:17.917
was out of love for you and your mother.

177
00:19:26.292 --> 00:19:27.583
My time

178
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.792
is running out.

179
00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:32.792
Go ahead and do it.

180
00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:52.000
Leave now. I can still intercede for you.

181
00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:54.250
Think of your mother.

182
00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:01.125
Is anyone out there?

183
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.625
Father.

184
00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:16.042
please forgive me.

185
00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:18.958
Huduna.

186
00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.125
Father!

187
00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:22.458
What's wrong with Father?

188
00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:27.750
Huduna.

189
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.083
This is your chosen crown prince.

190
00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:32.375
Let him go.

191
00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:35.167
For you.

192
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.792
I fought battles and risked my life.

193
00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:39.417
But he...

194
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.542
bit the dust just like that.

195
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:47.083
You monster.

196
00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:49.625
My son!

197
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.750
Some time ago. the Great Shaman

198
00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:53.292
made a prophecy of divination

199
00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:56.292
and said I could never become king.

200
00:20:57.667 --> 00:20:58.667
But Father.

201
00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:02.083
how come you would
rather believe in a prophecy

202
00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:03.875
than believe in me?

203
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.417
I'm sorry. Father.

204
00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:13.792
I am not a good son.

205
00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:17.667
Yet

206
00:21:18.542 --> 00:21:19.750
I'm doing this...

207
00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:23.583
for our tribes!

208
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.667
Assassin!

209
00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:46.708
Bring Mengyun back!

210
00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:56.958
Professor.

211
00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:59.500
This is my friend. Lei Zhen.
He organized tonight's party.

212
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:01.417
- Thank you.
- Hello. It's the least I can do.

213
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.083
Your huge discovery
is definitely worth celebrating.

214
00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.167
My company has developed a new game called

215
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.792
The Legend of the Han and the Huns.

216
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:08.708
That's interesting.

217
00:22:08.792 --> 00:22:11.833
When I was in Beijing. I attended your
lecture on wars between the Han and Huns.

218
00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:13.750
It inspired me to develop the game.

219
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.583
You are my mentor.

220
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.375
- Professor Fang.
- Director Wang. how are you?

221
00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:18.542
Hello.

222
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:19.833
Please let me introduce

223
00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:22.500
the boy who discovered the jade pendant.

224
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:23.542
the young Baitula.

225
00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:25.167
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hello. Professor.

226
00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:27.458
Because of you.

227
00:22:27.542 --> 00:22:29.958
we discovered the horse of an officer

228
00:22:30.042 --> 00:22:31.917
under Huo Qubing.
a Western Han dynasty general.

229
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.583
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

230
00:22:34.542 --> 00:22:37.292
He and his family
handed the jade pendant over

231
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:38.625
to the government.

232
00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:39.958
It's a truly commendable act.

233
00:22:40.042 --> 00:22:41.583
I give you many thumbs up.

234
00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:42.708
By the way. Professor.

235
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.500
your application
to continue your research on this artifact

236
00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:46.583
has already been approved.

237
00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:48.417
- Please sign here.
- Thank you.

238
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.125
Also. we will put part of the artifact

239
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:55.042
at the museum for public exhibition.

240
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.792
Professor. please attend then.

241
00:22:57.875 --> 00:22:59.333
Yes. for sure.

242
00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:03.500
Professor. I really want
to join your team to learn more.

243
00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:06.375
I also want to hire you
to be a history advisor for our game.

244
00:23:08.542 --> 00:23:09.375
Well...

245
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.167
I specially arranged this
for everyone to enjoy.

246
00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:45.500
Xinran?

247
00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:57.500
Miss. your dancing with the sword

248
00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:59.083
was really breathtaking.

249
00:25:59.167 --> 00:26:00.125
I wonder if my bow

250
00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:01.750
can be wielded the same way.

251
00:26:05.417 --> 00:26:06.292
Probably not.

252
00:26:09.667 --> 00:26:10.875
Why are you here?

253
00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:13.667
My mother and I planned to meet here.

254
00:26:14.292 --> 00:26:15.625
but she hasn't shown up yet.

255
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Please excuse me.

256
00:26:33.583 --> 00:26:34.542
Greetings. Great Shaman.

257
00:26:35.583 --> 00:26:36.542
Rise.

258
00:26:38.792 --> 00:26:42.625
Huduna captured your mother

259
00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:47.000
for leverage to make you marry him.

260
00:26:47.708 --> 00:26:49.833
The last thing your mother wants

261
00:26:49.917 --> 00:26:52.125
is for you to repeat her tragedy.

262
00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:54.875
She is my mother.

263
00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:56.458
I must go back and save her.

264
00:26:59.167 --> 00:27:01.917
It seems that I chose the right successor.

265
00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:24.958
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

266
00:27:25.042 --> 00:27:26.125
Warriors.

267
00:27:26.667 --> 00:27:28.042
I still have matters to attend to.

268
00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:29.542
I will bid farewell now.

269
00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:32.375
I will always remember your kindness.

270
00:28:04.917 --> 00:28:06.083
You can sleep anywhere.

271
00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:07.667
Everyone has left.

272
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:11.500
Professor. I just had a dream.

273
00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:13.958
I dreamed of a young man
who looked a lot like you.

274
00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:16.875
I also dreamed of a very beautiful woman.

275
00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:19.958
The beauty in real life
was so mad at you that she left.

276
00:28:20.042 --> 00:28:21.750
Forget about that beauty in your dream.

277
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.000
She dressed up and danced for you.

278
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:25.208
but you fell asleep.

279
00:28:25.292 --> 00:28:26.625
Go see her now.

280
00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:29.125
Okay. I'll go now.

281
00:28:32.042 --> 00:28:33.542
Your coat. It's cold up there.

282
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:35.208
Okay. thank you. Professor.

283
00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:44.042
Xinran.

284
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.333
here you are.

285
00:28:45.417 --> 00:28:46.500
You're finally awake.

286
00:28:49.792 --> 00:28:50.958
It's so cold up here.

287
00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:54.000
Xinran. I didn't realize
you could dance so well.

288
00:28:57.292 --> 00:28:58.333
Well.

289
00:28:59.083 --> 00:28:59.917
did you watch it?

290
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.208
I watched it.

291
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.958
Then why were you snoring so loudly?

292
00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:10.625
Xinran.

293
00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.750
when you dress up in a skirt
and remove your glasses.

294
00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:13.792
you look really good.

295
00:29:16.792 --> 00:29:17.833
You are so shallow.

296
00:29:19.708 --> 00:29:22.000
Did you use the facial masks I bought you?

297
00:29:23.167 --> 00:29:24.125
Were those facial masks?

298
00:29:25.625 --> 00:29:28.500
Did you look at the other things?

299
00:29:30.042 --> 00:29:31.417
I've been busy with work lately.

300
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.417
So

301
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.583
I forgot.

302
00:29:37.708 --> 00:29:39.208
I often wonder

303
00:29:39.292 --> 00:29:41.417
if you think of anything else

304
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.042
other than work.

305
00:29:43.125 --> 00:29:44.042
Such as?

306
00:29:44.625 --> 00:29:47.208
Such as caring
about the people around you.

307
00:29:47.292 --> 00:29:49.083
Okay. I'll pay more attention
to that in the future.

308
00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:51.625
Since the Qin dynasty.

309
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:54.458
the Huns had repeatedly
invaded the Central Plains.

310
00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:56.500
During the reign
of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty.

311
00:29:56.583 --> 00:29:58.958
the Shandan Military Horse Farm
was established.

312
00:29:59.042 --> 00:30:02.750
giving us a cavalry force
capable of fighting against the Huns.

313
00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:04.500
The Shandan Military Horse Farm

314
00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:06.833
- was founded by Huo Qubing. right?
- Correct.

315
00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:08.833
What you all see now

316
00:30:08.917 --> 00:30:11.417
are specimen models
of Ferghana heavenly horses.

317
00:30:16.042 --> 00:30:18.875
I still think only a white horse
is fit for a prince.

318
00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:21.667
Who named you Lei Zhen?

319
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.750
My mom.

320
00:30:26.042 --> 00:30:27.083
What's wrong?

321
00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:29.000
It's better than the name Lei Zhenzi.

322
00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:35.792
Do you know how the word "champion"
became widely known?

323
00:30:37.542 --> 00:30:38.667
Please tell us.

324
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.708
Let's hear it from you.

325
00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:43.625
Seventeen-year-old Huo Qubing
followed his uncle Wei Qing

326
00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.875
to fight the Huns for the first time.

327
00:30:45.958 --> 00:30:48.333
Wei Qing only gave him 800 horsemen.

328
00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:50.208
He went deep into the enemy's territory

329
00:30:50.292 --> 00:30:52.208
straight to the rear of the Huns.

330
00:30:54.167 --> 00:30:57.417
HAN

331
00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:18.500
HAN

332
00:31:53.708 --> 00:31:55.083
The Huns

333
00:31:55.167 --> 00:31:57.500
took my daughter.

334
00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:01.333
Mother!

335
00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:06.083
Mother!

336
00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:24.333
Mother!

337
00:32:26.208 --> 00:32:27.958
Mother!

338
00:32:28.042 --> 00:32:29.083
Take good care of him.

339
00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:44.500
General.

340
00:32:44.583 --> 00:32:46.500
the Hunnic tribe
was found near the river valley.

341
00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:50.417
March through the night!

342
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.333
We must bring our people back home!

343
00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:57.917
Help!

344
00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:01.750
Please let me go!

345
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.833
Let me go!

346
00:34:06.083 --> 00:34:07.167
Zhao Zhan. Huajun.

347
00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:10.667
You each bring your men.

348
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.875
We will raid them from three directions

349
00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:15.917
to catch them off-guard.

350
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.042
- Yes. sir.
- Yes. sir.

351
00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:43.667
Lei Zhen.

352
00:35:29.458 --> 00:35:30.500
Where is my mother?

353
00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:33.333
You promised to let her go.

354
00:35:53.792 --> 00:35:54.625
Let's go.

355
00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:00.375
Lei Zhen.

356
00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:43.708
Over there!

357
00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:51.875
- Kill them all!
- Kill them all!

358
00:36:52.958 --> 00:36:54.042
The enemy is here!

359
00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:20.250
Free the people!

360
00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:36.000
Tell me where the sanctuary is.

361
00:37:36.958 --> 00:37:38.958
Only the Great Shaman knows.

362
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.875
The Hans are here!

363
00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:51.500
Guard the king!

364
00:40:04.542 --> 00:40:05.375
Block him!

365
00:40:26.167 --> 00:40:27.042
Lei Zhen!

366
00:40:56.542 --> 00:40:57.750
Hold it!

367
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.292
General's order!

368
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:01.875
Spare the women. children. and elderly!

369
00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:03.542
Those who surrender will live!

370
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.583
Yes. sir.

371
00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:14.042
Come with us.

372
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.583
- Mother!
- Mengyun!

373
00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:24.042
Are you all right?

374
00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:25.000
I'm fine.

375
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:39.417
Mother.

376
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:43.583
Mengyun.

377
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.833
you must go back to Han lands.

378
00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:47.292
Do your best

379
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.333
to live your life.

380
00:41:52.667 --> 00:41:53.667
Mother.

381
00:41:56.292 --> 00:41:59.083
Mother!

382
00:42:05.583 --> 00:42:07.917
Mother!

383
00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:15.917
Mother!

384
00:42:31.542 --> 00:42:32.708
Mother.

385
00:42:42.542 --> 00:42:43.417
Whoever

386
00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:46.375
surrenders to the Han dynasty

387
00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:48.625
will be treated with mercy.

388
00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:05.500
My father was a Hun general
who pledged allegiance to the Han dynasty.

389
00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:09.125
King Tudie invaded the city
and massacred everyone.

390
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.333
including my father.

391
00:43:13.542 --> 00:43:15.208
To ensure my safety.

392
00:43:17.042 --> 00:43:18.667
my mother gave herself to King Tudie.

393
00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:22.708
She just wanted me to live well.

394
00:43:25.292 --> 00:43:26.792
The best time of my life

395
00:43:27.458 --> 00:43:29.917
was when the two of us
looked for dandelions.

396
00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:33.083
But now she is gone.

397
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:37.542
Mengyun.

398
00:43:37.625 --> 00:43:39.667
will you go back to the garrison with me

399
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.458
and help us train the horses for battle?

400
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.625
Will you be there?

401
00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:45.750
I will.

402
00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:55.042
Mother. I can finally go back
to the Han lands.

403
00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:03.583
Zhao Zhan and Huajun.

404
00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:06.958
you two went through hardships
to bring back all these stallions.

405
00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:09.750
They have greatly strengthened
our cavalry.

406
00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:13.708
You have done a great service
for the Han dynasty.

407
00:44:13.792 --> 00:44:15.542
Your efforts are appreciated.

408
00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:16.792
We only did what we should do.

409
00:44:20.417 --> 00:44:22.000
What a nice Ferghana horse.

410
00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.333
It has a good height.

411
00:44:23.417 --> 00:44:24.750
slender limbs.

412
00:44:24.833 --> 00:44:26.958
thin skin. a small face. and a high neck.

413
00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:28.542
A good horse.

414
00:46:00.292 --> 00:46:01.167
Zhao Zhan.

415
00:46:01.708 --> 00:46:02.750
I got a letter from home.

416
00:46:02.833 --> 00:46:05.125
My father found a job for me
at the Prime Minister's bureau.

417
00:46:05.875 --> 00:46:07.083
When this battle is over.

418
00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:08.125
I will be going there.

419
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.250
You might as well.

420
00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:13.167
Three generations of your family

421
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.583
held office in the imperial court.

422
00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:16.083
You are the only son in the family.

423
00:46:16.167 --> 00:46:19.208
People say one should not travel far
from their parents' side.

424
00:46:37.417 --> 00:46:39.333
Have you ever
thought of starting a family?

425
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.875
A family?

426
00:46:51.583 --> 00:46:53.167
I lost my family at a very young age.

427
00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:55.292
I was born at the frontier.

428
00:46:56.417 --> 00:46:57.667
The Huns

429
00:46:58.458 --> 00:46:59.833
destroyed my family.

430
00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:02.708
The Huns are not yet eliminated.

431
00:47:02.792 --> 00:47:04.375
How can I talk about starting a family?

432
00:47:05.458 --> 00:47:06.417
Indeed.

433
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.083
Extinguishing such threats
is the top priority.

434
00:47:18.083 --> 00:47:19.167
The general is here.

435
00:47:21.792 --> 00:47:23.333
- General.
- General.

436
00:47:23.417 --> 00:47:26.125
General. you bred
excellent warhorses for the country.

437
00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:27.292
Now.

438
00:47:27.375 --> 00:47:29.583
we also have our own cavalry regiments.

439
00:47:30.417 --> 00:47:32.333
The Huns
repeatedly invaded our Han territory.

440
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.708
We are Han soldiers.

441
00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:37.875
The scourge that is the Hun

442
00:47:37.958 --> 00:47:39.042
must be eliminated!

443
00:47:39.792 --> 00:47:41.708
I believe that in the future.

444
00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:44.000
in this land of our nation.

445
00:47:44.833 --> 00:47:46.417
there will be peace and prosperity.

446
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.917
People will live and work
in peace and contentment.

447
00:48:03.625 --> 00:48:05.667
Huo Qubing built his fame in this battle

448
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.292
with incomparable military achievements.

449
00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:09.583
Emperor Wu named him "Champion Marquis."

450
00:48:09.667 --> 00:48:11.708
This is how the word "champion"
became widely known.

451
00:48:12.792 --> 00:48:15.292
Although Huo Qubing lived a short life.

452
00:48:15.375 --> 00:48:17.833
he repeatedly inflicted heavy losses
on the Huns

453
00:48:17.917 --> 00:48:21.708
and formed a superior cavalry army
for the Han dynasty.

454
00:48:21.792 --> 00:48:23.042
Later. the Han dynasty

455
00:48:23.125 --> 00:48:25.000
was able to open up the Hexi Corridor

456
00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:26.833
and establish
the Western Regions Protectorate

457
00:48:26.917 --> 00:48:29.083
to consolidate rule
over the Xinjiang region.

458
00:48:29.167 --> 00:48:30.875
Huo Qubing
laid the foundation for all that.

459
00:48:31.958 --> 00:48:33.125
Professor.

460
00:48:33.208 --> 00:48:35.708
doesn't the general on the white horse
look like Wang Jing?

461
00:48:35.792 --> 00:48:36.958
Like Wang Jing?

462
00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:42.083
Not really.

463
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.250
Wang Jing is on your mind.

464
00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:46.375
- Professor.
- No. I--

465
00:48:48.417 --> 00:48:49.542
This is really something.

466
00:48:49.625 --> 00:48:51.917
There are so many different shapes
of gold nuggets.

467
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.917
These are hoof-shaped gold nuggets.

468
00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:55.750
Tell me.

469
00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:58.833
With all the gold contributed
from the Han.

470
00:48:58.917 --> 00:49:00.542
where could the Huns have stored it?

471
00:49:00.625 --> 00:49:03.625
It is recorded that Huo Qubing
once seized the Huns' golden statue

472
00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:05.333
used to worship heaven.

473
00:49:05.417 --> 00:49:07.542
Would it be possible
that the gold and treasures

474
00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:10.000
were sent to the Huns' sanctuary
for worship?

475
00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:14.375
Up until now. no Hun sanctuary
has ever been discovered.

476
00:49:14.458 --> 00:49:15.917
However. since you develop games.

477
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.625
feel free to use your creativity.

478
00:49:18.708 --> 00:49:21.208
I certainly want to add in
a treasure-hunting element.

479
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:25.042
If only you could lead us
to find the Huns' sanctuary.

480
00:49:25.125 --> 00:49:26.875
that would be so cool.

481
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.917
That's too difficult.

482
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.458
It's so beautiful.

483
00:49:32.083 --> 00:49:33.083
You have good taste.

484
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.083
For this souvenir bracelet.

485
00:49:35.167 --> 00:49:38.333
we used gold to make
an exact replica of the original.

486
00:49:38.417 --> 00:49:39.583
It's definitely a great value.

487
00:49:39.667 --> 00:49:40.500
GOLD BRACELET

488
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.667
It's perfect for me. isn't it?

489
00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:45.542
The price of gold has skyrocketed.

490
00:49:55.083 --> 00:49:56.167
Professor.

491
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.375
I have a good friend
who is a shamanic scholar.

492
00:49:58.458 --> 00:49:59.708
He recently came back to China.

493
00:49:59.792 --> 00:50:03.125
He knows the shamanic culture
and the history of the Huns very well.

494
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:04.625
He invited us to visit him.

495
00:50:04.708 --> 00:50:06.792
We can talk about the totem
on the jade pendant.

496
00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.083
We can surely compare notes.

497
00:50:08.167 --> 00:50:09.417
- I will arrange a time.
- Okay.

498
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.667
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

499
00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.333
What's next?

500
00:50:12.417 --> 00:50:13.625
- Let's have tea.
- Great.

501
00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:14.958
- Let's go.
- After you.

502
00:50:16.667 --> 00:50:17.750
Gold is expensive.

503
00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:18.792
Forget about it.

504
00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:19.708
Let's go.

505
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.750
Yes. it's too expensive.

506
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.708
What's the fuss?

507
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Professor. your mask looks good.

508
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.583
Xinran taught me how to use it.

509
00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:45.500
The tacky wet feeling is uncomfortable.

510
00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:47.000
Professor. can I take it off?

511
00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:49.458
Hydrating your skin is good.

512
00:50:50.542 --> 00:50:51.958
What do you want at this early hour?

513
00:50:53.333 --> 00:50:54.958
I drew a picture with AI.

514
00:50:55.042 --> 00:50:57.292
This was the woman in my dream.

515
00:50:59.042 --> 00:50:59.917
It's so similar!

516
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.167
Similar to what?

517
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.750
To the one I saw in my dream.

518
00:51:03.833 --> 00:51:05.167
Professor. how can it be possible?

519
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.917
Did we both dream of the same person?

520
00:51:07.417 --> 00:51:09.792
Maybe it's because we've both
been working on the jade pendant

521
00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:11.625
and doing the same research work.

522
00:51:11.708 --> 00:51:13.583
so we had the same dream.

523
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.500
Professor. why does it feel

524
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:20.625
like it was my memories
of another time and space?

525
00:51:21.208 --> 00:51:23.833
Dreams are more than the workings
of the brain's memory system

526
00:51:23.917 --> 00:51:25.000
in our dormant state.

527
00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:26.042
In fact.

528
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:28.875
the brain's ability to create
is also functioning.

529
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:31.708
That's why dreams
are also both fantasy and reality.

530
00:51:33.833 --> 00:51:34.917
A dream is not reality.

531
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.500
We still have to come back
to the real world.

532
00:51:38.667 --> 00:51:40.292
Okay. Professor. I'm back.

533
00:51:40.375 --> 00:51:41.333
I have things to do.

534
00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:43.333
Where are you going?

535
00:51:43.417 --> 00:51:44.875
I'm going to find Xinran.

536
00:51:46.375 --> 00:51:48.875
A man should take the initiative.

537
00:51:49.417 --> 00:51:50.917
- Okay.
- Hey.

538
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.250
Your mask.

539
00:51:57.333 --> 00:51:58.625
Professor. I'll just put it here.

540
00:52:26.458 --> 00:52:29.125
No need for housekeeping! Thank you!

541
00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:30.542
It's Wang Jing.

542
00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:34.750
What's up?

543
00:52:36.083 --> 00:52:37.125
I have something for you.

544
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:45.208
No. this won't do.

545
00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:47.292
Just a minute!

546
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:51.375
I will be there right away.

547
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:56.208
Hi.

548
00:52:59.125 --> 00:52:59.958
Hi.

549
00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:03.375
I have something for you.

550
00:53:04.125 --> 00:53:05.000
What?

551
00:53:05.833 --> 00:53:06.667
This.

552
00:53:11.333 --> 00:53:13.333
It's not a lab test list
this time. is it?

553
00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:19.042
The price of gold has skyrocketed.

554
00:53:19.125 --> 00:53:20.375
I invested some money.

555
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.333
Is it for me?

556
00:53:23.458 --> 00:53:24.333
Yes.

557
00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:32.000
I'll go now.

558
00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:33.000
Wait.

559
00:53:34.917 --> 00:53:37.875
I made coffee.

560
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:40.208
Do you want to come inside for some?

561
00:53:40.292 --> 00:53:42.083
No. I already had some this morning.
Thank you.

562
00:53:43.375 --> 00:53:44.333
I also have tea.

563
00:53:46.042 --> 00:53:47.750
Black tea. green tea. and oolong tea.

564
00:53:48.583 --> 00:53:49.542
I have all of them.

565
00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:52.792
Tea will keep me up at night.

566
00:53:52.875 --> 00:53:53.792
- Fruit?
- No. thank you.

567
00:53:53.875 --> 00:53:55.167
Soft drinks? Biscuits?

568
00:54:07.458 --> 00:54:08.458
I've got him.

569
00:54:27.917 --> 00:54:28.750
Take it.

570
00:54:38.042 --> 00:54:39.125
Let me add some seasoning.

571
00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:44.833
It smells so good.

572
00:54:45.417 --> 00:54:46.375
Mengyun.

573
00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.542
I have something to show you.

574
00:54:51.208 --> 00:54:52.375
What is it?

575
00:55:04.917 --> 00:55:05.917
It's so beautiful.

576
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:08.208
Do you like it?

577
00:55:10.125 --> 00:55:11.208
This is my family heirloom.

578
00:55:11.292 --> 00:55:13.083
I want to give it to you
before I go to battle.

579
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.208
I can't take something so valuable.

580
00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:23.875
You should give it
to the person you value most.

581
00:55:33.458 --> 00:55:35.458
Can you hold on to it for me?

582
00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:37.375
Give it back to me
when I return victorious.

583
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.333
Something this valuable
must not fall into the enemy's hands.

584
00:55:43.375 --> 00:55:44.208
General.

585
00:55:45.167 --> 00:55:46.667
thank you for saving my child's life.

586
00:55:50.542 --> 00:55:51.417
Huajun!

587
00:55:52.333 --> 00:55:54.000
Come eat! We will head out soon!

588
00:55:59.958 --> 00:56:01.000
Let's drink.

589
00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:02.375
- Come on.

Professor. we have arrived.

612
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:23.625
Hello.

613
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:24.542
- Hi.
- Hello.

614
00:58:24.625 --> 00:58:25.792
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

615
00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:40.500
Please wait here.

616
00:58:47.708 --> 00:58:48.958
Mr. Herbert.

617
00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:50.208
the guests are here.

618
00:58:51.292 --> 00:58:52.208
Please sit.

619
00:58:52.292 --> 00:58:55.500
Mr. Herbert. this is an archaeologist.
Professor Fang. with Wang Jing and Xinran.

620
00:58:55.583 --> 00:58:56.417
Hi.

621
00:58:57.833 --> 00:58:59.625
Hello. Mr. Herbert.

622
00:58:59.708 --> 00:59:02.375
We found this jade pendant
in our excavation site.

623
00:59:03.042 --> 00:59:05.000
I was told you are an expert in shamanism.

624
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:06.750
I hope you can tell me more about it.

625
00:59:09.833 --> 00:59:10.750
Thank you.

626
00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:35.667
In shamanic culture.

627
00:59:36.292 --> 00:59:38.583
this is
the oldest seven-star divine totem.

628
00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:41.000
Ever since this jade pendant
was unearthed.

629
00:59:41.083 --> 00:59:42.667
every night the professor and I

630
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.167
dream of the same person.

631
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:45.625
But not me.

632
00:59:45.708 --> 00:59:46.583
Moreover--

633
00:59:47.833 --> 00:59:49.000
There are objects

634
00:59:49.542 --> 00:59:52.333
that allow us to communicate
with the deceased

635
00:59:52.417 --> 00:59:55.083
and even with the gods.

636
00:59:55.917 --> 00:59:57.583
This shamanic scepter

637
00:59:57.667 --> 00:59:58.917
is an antiquity that I collected

638
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.667
a few years back in Europe.

639
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.875
The crystal on it also brought me

640
01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:06.708
the same experience as yours.

641
01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:10.167
Similarly.

642
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.667
jade is a medium of communication
with the gods.

643
01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:17.125
All things have a spirit.

644
01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:18.667
When life ends.

645
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.625
the spirit is still there.

646
01:00:20.708 --> 01:00:23.333
Jade carries the spirit of the dead.

647
01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:25.333
It uses dreams as a medium

648
01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:27.958
to establish a connection

649
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:29.833
with the living.

650
01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.958
Professor. let's meditate together.

651
01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:37.000
Maybe you'll be able

652
01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:38.750
to find the answer you're looking for.

653
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.250
Professor.

654
01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:47.750
let's meditate.

655
01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:57.917
Feel the flow of energy in your brain.

656
01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:00.833
Break the limitations of time and space.

657
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.083
Expand the realm of your thoughts.

658
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.042
Elevate spiritual wisdom.

659
01:01:23.292 --> 01:01:24.875
Has he fallen asleep already?

660
01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:43.583
General.

661
01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.000
we've conquered
five Hun tribes in six days.

662
01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:46.917
- General.
- General.

663
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:47.958
Our wounded soldiers

664
01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:50.417
need a few days' time to recover
before they can go on.

665
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.375
General.

666
01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:54.208
General.

667
01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.333
General.

668
01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:57.542
Rest for now.

669
01:01:58.833 --> 01:01:59.750
All right.

670
01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:08.500
Report!

671
01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:14.958
General.

672
01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:17.458
Huduna joined forces
with the Xiutu and the Zhelan tribes.

673
01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:20.042
They have amassed many troops
at Gaolan Mountain up ahead.

674
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.083
How many troops are there?

675
01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:25.875
Tens of thousands.

676
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.625
General.

677
01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:28.750
we are outnumbered.

678
01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.750
Let's avoid a direct confrontation
and take a detour.

679
01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:33.667
General.

680
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.667
we are thousands of miles away
from Han lands.

681
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.417
We must pass through Gaolan Mountain.

682
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.750
If we go around it.
there is Qilian Mountain in the south.

683
01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:44.583
If we go north.
we will end up in Hun territory.

684
01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:52.875
When one walks into the valley of death.

685
01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:55.750
he will have nothing more to lose.

686
01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:58.542
Convey my order. We regroup here.

687
01:02:59.417 --> 01:03:00.917
Soldiers and horses

688
01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:03.125
must rest and eat well.

689
01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:04.875
Spend the night building fortifications.

690
01:03:04.958 --> 01:03:05.792
Yes. sir.

691
01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:06.792
Yes. sir.

692
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.792
We already know

693
01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:15.375
the Huns are not ashamed to flee

694
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.667
or retreat when they suffer losses.

695
01:03:19.667 --> 01:03:21.958
We'll use the Ring Pommel Sword Regiment

696
01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.208
to break up their formation.

697
01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:26.958
Inflicting maximum casualties
is our best tactic to win.

698
01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:28.667
Zhao Zhan.

699
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:31.625
the Ring Pommel Sword Regiment
will be under your command.

700
01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:32.708
Remember.

701
01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:34.958
Huduna must be taken down.

702
01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:37.083
Yes. sir.

703
01:03:43.292 --> 01:03:44.250
Soldiers.

704
01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:46.833
if you are the only son in your family.

705
01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:48.208
come forward.

706
01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:55.417
If you have a wife and children.

707
01:03:56.042 --> 01:03:56.917
come forward.

708
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.292
The rest of you

709
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.333
will become a part

710
01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:08.750
of my Ring Pommel Sword Regiment.

711
01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:11.125
In this battle.

712
01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:13.083
the Ring Pommel Sword Regiment
under my command

713
01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:14.667
will take the lead in the charge.

714
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.375
We are facing our deadly enemy.

715
01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:18.917
The life-and-death moment
for our Han army has arrived.

716
01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:22.958
I want to join
the Ring Pommel Sword Regiment!

717
01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:26.208
We are soldiers who defend our homeland.

718
01:04:27.042 --> 01:04:28.250
We fight on the battlefield

719
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:30.375
and do not fear death.

720
01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:32.083
We will follow you to our death!

721
01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:38.583
- We will follow you to our death!
- We will follow you to our death!

722
01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:44.917
- We will follow you to our death!
- We will follow you to our death!

723
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.083
Let's head out!

724
01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:06.625
This jade pendant

725
01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:08.333
was given to me by the Great Shaman

726
01:05:08.417 --> 01:05:09.625
to keep me safe.

727
01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:12.042
I want to give it to you.

728
01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:17.375
I've been a soldier for most of my life.

729
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.417
Protecting our country and our people
is my only wish.

730
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.208
Please keep this jade pendant

731
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.208
close to you.

732
01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:25.875
I hope it will protect you.

733
01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:28.333
Your wish will surely be fulfilled.

734
01:05:29.417 --> 01:05:30.750
This jade is like my pure heart.

735
01:05:31.417 --> 01:05:33.583
I just hope
it will cast away all evil for you.

736
01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:35.583
My wish

737
01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:37.042
is for you to be safe.

738
01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:25.000
Come back safely.

739
01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:14.792
Soldiers.

740
01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.792
We are outnumbered in this battle.
Death is hovering over us.

741
01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:19.542
We would rather die in glory

742
01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:21.167
than live in shame!

743
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.458
In this battle.

744
01:07:24.042 --> 01:07:26.500
we shall demonstrate
the Han army's majestic power

745
01:07:26.583 --> 01:07:28.042
so that our enemy

746
01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:31.042
doesn't dare to oppress our people
or invade our land anymore!

747
01:07:40.375 --> 01:07:41.792
Gaolan Mountain

748
01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.333
will be the Han soldiers'

749
01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:47.333
burial ground!

750
01:07:53.042 --> 01:07:54.708
The peace of our country and home

751
01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:56.375
is forged by heroes!

752
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.917
- The peace of our country and home
- The peace of our country and home

753
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.375
- is forged by heroes!
- is forged by heroes!

754
01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:01.042
Forged by heroes!

755
01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:02.667
Charge!

756
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.333
Ring Pommel Sword Regiment!

757
01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.582
Get around and outflank them!

758
01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:52.457
Attack from both sides!

759
01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:54.917
Attack from both sides!

760
01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:04.042
Shoot the arrows!

761
01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:05.458
Shoot!

762
01:10:17.042 --> 01:10:18.125
Shoot!

763
01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.583
Shoot!

764
01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:40.958
Fall back!

765
01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:49.208
Batuo.

766
01:11:49.292 --> 01:11:50.292
retreat!

767
01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:23.958
Huduna was defeated.

768
01:12:24.042 --> 01:12:25.375
My lord. should we advance?

769
01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.125
Kill them all!

770
01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:29.250
Kill them all!

771
01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:42.917
Get out of here!

772
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:43.958
Retreat!

773
01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:54.625
Retreat!

774
01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:56.958
Let's go!

775
01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:02.000
Get into position!

776
01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:56.000
Lei Zhen!

777
01:17:21.167 --> 01:17:22.125
General!

778
01:17:23.375 --> 01:17:25.500
Go get them!

779
01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:36.833
Let's go!

780
01:17:58.417 --> 01:17:59.292
Medic!

781
01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:00.417
HAN

782
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.417
Medic!

783
01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:03.375
- General!
- General!

784
01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:05.375
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

785
01:18:05.458 --> 01:18:06.917
- Quickly!
- Hurry!

786
01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:09.958
General. are you okay?

787
01:18:10.042 --> 01:18:10.917
I am fine.

788
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.000
Medic. hurry up!

789
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.167
Let me take a look.

790
01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:30.083
He has been poisoned.

791
01:18:30.167 --> 01:18:31.125
Remove his armor.

792
01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:49.958
The cut is deep.

793
01:18:50.042 --> 01:18:51.583
I have to bandage your wound right away.

794
01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:53.000
I am fine.

795
01:18:53.792 --> 01:18:54.958
I will go get the herbs.

796
01:18:56.667 --> 01:18:57.708
Hang on.

797
01:18:58.792 --> 01:19:00.333
I will suck the poison out.

798
01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:29.375
This is a special poison
made by the Huns.

799
01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:32.208
Only the Great Shaman has the antidote.

800
01:19:32.292 --> 01:19:34.583
I can only halt the spread of the poison.

801
01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.875
I will immediately go
and find the Great Shaman.

802
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:48.500
The pendant.

803
01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:51.500
Take it.

804
01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:53.708
Let it...

805
01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.250
keep you safe.

806
01:20:13.167 --> 01:20:14.500
I am counting on you.

807
01:20:25.292 --> 01:20:27.375
General. don't move
or your wound will open.

808
01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:28.500
I know.

809
01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:30.042
Zhao Zhan.

810
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:32.083
Zhao Zhan.

811
01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:34.667
I can hardly hold out any longer.

812
01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:37.500
Protect her every step of the way.

813
01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:40.000
I'm counting on you.

814
01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:41.167
Zhao Zhan. say no more.

815
01:20:42.542 --> 01:20:43.958
I will do my best to protect her

816
01:20:44.042 --> 01:20:45.583
and bring the antidote back to save you.

817
01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:56.667
Lei Zhen.

818
01:20:57.333 --> 01:20:59.042
can you still go through this with me?

819
01:21:09.083 --> 01:21:09.958
I will go with you.

820
01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:15.292
The sanctuary will be past these woods.

821
01:22:15.375 --> 01:22:16.750
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

822
01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:17.958
Please wait here.

823
01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:19.167
I will come back soon.

824
01:22:32.417 --> 01:22:33.375
Lei Zhen.

825
01:22:34.542 --> 01:22:35.542
Lei Zhen.

826
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.375
Lei Zhen.

827
01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:06.917
you have fulfilled your duty well.

828
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:25.042
Great Shaman.
please grant me the antidote.

829
01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:26.917
Child.

830
01:23:28.292 --> 01:23:29.667
stay here with me.

831
01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:34.167
You two are not meant
for each other in this life.

832
01:23:38.292 --> 01:23:40.542
My only wish is for him to live.

833
01:23:46.917 --> 01:23:49.583
There is only enough of the antidote
to save one person.

834
01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:42.917
How do you feel?

835
01:24:43.417 --> 01:24:45.083
I've just taken the antidote.

836
01:24:45.167 --> 01:24:46.750
I will be all right soon.

837
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.417
Hurry back now
and give the antidote to the general.

838
01:25:00.458 --> 01:25:01.583
What about you?

839
01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.000
The Great Shaman needs me here.

840
01:25:12.417 --> 01:25:13.625
Huajun.

841
01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:16.333
I'm returning this bracelet to you.

842
01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:21.042
I cannot keep it for you anymore.

843
01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.625
Thank you for being kind to me.

844
01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:04.875
You must help me bring it to him

845
01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:06.667
to save his life.

846
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:07.833
Do you understand?

847
01:26:15.792 --> 01:26:17.625
You must reach there before sunrise.

848
01:26:18.583 --> 01:26:19.500
Farewell.

849
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.000
Because of him.

850
01:27:06.583 --> 01:27:08.333
you're giving up your own life.

851
01:27:09.708 --> 01:27:10.750
Is it worth it?

852
01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:21.333
I know you're here to ask the Great Shaman

853
01:27:21.417 --> 01:27:22.542
for an antidote.

854
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:24.083
Tell me

855
01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:25.917
where the sanctuary is.

856
01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:35.417
I must avenge my mother today.

857
01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:37.167
Get her.

858
01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:54.708
Mengyun.

859
01:28:55.542 --> 01:28:57.417
you can't die for another man.

860
01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.458
If you want to die.

861
01:29:00.542 --> 01:29:02.167
you can only die by my hand.

862
01:29:50.375 --> 01:29:51.542
The sanctuary.

863
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:53.917
Where the hell is it?

864
01:33:49.417 --> 01:33:50.417
Huajun!

865
01:33:52.167 --> 01:33:53.167
Huajun!

866
01:33:53.667 --> 01:33:54.542
Huajun.

867
01:33:56.333 --> 01:33:57.208
Huajun.

868
01:33:59.083 --> 01:34:00.708
Give the antidote to the general quickly.

869
01:34:02.958 --> 01:34:03.833
All right.

870
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.167
Go quickly.

871
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.708
Come save the general!

872
01:34:10.667 --> 01:34:12.292
Come save the general!

873
01:34:14.833 --> 01:34:15.917
Zhao Zhan.

874
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.125
I will bring the antidote back
to save you.

875
01:34:18.958 --> 01:34:20.458
Mengyun.

876
01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:23.292
I kept my promise to you.

877
01:35:09.417 --> 01:35:11.000
- The peace of our country and home
- The peace of our country and home

878
01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:12.458
- is forged by heroes!
- is forged by heroes!

879
01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.333
Forged by heroes!

880
01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:56.250
General.

881
01:36:10.833 --> 01:36:12.167
Huajun!

882
01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:16.333
Huajun.

883
01:37:19.208 --> 01:37:20.208
Mr. Herbert.

884
01:37:20.292 --> 01:37:21.917
is there a glacier up ahead?

885
01:37:22.542 --> 01:37:23.458
Yes.

886
01:37:24.083 --> 01:37:26.917
There is indeed a 10.000-year-old glacier.

887
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:27.833
Professor.

888
01:37:28.417 --> 01:37:30.125
I think I dreamed
about that place just now.

889
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:41.500
Can we go there to have a look?

890
01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:43.833
If you want to go.

891
01:37:43.917 --> 01:37:47.625
I can arrange for some local guides
to take you there.

892
01:37:48.542 --> 01:37:51.750
Maybe you can find the answers
you are looking for.

893
01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:53.417
Thank you. Mr. Herbert.

894
01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:01.958
- Let's go.
- Professor.

895
01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:04.083
- Lei Zhen.
- I also had a dream.

896
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:07.083
I dreamed that Wang Jing and I

897
01:38:07.167 --> 01:38:08.833
were surfing by a beach in Sanya.

898
01:38:08.917 --> 01:38:10.333
- I was wearing a bikini.
- Let's go.

899
01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:11.292
I also...

900
01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:13.000
Wang Jing?

901
01:38:13.083 --> 01:38:14.292
Why are we leaving?

902
01:38:15.833 --> 01:38:16.667
My legs are numb.

903
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:17.875
Did you dream about anything?

904
01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:20.208
- Just as I dozed off. you woke me.
- Was I in your dream?

905
01:38:20.292 --> 01:38:22.208
- No.
- Was I in Wang Jing's dream?

906
01:38:52.417 --> 01:38:54.625
Professor.
there's a very big cave up ahead!

907
01:38:54.708 --> 01:38:56.208
Let's go over there!

908
01:39:16.167 --> 01:39:18.208
Come over here. Get prepared.

909
01:39:18.292 --> 01:39:20.458
Wang Jing said you looked good in a skirt.

910
01:39:20.542 --> 01:39:22.083
but this is really too much.

911
01:39:22.167 --> 01:39:23.250
I'm not cold.

912
01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:24.958
Besides. there are no organs in the legs.

913
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.125
Let's take a look inside.

914
01:39:30.917 --> 01:39:32.125
The cave is so big.

915
01:39:32.208 --> 01:39:33.625
Do you think it will be dangerous?

916
01:39:48.833 --> 01:39:49.792
Come on.

917
01:39:59.833 --> 01:40:01.583
These subglacial bubbles are all methane

918
01:40:01.667 --> 01:40:03.042
and highly flammable.

919
01:40:03.125 --> 01:40:04.458
Be careful with naked flames.

920
01:40:04.542 --> 01:40:05.375
Okay.

921
01:40:07.542 --> 01:40:08.417
Wait for me.

922
01:40:09.292 --> 01:40:10.542
Everyone. be careful.

923
01:40:11.375 --> 01:40:12.583
Professor.

924
01:40:12.667 --> 01:40:14.042
can we take a break?

925
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.125
This is a dead end.

926
01:40:21.667 --> 01:40:22.500
Let's head back.

927
01:40:59.042 --> 01:41:00.292
Wang Jing. quick.

928
01:41:00.375 --> 01:41:01.375
Give me a hand.

929
01:41:03.458 --> 01:41:04.375
Are you okay?

930
01:41:10.375 --> 01:41:11.375
My back.

931
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:14.333
My back hurts.

932
01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:26.917
What is this place?

933
01:41:48.542 --> 01:41:51.542
Jackpot!

934
01:41:52.417 --> 01:41:53.542
It's so beautiful.

935
01:41:53.625 --> 01:41:54.792
- Wang Jing. hurry!
- I'm coming.

936
01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:55.875
Come here!

937
01:41:56.542 --> 01:41:57.750
So the ancient Huns

938
01:41:57.833 --> 01:41:59.292
did in fact have a sanctuary.

939
01:42:25.208 --> 01:42:26.750
Professor. look at that.

940
01:42:28.958 --> 01:42:31.042
It's the seven-star divine totem
on the jade pendant.

941
01:42:35.375 --> 01:42:36.375
Professor.

942
01:42:36.458 --> 01:42:37.667
there must be a secret vault

943
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:40.042
or a hidden mechanism
waiting for you to discover.

944
01:42:40.125 --> 01:42:41.250
Games have gotten into you.

945
01:42:41.333 --> 01:42:43.750
Do you really think
that if you push a button on the wall.

946
01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:45.500
the top and bottom sections will open up

947
01:42:45.583 --> 01:42:47.083
and the sides will rumble?

948
01:42:49.417 --> 01:42:50.667
Professor.

949
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:53.375
what was all that gibberish?

950
01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:55.167
Let's go.
We'll talk more when we get back.

951
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:56.708
- Professor.
- Professor.

952
01:43:01.792 --> 01:43:03.083
Do I look familiar?

953
01:43:04.542 --> 01:43:05.708
Mr. Herbert.

954
01:43:11.333 --> 01:43:13.583
You were quite handsome
when you were young. right?

955
01:43:19.083 --> 01:43:22.125
The reason I am here
is to get back the treasure that was mine.

956
01:43:22.625 --> 01:43:24.792
- You cannot step on it.
- Don't step on it.

957
01:43:24.875 --> 01:43:26.292
The script on the wall

958
01:43:26.375 --> 01:43:27.917
should be able to help. right?

959
01:43:28.917 --> 01:43:30.458
"Humans driven by greed

960
01:43:30.542 --> 01:43:33.000
plunder resources and kill one another.

961
01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:35.167
Human civilization
is constantly destroyed and rebuilt.

962
01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:37.125
Destroyed and rebuilt again.

963
01:43:37.667 --> 01:43:39.958
People who loved peace and freedom

964
01:43:40.042 --> 01:43:42.667
constructed a utopia
of peaceful coexistence

965
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:44.167
and mutual respect

966
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:46.458
beneath the surface of the earth.

967
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.333
Only the kindhearted can enter.

968
01:43:52.833 --> 01:43:56.792
Those who force their entry out of greed
will definitely be punished."

969
01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.583
You're indeed a professor.

970
01:44:02.208 --> 01:44:04.250
You make bullshit sound so serious.

971
01:44:06.625 --> 01:44:07.750
However. Professor.

972
01:44:08.792 --> 01:44:10.292
I want to be punished.

973
01:44:10.875 --> 01:44:12.208
How do I get in?

974
01:44:12.292 --> 01:44:13.792
Boss. take a look.

975
01:44:15.375 --> 01:44:17.750
There's a huge space behind this wall.

976
01:44:22.458 --> 01:44:23.458
Thank you. Professor.

977
01:44:24.917 --> 01:44:25.958
We finally found it.

978
01:44:27.625 --> 01:44:29.292
Vincent. TNT.

979
01:44:29.375 --> 01:44:30.875
- Yes. sir.
- What?

980
01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.875
Mr. Herbert.
is it really necessary to blast it?

981
01:44:34.958 --> 01:44:37.250
Shut up if you want the rest of the money.

982
01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:41.708
He's in on it.

983
01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:44.292
Lei Zhen. you...

984
01:44:48.708 --> 01:44:49.792
Wait!

985
01:44:49.875 --> 01:44:51.208
- Don't bomb it!
- Wait!

986
01:44:51.292 --> 01:44:53.333
A 1.000-year-old cultural relic
must not be blown up!

987
01:44:53.417 --> 01:44:54.708
- You can't blow it up!
- Boss.

988
01:44:54.792 --> 01:44:56.375
I also think we shouldn't blow it up.

989
01:44:56.458 --> 01:44:58.542
This is a confined space.
With an explosion. we--

990
01:45:07.542 --> 01:45:08.708
Don't blow it up.

991
01:46:29.458 --> 01:46:30.625
A hibiscus tree?

992
01:46:31.208 --> 01:46:32.333
This one?

993
01:46:32.417 --> 01:46:34.042
It should be

994
01:46:34.125 --> 01:46:36.000
a bronze sacred tree.

995
01:46:36.083 --> 01:46:38.708
What is this golden tree's purpose?

996
01:46:39.458 --> 01:46:40.458
For worship.

997
01:46:41.458 --> 01:46:43.500
It's a stairway for ancient people

998
01:46:45.292 --> 01:46:47.250
to reach out to gods and the universe.

999
01:46:49.625 --> 01:46:51.125
Golden statue for worshiping heaven.

1000
01:46:52.875 --> 01:46:54.833
I've finally found you.

1001
01:46:55.917 --> 01:46:57.250
It doesn't belong to you.

1002
01:46:58.417 --> 01:47:00.042
It belongs to all mankind.

1003
01:47:01.625 --> 01:47:04.667
Do you know that theft
of national first-class cultural relics

1004
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:06.708
is punishable by life imprisonment?

1005
01:47:06.792 --> 01:47:08.542
Even if you flee to another country.

1006
01:47:08.625 --> 01:47:10.292
you will still be extradited.

1007
01:47:10.375 --> 01:47:12.292
Won't your folks be disappointed?

1008
01:47:14.292 --> 01:47:15.167
Herbert.

1009
01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:17.958
I don't want the rest of the money.

1010
01:47:18.042 --> 01:47:19.292
I can even pay you back.

1011
01:47:21.167 --> 01:47:22.333
I am done with this.

1012
01:47:22.417 --> 01:47:23.750
- Tie them up.
- What are you doing?

1013
01:47:23.833 --> 01:47:25.208
- Come on.
- Hands up.

1014
01:47:25.292 --> 01:47:26.208
I am pulling out. okay?

1015
01:47:26.292 --> 01:47:27.500
Calm down.

1016
01:47:27.583 --> 01:47:28.667
Go.

1017
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:29.625
Over there.

1018
01:47:29.708 --> 01:47:31.000
- Come on.
- Take it easy.

1019
01:47:31.083 --> 01:47:31.958
Come on.

1020
01:47:32.583 --> 01:47:33.625
Go.

1021
01:47:33.708 --> 01:47:34.625
- Come on.
- Go.

1022
01:47:34.708 --> 01:47:35.542
Don't push them.

1023
01:47:36.625 --> 01:47:38.167
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

1024
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:39.292
Move.

1025
01:47:41.667 --> 01:47:43.708
Take it. Find a chance to escape.

1026
01:47:46.125 --> 01:47:46.958
Hands.

1027
01:47:47.042 --> 01:47:48.042
Give me your hands.

1028
01:47:50.167 --> 01:47:52.125
Buddy. don't tie them so tightly.

1029
01:47:55.375 --> 01:47:57.125
- Let's look over there.
- All right.

1030
01:48:17.042 --> 01:48:20.333
Boys. TNT on those six pillars.

1031
01:48:20.417 --> 01:48:21.292
Yes. sir.

1032
01:48:29.958 --> 01:48:31.875
Boss. there's a vast hollow space below.

1033
01:48:31.958 --> 01:48:32.875
Look.

1034
01:48:34.625 --> 01:48:36.000
It seems there are some buildings.

1035
01:48:38.292 --> 01:48:39.917
Let's first blast the golden statue.

1036
01:48:45.292 --> 01:48:46.500
Professor.

1037
01:48:46.583 --> 01:48:47.708
Shut up.

1038
01:48:49.583 --> 01:48:51.375
We can't let them destroy the artifacts.

1039
01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:52.958
I'll find a way to stop the explosion.

1040
01:48:53.042 --> 01:48:54.792
You three get out of here quickly.

1041
01:48:54.875 --> 01:48:57.625
We're all tied up.
How can we get out of here?

1042
01:48:57.708 --> 01:48:58.833
I'm not.

1043
01:49:03.417 --> 01:49:05.125
Xinran. get ready to take the knife.

1044
01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:13.208
Take it.

1045
01:49:17.667 --> 01:49:18.542
Kick him!

1046
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:22.500
Kick him. not me!

1047
01:49:22.583 --> 01:49:23.708
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't me.

1048
01:49:28.667 --> 01:49:29.833
- Leave now!
- Okay!

1049
01:49:38.917 --> 01:49:40.125
When I count to three. run!

1050
01:49:44.792 --> 01:49:46.000
So fast.

1051
01:49:46.083 --> 01:49:47.875
Lei Zhen. if you're a friend.

1052
01:49:47.958 --> 01:49:50.000
quickly get Xinran out of here
and call the police.

1053
01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:51.000
What about you?

1054
01:49:51.708 --> 01:49:52.833
I have to help the professor.

1055
01:49:52.917 --> 01:49:55.375
No. I'm staying with you.
We stick together.

1056
01:49:58.708 --> 01:49:59.625
Take it.

1057
01:49:59.708 --> 01:50:01.667
When this is all over.
I'll be your boyfriend.

1058
01:50:04.542 --> 01:50:05.417
What did he say?

1059
01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:08.625
He will be my boyfriend?

1060
01:50:08.708 --> 01:50:10.583
Stop being so lovey-dovey. Let's go!

1061
01:50:10.667 --> 01:50:12.375
Wang Jing. I'll wait for you!

1062
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.000
- Professor.
- Why are you back?

1063
01:50:15.083 --> 01:50:16.125
I'm here to help you.

1064
01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:18.083
Stay behind me.

1065
01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:20.125
I'll be waiting for you!

1066
01:50:21.792 --> 01:50:23.375
Don't look! Get down!

1067
01:50:27.292 --> 01:50:28.750
- Lei Zhen!
- Lei Zhen!

1068
01:50:34.542 --> 01:50:35.958
- I'm out of bullets.
- What do we do?

1069
01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.625
Go!

1070
01:50:37.708 --> 01:50:39.042
Kill them all!

1071
01:50:39.125 --> 01:50:40.083
Copy that!

1072
01:50:47.625 --> 01:50:48.833
Zhou Bin.

1073
01:50:48.917 --> 01:50:49.792
Boss.

1074
01:50:49.875 --> 01:50:51.458
We cannot blow up these artifacts.

1075
01:50:51.542 --> 01:50:53.917
My baby has just been born.
I don't want to go to prison--

1076
01:50:57.917 --> 01:50:58.792
Let me see.

1077
01:50:59.333 --> 01:51:01.042
- Gently.
- Press hard on it with your hand.

1078
01:51:01.792 --> 01:51:03.375
Luckily. there are no organs in the legs.

1079
01:51:07.083 --> 01:51:08.000
Herbert.

1080
01:51:08.083 --> 01:51:09.917
do you think
there is only a golden statue here?

1081
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.708
All of the Huns' treasures
are here too.

1082
01:51:11.792 --> 01:51:12.708
Where?

1083
01:51:12.792 --> 01:51:14.667
The answer is in the writing
on the wall outside.

1084
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:15.833
The writing on the wall?

1085
01:51:23.375 --> 01:51:24.417
You have my attention now.

1086
01:51:32.833 --> 01:51:33.708
Tell me.

1087
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:35.083
Xinran.

1088
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.167
Is Lei Zhen okay?

1089
01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:39.458
He is fine.

1090
01:51:39.542 --> 01:51:41.250
He only got shot twice.

1091
01:51:42.333 --> 01:51:43.333
Professor.

1092
01:51:43.958 --> 01:51:45.125
I'm waiting.

1093
01:51:46.083 --> 01:51:47.875
Let them go first. Then I'll tell you.

1094
01:51:49.083 --> 01:51:50.125
Why should I trust you?

1095
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:55.833
Okay.

1096
01:52:25.417 --> 01:52:27.667
Professor. give it up.

1097
01:52:29.958 --> 01:52:30.792
Right.

1098
01:52:30.875 --> 01:52:31.917
Let the gas out.

1099
01:53:09.667 --> 01:53:11.458
Don't hit me!

1100
01:54:15.292 --> 01:54:16.875
Stay away! Don't come any closer!

1101
01:54:35.208 --> 01:54:37.208
- Professor!
- Get them out of here! Call the police!

1102
01:54:37.292 --> 01:54:38.375
Okay!

1103
01:54:38.458 --> 01:54:39.458
Hurry!

1104
01:54:39.542 --> 01:54:40.750
- Xinran!
- Wang Jing!

1105
01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:45.208
Lei Zhen lost a lot of blood.
He needs medical help. I can't lift him.

1106
01:54:45.292 --> 01:54:46.125
- I'll help you.
- Okay.

1107
01:54:46.208 --> 01:54:47.375
No one can leave!

1108
01:54:51.958 --> 01:54:52.917
Wang Jing!

1109
01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:02.333
Why did you block the arrow for me?

1110
01:55:02.417 --> 01:55:03.917
I saw you were in danger.

1111
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:04.875
So I...

1112
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:06.833
Where does it hurt?

1113
01:55:07.417 --> 01:55:08.458
Where does it hurt?

1114
01:55:10.542 --> 01:55:11.917
Nowhere in particular.

1115
01:55:16.167 --> 01:55:17.208
My bag.

1116
01:55:17.292 --> 01:55:18.458
My leg!

1117
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:23.083
You bled so much.

1118
01:55:23.167 --> 01:55:24.625
- Are you okay?
- Why didn't you scream?

1119
01:55:24.708 --> 01:55:25.792
Call the police. Hurry.

1120
01:55:42.583 --> 01:55:43.417
Professor!

1121
01:56:26.417 --> 01:56:27.458
Are you okay?

1122
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.250
Professor.

1123
01:56:46.333 --> 01:56:48.042
no one can defy fate.

1124
01:56:52.042 --> 01:56:53.542
What is mine

1125
01:56:53.625 --> 01:56:55.083
shall be mine.

1126
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.125
Hang in there.

1127
01:58:20.333 --> 01:58:21.333
Here.

1128
01:58:21.417 --> 01:58:22.333
Drink some water.

1129
01:58:24.125 --> 01:58:25.583
Come on. let's head back.

1130
01:58:26.458 --> 01:58:27.625
It's so cold.

1131
01:58:29.333 --> 01:58:30.250
Are you cold?

1132
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:31.792
I think it's not that bad.

1133
01:58:38.125 --> 01:58:39.583
Here it comes.

1134
01:58:39.667 --> 01:58:41.542
Do you see?

1135
01:58:41.625 --> 01:58:43.750
Perseverance will pay off.

1136
01:58:43.833 --> 01:58:44.833
This fish is big.

1137
01:58:53.708 --> 01:58:54.792
It's a big fish.

1138
01:58:54.875 --> 01:58:56.167
- Keep going!
- Come on!

1139
01:59:00.708 --> 01:59:01.542
A big one!

1140
01:59:01.625 --> 01:59:03.333
It weighs at least 50 to 80 catties!

1141
01:59:19.417 --> 01:59:20.458
It got off my hook!

1142
01:59:20.542 --> 01:59:21.542
No. it didn't.

1143
01:59:22.375 --> 01:59:23.417
The fish is still here.

1144
01:59:25.625 --> 01:59:27.417
I've never seen fish lips like these.

1145
01:59:29.667 --> 01:59:31.417
Don't move. It has teeth.

1146
01:59:32.375 --> 01:59:33.625
Help...

1147
01:59:34.583 --> 01:59:36.083
It speaks human language?

1148
01:59:36.167 --> 01:59:37.250
Help!

1149
01:59:37.333 --> 01:59:38.583
I think it asked for help.

1150
01:59:39.958 --> 01:59:41.208
Help!

1151
01:59:41.292 --> 01:59:42.375
Pal. how did you get in?

1152
01:59:42.458 --> 01:59:43.708
Where are you swimming to?

1153
01:59:43.792 --> 01:59:45.667
- Why are you chatting with him?
- Get him out!

1154
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:47.083
Right!

1155
01:59:49.875 --> 01:59:51.917
Help!

1156
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:52.917
Come on. hurry up!

1157
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.083
- Hang in there!
- Hurry!

1158
01:59:58.708 --> 02:00:00.208
There is still no cell signal.

1159
02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:08.167
Xinran. if you're my girlfriend.
get Lei Zhen out of here now.

1160
02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:09.375
What about you?

1161
02:00:09.458 --> 02:00:10.792
I'll go find the professor.

1162
02:00:11.917 --> 02:00:13.792
- I can't leave him there by himself.
- Wang Jing!

1163
02:00:13.875 --> 02:00:15.625
We agreed to stick together!

1164
02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:16.542
Wang Jing!

1165
02:00:17.667 --> 02:00:18.583
Wang Jing!

1166
02:00:23.667 --> 02:00:25.375
Help!

1167
02:00:29.292 --> 02:00:31.417
Help!

1168
02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:34.875
Help!

1169
02:00:44.417 --> 02:00:46.083
- Hurry. get the quilt!
- Okay!

1170
02:00:46.167 --> 02:00:47.458
Quickly!

1171
02:00:56.208 --> 02:00:57.208
Over here. please.

1172
02:00:57.708 --> 02:00:59.042
Wang Jing. you're so handsome.

1173
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.542
Professor Fang. in your story A Legend.

1174
02:01:02.625 --> 02:01:04.458
the tragic romance echoes in one's heart.

1175
02:01:04.542 --> 02:01:05.667
It's simply splendid.

1176
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:06.833
I develop games.

1177
02:01:06.917 --> 02:01:09.417
Can I buy the game rights to your book?

1178
02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.292
We have already developed a game.

1179
02:01:11.375 --> 02:01:13.375
We need nothing but funding.

1180
02:01:13.458 --> 02:01:15.500
That's easy. I have money.

1181
02:01:15.583 --> 02:01:16.792
Wonderful!

1182
02:01:16.875 --> 02:01:17.750
Let's talk over there.

1183
02:01:17.833 --> 02:01:19.125
- Can you walk?
- I can.

1184
02:01:19.208 --> 02:01:20.167
- Good.
- Let's go.

1185
02:01:20.667 --> 02:01:21.750
Xinran. his book.

1186
02:01:21.833 --> 02:01:23.542
- Sir. your book!
- Professor Fang.

1187
02:01:23.625 --> 02:01:24.458
Hello.

1188
02:01:24.542 --> 02:01:25.958
Mr. Wang Jing.

1189
02:01:26.042 --> 02:01:29.500
the story of Zhao Zhan and Mengyun
has such a tragic ending.

1190
02:01:29.583 --> 02:01:31.000
It makes me so sad.

1191
02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:33.875
Actually. the professor
made another version of the ending.

1192
02:01:33.958 --> 02:01:35.792
Professor. take a look.

1193
02:01:43.708 --> 02:01:44.875
Professor Fang.

1194
02:01:44.958 --> 02:01:46.250
do you really

1195
02:01:46.333 --> 02:01:48.375
have a better ending?

1196
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.708
I have another ending.

1197
02:02:36.333 --> 02:02:38.208
Mengyun would rather sacrifice herself

1198
02:02:40.042 --> 02:02:41.333
to save your life.

1199
02:02:42.417 --> 02:02:44.375
I asked her before she died

1200
02:02:45.417 --> 02:02:47.000
why she insisted on doing that

1201
02:02:47.833 --> 02:02:50.125
knowing that you two
were not meant to be together.

1202
02:02:55.625 --> 02:02:58.042
On the day we first met.

1203
02:03:00.542 --> 02:03:02.292
he did not know me...

1204
02:03:04.833 --> 02:03:07.208
but he risked his life to protect me.

1205
02:03:10.083 --> 02:03:12.333
The general's sincere kindness...

1206
02:03:15.083 --> 02:03:17.167
is something that I will never forget.

1207
02:03:18.708 --> 02:03:20.875
If I can just help him

1208
02:03:20.958 --> 02:03:23.792
fulfill his wish to protect
the country and the people.

1209
02:03:25.292 --> 02:03:27.542
I will die with no regrets.

1210
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:08.000
The moon in the sky changes its appearance

1211
02:04:08.542 --> 02:04:14.250
The autumn leaves fall unnoticed

1212
02:04:15.375 --> 02:04:22.250
The time travel seems imaginary
And yet so real

1213
02:04:22.333 --> 02:04:29.250
And you are as happy as a good dream

1214
02:04:29.333 --> 02:04:35.625
The winter snow stumbles its way here

1215
02:04:36.208 --> 02:04:41.625
Fragmentary memories of many centuries

1216
02:04:42.833 --> 02:04:49.792
Devotion to become a part of you
Has turned into lovesickness

1217
02:04:49.875 --> 02:04:56.542
No one can separate you from me

1218
02:04:56.625 --> 02:05:03.542
This love is you. me.
the mountains. and the sea

1219
02:05:03.625 --> 02:05:10.292
It lasts to the present
And never falls apart

1220
02:05:10.375 --> 02:05:13.875
This love is you and me

1221
02:05:13.958 --> 02:05:19.458
My desire in this life

1222
02:05:19.542 --> 02:05:24.167
Is to give it all for you

1223
02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:27.375
{\an8}This love is what gives us something

1224
02:05:27.458 --> 02:05:33.125
{\an8}From nothing and our bond

1225
02:05:33.208 --> 02:05:38.375
{\an8}I will spend my life

1226
02:05:40.333 --> 02:05:46.417
{\an8}Waiting for you

1227
02:06:05.292 --> 02:06:08.833
{\an8}- Let love be the flower
- Let love be the flower

1228
02:06:08.917 --> 02:06:11.250
{\an8}- That blooms forever in our hearts
- That blooms forever in our hearts

1229
02:06:11.333 --> 02:06:14.875
{\an8}- Traveling through time and space
- Traveling through time and space

1230
02:06:14.958 --> 02:06:17.125
{\an8}- A dream we never bow down nor give up on
- A dream we never bow down nor give up on

1231
02:06:17.208 --> 02:06:20.875
{\an8}We loved each other so much

1232
02:06:20.958 --> 02:06:23.083
{\an8}That it hurt

1233
02:06:23.167 --> 02:06:26.833
{\an8}We couldn't even say I love you

1234
02:06:26.917 --> 02:06:29.250
{\an8}To each other

1235
02:06:29.333 --> 02:06:31.917
{\an8}Oh. baby. I just want a love

1236
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.375
{\an8}That will go endless forever

1237
02:06:35.458 --> 02:06:37.958
{\an8}Through the dreams that we found

1238
02:06:38.042 --> 02:06:41.542
{\an8}We won't give up never

1239
02:06:42.583 --> 02:06:45.292
{\an8}I. I can see you from my past life

1240
02:06:45.375 --> 02:06:47.958
{\an8}I. I see a star in the dark night

1241
02:06:48.042 --> 02:06:50.625
{\an8}Everybody has their own journey

1242
02:06:50.708 --> 02:06:53.375
{\an8}But everything about you feels right

1243
02:06:53.458 --> 02:06:56.958
{\an8}- Let love be the flower
- Let love be the flower

1244
02:06:57.042 --> 02:06:59.250
{\an8}- That blooms forever in our hearts
- That blooms forever in our hearts

1245
02:06:59.333 --> 02:07:02.875
{\an8}- Traveling through time and space
- Traveling through time and space

1246
02:07:02.958 --> 02:07:05.500
{\an8}- A dream we never bow down nor give up on
- A dream we never bow down nor give up on

1247
02:07:07.083 --> 02:07:09.500
{\an8}Memories in the shadows

1248
02:07:10.125 --> 02:07:12.333
{\an8}In a world so cold

1249
02:07:13.083 --> 02:07:15.250
{\an8}It's my heart I've got to follow

1250
02:07:16.042 --> 02:07:18.375
{\an8}I can't lose control

1251
02:07:20.583 --> 02:07:24.000
{\an8}I've got a broken heart
And it's split in two

1252
02:07:26.583 --> 02:07:30.000
{\an8}But there is not a moment I would undo

1253
02:07:30.083 --> 02:07:34.083
{\an8}I tell myself to let it go

1254
02:07:34.167 --> 02:07:36.083
{\an8}It's hard for me to let it go

1255
02:07:36.167 --> 02:07:39.958
{\an8}I feel things that I can't ignore

1256
02:07:40.042 --> 02:07:42.042
{\an8}It's hard for me to let it go

1257
02:07:42.125 --> 02:07:46.000
{\an8}I've been alone. but I will be fine

1258
02:07:47.833 --> 02:07:50.250
{\an8}The tears I shed won't wash away

1259
02:07:50.333 --> 02:07:53.250
{\an8}All the good times

1260
02:07:53.333 --> 02:07:56.833
{\an8}- Let love be the flower
- Let love be the flower
