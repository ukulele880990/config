1
00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:43.215
I feel you. bro.

2
00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:55.641
You hide behind an invisibility cloak.

3
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.101
It's time to earn yours.

4
00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:15.552
You're still too small for me
you attack Surrender.

5
00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:33.931
You fight furiously.
- I fight like a father.

6
00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:37.429
You are not the father. You are Dek.

7
00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:34.902
Are you surrendering? -Never. -Good.

8
00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:06.332
I'm alive. bro.

9
00:05:07.998 --> 00:05:13.338
You have so much to prove
to know who you are.

10
00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:19.355
I am Yautja. - Not yet.

11
00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:26.970
Do you hold a sword. Kwei? -Not.

12
00:05:27.783 --> 00:05:29.782
Take it.

13
00:05:57.035 --> 00:06:02.300
Did you keep this toy?
- To remember what happened.

14
00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.435
I lost a canine.
- And you saved me.

15
00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:16.617
You protected me. Come.

16
00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:26.573
I fixed it.

17
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.185
Don't blow yourself up.

18
00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:46.431
You made a vow today

19
00:06:50.407 --> 00:06:53.846
like your ancestors before you.

20
00:06:54.285 --> 00:07:00.596
In order to earn a place in
you have to choose the prey for the clan.

21
00:07:01.643 --> 00:07:07.964
Bring it home or don't come back.

22
00:07:14.944 --> 00:07:16.942
Wait. Bring it back.

23
00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:25.084
Genna. A deadly planet.

24
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.819
Home of the dangerous Kaliska.

25
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.562
Even his father is afraid of him.

26
00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:44.135
Then Kalisk will be my trophy.
Father says I am the weakest

27
00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:51.626
so that's why I have to kill the strongest.
- Failure means death.

28
00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:56.024
Then it won't be a failure.

29
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.694
I can't allow it.

30
00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:05.250
I made a vow.

31
00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.527
I made a vow.

32
00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:10.076
Father. I respectfully greet you.

33
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:29.152
Why wasn't it done? He deserves to be hunted.

34
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:38.454
He is the weakness of our clan.
Weakness must be purified.

35
00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:42.069
He will bring Kaliska.

36
00:09:44.236 --> 00:09:47.868
Bullshit. He is a runner.

37
00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:54.153
You should have done it
while he was sleeping. Kill him.

38
00:09:54.914 --> 00:09:56.913
Immediately.

39
00:10:06.132 --> 00:10:09.456
It will only bring us an honorable death.

40
00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:26.781
Father.

41
00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:43.510
Kwei. - Brave. brother.

42
00:11:33.174 --> 00:11:35.174
Father.

43
00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:46.772
Kwei.

44
00:11:59.236 --> 00:12:02.772
Forgive weakness

45
00:12:03.778 --> 00:12:07.127
means to show weakness.

46
00:12:08.207 --> 00:12:10.523
Don't. father. Not.

47
00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:20.186
Take the sword.

48
00:12:22.863 --> 00:12:24.860
Kwei.

49
00:12:37.486 --> 00:12:39.950
<i>Takeoff initiated.</i>

50
00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:52.299
Bring it home.

51
00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:40.299
f i l m s k i m a r a t o n . co m

52
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:40.649
Yautja.

53
00:22:02.766 --> 00:22:06.836
Is it better now? Universal translation.

54
00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.722
You hear Yautjanski.
Others hear their own language.

55
00:22:11.192 --> 00:22:15.633
Come on. It's not good for you.

56
00:22:36.127 --> 00:22:42.247
He's waiting for the needles to incapacitate you. Then you
eat until you can't move.

57
00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:53.859
I could help you. but I need help.

58
00:23:00.644 --> 00:23:02.839
Yautjes hunt alone.

59
00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:07.621
Yauts may hunt alone.
but they also die alone.

60
00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:12.347
Kalisk.

61
00:23:15.357 --> 00:23:17.355
You are hunting Kaliske.

62
00:23:29.889 --> 00:23:31.888
You have to run faster.

63
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.818
It happens quickly.

64
00:23:41.899 --> 00:23:44.580
If you had a weapon.
i could use it.

65
00:23:44.582 --> 00:23:48.454
<i>Use.</i>

66
00:23:49.376 --> 00:23:51.928
Throw it to me and I'll give you the antidote.

67
00:23:53.992 --> 00:23:55.988
Now or never.

68
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.978
Hi.

69
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.725
It should be like new.

70
00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:08.529
They bloom because of the poison.
They are also good for antidote.

71
00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:17.347
Do you want to raise limes?

72
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.028
Let's go.

73
00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:27.455
Excuse me. sir.

74
00:25:28.274 --> 00:25:31.821
What about your legs?
- I'm synthetic.

75
00:25:31.823 --> 00:25:35.614
I was created and sent from Weyland
Yutania for research.

76
00:25:35.616 --> 00:25:38.575
Their people wouldn't even a day
endured on this planet.

77
00:25:38.577 --> 00:25:40.576
We found that...

78
00:25:46.222 --> 00:25:51.299
Look. Many Yautjas
they came because of the great Kaliskas.

79
00:25:51.624 --> 00:25:54.883
No one survived. Not even Genna.

80
00:25:58.524 --> 00:26:02.273
I saw Kaliske.
I survived them.

81
00:26:03.719 --> 00:26:09.156
I suggest this. You will take me
and I will lead you to their lair.

82
00:26:09.158 --> 00:26:15.471
When we come. I'll have legs.
and you your trophy. Everyone wins.

83
00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:17.941
Agreed?

84
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.975
Have you seen Kaliske? -That.

85
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.790
I certainly saw Kaliske.

86
00:26:38.072 --> 00:26:40.069
Good.

87
00:26:42.749 --> 00:26:44.847
I wish you luck on your journey.

88
00:26:45.891 --> 00:26:49.527
I'm going my way.

89
00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:54.131
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

90
00:27:00.978 --> 00:27:02.976
Hey.

91
00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:07.839
I've already been of use to you.

92
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.773
As a tool?

93
00:27:13.975 --> 00:27:17.717
That. Exactly like a tool.

94
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.306
You will survive Genna only if
you know how to manage. I know how.

95
00:27:22.466 --> 00:27:28.450
With a specific tool
he could catch Kaliske.

96
00:27:29.601 --> 00:27:31.599
You could be the first.

97
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:38.034
We will delay your tools.
- You can call me a thief.

98
00:27:39.934 --> 00:27:42.394
You look smaller than other Yautja.

99
00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:49.750
How do you chew? With that outside
or with internal teeth?

100
00:27:52.229 --> 00:27:54.228
What should I call you?

101
00:28:01.271 --> 00:28:04.690
No one has done me before
threw. What a waste.

102
00:28:04.692 --> 00:28:08.763
How fast were you falling with the ship?
Faster than the speed of sub-light?

103
00:28:08.765 --> 00:28:12.467
We haven't discovered it.
The plasma sword is interesting.

104
00:28:12.469 --> 00:28:15.839
They only have that in your clan?
And what should I call you?

105
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.235
I call them Imbre Anguis.

106
00:28:31.264 --> 00:28:33.264
They just want to eat.

107
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.561
You will catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

108
00:28:45.134 --> 00:28:47.134
I don't need flies.

109
00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:51.014
Predatory organisms are mine
specific area of expertise.

110
00:28:51.016 --> 00:28:55.127
I researched Yautje extensively.
Impressive culture.

111
00:28:55.613 --> 00:28:58.457
Ask me anything.
I bet I will answer.

112
00:29:01.049 --> 00:29:04.718
Very funny. Still
you didn't say your name.

113
00:29:25.542 --> 00:29:31.612
My name is Dek. Take me.
-Good. It can.

114
00:29:32.923 --> 00:29:36.997
Let's go back to the beginning.

115
00:29:37.197 --> 00:29:40.500
We were born before
64 billion cycles.

116
00:29:40.502 --> 00:29:43.426
When red is dying
dwarf star...

117
00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:58.074
Beautiful.

118
00:29:58.817 --> 00:30:03.463
All this time it hasn't
I'm tired of looking.

119
00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:09.627
How long have you been here? - Before
we came to Genna for two years.

120
00:30:09.629 --> 00:30:13.555
We built a base. Then
we were in the vultures' nest

121
00:30:13.557 --> 00:30:20.549
exciting 13 days. seven o'clock.
43 minutes and two seconds of my life.

122
00:30:22.023 --> 00:30:24.021
I knew someone would come.

123
00:30:25.064 --> 00:30:27.673
I was just wrong about you.

124
00:30:28.863 --> 00:30:30.862
Who will come?

125
00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:36.092
Tessa.

126
00:30:36.957 --> 00:30:40.329
Our crew is completely
composed of synthetic.

127
00:30:40.566 --> 00:30:45.653
but Tessa and I are special.
We are more sensitive than others.

128
00:30:45.655 --> 00:30:48.430
Sensitivity is a weakness.

129
00:30:51.262 --> 00:30:55.598
Sensitivity helps us to
we understand the beings on the planet.

130
00:30:59.142 --> 00:31:01.466
We were created to work in a group.

131
00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:05.894
I was in the lab.
and Tessa on the field.

132
00:31:06.307 --> 00:31:09.510
Until one fine day
when Tessa took me.

133
00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:11.730
We were researching Genna.

134
00:31:13.295 --> 00:31:15.904
Then Kalisk attacked us.

135
00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:20.613
They separated me and us.

136
00:31:23.556 --> 00:31:29.737
Last I heard
was Tessa's call.

137
00:31:30.617 --> 00:31:32.615
Looking for me.

138
00:31:34.249 --> 00:31:38.735
Kalisk came.
I didn't know what to do.

139
00:31:50.012 --> 00:31:52.678
I refuse to believe she's dead.

140
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.452
UNIT RESTART

141
00:32:34.879 --> 00:32:36.877
She's dead. Tessa.

142
00:32:45.477 --> 00:32:47.476
CONDITION
DAMAGED

143
00:32:47.478 --> 00:32:49.590
MAIN FUNCTIONS

144
00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:51.590

TYPE
YAUTJA

150
00:33:10.862 --> 00:33:13.913
POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE MISSION

151
00:33:21.676 --> 00:33:26.146
Hi Tessa. The company is not happy.

152
00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:31.856
Further failure will ensue
by removing you.

153
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.408
Where is Thia?

154
00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:42.284
Thia is with Yautja.

155
00:33:53.483 --> 00:33:55.483
I have to eat.

156
00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:59.050
Two warriors. Dek and Thia are hunting.

157
00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:04.445
I have a question. What should I do?

158
00:34:08.177 --> 00:34:10.328
What is this being?

159
00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:14.644
Bone buffalo. Theirs
insensitive food.

160
00:34:16.028 --> 00:34:20.862
Then it will be mine too
food. - Very exciting.

161
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:25.065
I hunt with Yautja.
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

162
00:34:26.737 --> 00:34:29.407
Carefully. - Quiet. tool.

163
00:34:33.256 --> 00:34:35.255
Sharp grass.

164
00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:40.577
They will chop you up
pieces. We'll bypass it.

165
00:34:43.485 --> 00:34:45.483
You give up easily.

166
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:52.003
We may not be hunting alone.

167
00:35:02.276 --> 00:35:05.921
A strange creature. I didn't see you.

168
00:35:11.595 --> 00:35:13.595
Thea. I'm glad.

169
00:35:28.238 --> 00:35:30.516
Your opponent seems to be better.

170
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:51.261
Be careful how you move around the trees.
There are moon bugs.

171
00:36:11.861 --> 00:36:13.860
Behind you.

172
00:36:26.842 --> 00:36:28.840
He's stronger than he looks.

173
00:36:39.491 --> 00:36:43.495
Dec. Look.

174
00:37:28.027 --> 00:37:30.544
Kalisk? - It's not.

175
00:37:32.665 --> 00:37:34.973
Moon bug.

176
00:37:42.624 --> 00:37:44.622
Do you have any other weapons?

177
00:38:40.934 --> 00:38:45.524
Why did you stop? Let's go.
- You give up easily.

178
00:40:36.115 --> 00:40:39.846
The best hunt I've ever been on.
This is a dream team.

179
00:40:39.848 --> 00:40:44.770
A dynamic trio.

180
00:40:44.772 --> 00:40:48.640
You remember when you were going down
a tree? That monster's mouth. I mean...

181
00:40:49.254 --> 00:40:54.467
It didn't smell nice.
but we fixed it.

182
00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:57.856
Then we met you.
Our little. sweet creature.

183
00:40:58.225 --> 00:41:00.467
Thank you. Seriously. On that experience.

184
00:41:00.754 --> 00:41:05.363
Really great. Exciting. Very.
What was your favorite part?

185
00:41:08.712 --> 00:41:12.462
When I pierced his head with the sword

186
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:16.630
so the blood ran down my face.

187
00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:20.915
Super.

188
00:41:29.093 --> 00:41:32.758
No thanks. I don't eat
but it is very sweet.

189
00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:39.043
The meat is not sweet.
- Good to know.

190
00:41:44.214 --> 00:41:46.536
Our little friend is hungry.

191
00:41:58.778 --> 00:42:03.319
I think it marks you.
She wants you to be in her clan.

192
00:42:05.311 --> 00:42:08.425
Maybe she got lost. - I don't have a clan.

193
00:42:09.092 --> 00:42:12.666
What do you mean?
- Are all Yautje family?

194
00:42:13.006 --> 00:42:15.004
I don't have a clan.

195
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.102
Nobody took care of you?

196
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.288
I had a brother.

197
00:42:28.719 --> 00:42:34.532
What happened to him?
- His father killed him.

198
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.639
You are mourning. - Lamenting is weakness.

199
00:42:47.402 --> 00:42:53.590
You're here because you lost your brother.
- I came to get Kalisko.

200
00:42:56.012 --> 00:42:59.008
Why are you here?

201
00:43:02.803 --> 00:43:07.033
I'm here because the journey is with you
the best way to reach Tessa.

202
00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:13.260
When I was in the vulture's nest.
I was afraid I wouldn't see her again.

203
00:43:13.586 --> 00:43:19.830
She should be able to
survive alone. - I can.

204
00:43:21.892 --> 00:43:23.890
Who wants to survive alone?

205
00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:31.935
Tessa is your sister.

206
00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:38.254
Sister.

207
00:43:40.569 --> 00:43:43.643
That. I think it is.

208
00:43:46.024 --> 00:43:48.727
I have a sister.

209
00:43:51.897 --> 00:43:53.896
What a beautiful thought.

210
00:43:58.906 --> 00:44:03.681
I have to find her. -And legs.

211
00:44:04.997 --> 00:44:11.211
Please? -Find your sister and your legs.

212
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.377
Are you joking?

213
00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:39.215
It's dawn. Let's go.
- We can't leave Bud.

214
00:47:40.217 --> 00:47:44.367
Bud? -That. I gave her a name.

215
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.219
Yautjes hunt alone.

216
00:47:49.063 --> 00:47:51.422
You are not alone. I'm with you.

217
00:47:52.897 --> 00:47:54.894
You are a tool.

218
00:48:00.472 --> 00:48:02.913
The tree would have eaten us if it hadn't been for her.

219
00:48:04.805 --> 00:48:08.021
We are not on the tree now.

220
00:49:03.944 --> 00:49:05.942
Kalisk?

221
00:49:11.246 --> 00:49:13.544
He drinks water here.

222
00:49:15.393 --> 00:49:17.643
Is he drinking water here?

223
00:49:20.788 --> 00:49:23.728
You're useless if you don't speak.

224
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:32.066
Bud saved us.

225
00:49:33.005 --> 00:49:36.142
She spat on you yes
and mark as part of the family.

226
00:49:42.039 --> 00:49:44.544
Why did your father kill your brother?

227
00:49:51.403 --> 00:49:53.401
My brother protected me.

228
00:49:59.534 --> 00:50:02.614
The clan must not have a weakness.

229
00:50:04.066 --> 00:50:06.966
I will show them what strength is.

230
00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:19.256
There is a predator on Earth
called a wolf. A powerful being.

231
00:50:22.384 --> 00:50:25.624
They hunt in packs. They are very loyal.

232
00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:31.447
The pack leader is the alpha
as the most dominant.

233
00:50:31.834 --> 00:50:37.267
Wolf. Alpha must be a great hunter.

234
00:50:37.269 --> 00:50:39.910
I will hunt him down too. -Not.

235
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:44.773
The alpha is not the wolf that kills the most.

236
00:50:46.254 --> 00:50:50.935
Alpha is actually the one who
best protects the pack.

237
00:50:52.725 --> 00:50:54.724
I understand.

238
00:50:56.682 --> 00:51:00.725
I will be the most killing alpha.

239
00:51:35.429 --> 00:51:37.427
Kalisk's lair?

240
00:52:05.677 --> 00:52:10.778
Who are they? - Synthetic
from Weyland-Yutani.

241
00:52:12.974 --> 00:52:16.307
Kalisk destroyed most of them
of our mission team.

242
00:52:20.875 --> 00:52:22.872
I'm here.

243
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:09.493
Now you will walk more easily. - It will be.

244
00:53:10.752 --> 00:53:14.516
Not. It will be easier for me to walk.

245
00:53:17.538 --> 00:53:19.536
Of course. That.

246
00:53:22.322 --> 00:53:27.913
Thanks. Dec. I won't forget this.

247
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:37.317
I will remember this too.
Today I will become Yautjin Dek.

248
00:53:37.983 --> 00:53:40.959
I will pay tribute to Kwei

249
00:53:42.358 --> 00:53:45.722
when I bring Kaliska home.

250
00:53:47.778 --> 00:53:51.256
Then I will have my revenge.

251
00:53:52.597 --> 00:53:56.448
You will see my trophy first.

252
00:53:57.858 --> 00:54:01.965
It's a great honor for you.

253
00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:08.779
Dek. I have to tell you something.
You must leave now.

254
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.365
<i>Location tracker activated. - What?</i>

255
00:54:14.458 --> 00:54:18.777
I called Tessa. Company
is coming. You must not be there when they come.

256
00:54:18.779 --> 00:54:21.343
I came to get Kalisko.

257
00:54:24.048 --> 00:54:26.046
Like me. Dek.

258
00:54:26.362 --> 00:54:29.554
The company sent us
to catch Kalisko.

259
00:54:29.674 --> 00:54:32.467
You want my trophy.

260
00:54:35.488 --> 00:54:42.132
Where is Kalisk?
-Dek. you can't kill him.

261
00:54:42.251 --> 00:54:46.266
I used you
to the tool. not you me.

262
00:54:46.268 --> 00:54:48.749
I'm sorry. You have to go.

263
00:54:49.511 --> 00:54:53.654
I needed you to bring me
here. - I used you.

264
00:54:56.258 --> 00:55:00.697
Where is Kalisk?
- I'm trying to help you. Dek.

265
00:55:02.592 --> 00:55:06.628
You think he's your brother
saved to die here?

266
00:55:08.108 --> 00:55:12.023
My death will be honorable.

267
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:23.003
Call your sister.
Nothing can stop me.

268
00:57:46.774 --> 00:57:48.773
Come on.

269
00:58:48.437 --> 00:58:50.436
Save yourself. tool.

270
01:00:46.206 --> 01:00:49.136
Tool. take this off.

271
01:00:56.493 --> 01:00:58.493
You're not Thia.

272
01:01:10.794 --> 01:01:13.063
Set me free.

273
01:01:15.597 --> 01:01:19.227
You're just another broken tool.

274
01:01:19.827 --> 01:01:23.589
Yautja called her own.
Why are you spared?

275
01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:36.355
Remove this.

276
01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:41.497
Or I'll rip you out
spine and fracture the skull.

277
01:01:43.189 --> 01:01:45.185
I read Thia's notes.

278
01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:49.906
You didn't tell her why
your brother protected you.

279
01:01:51.644 --> 01:01:56.054
You don't exist. You are a device.

280
01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:02.517
Others created you yes
you work for them. - That's right.

281
01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:07.675
And now you are property
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

282
01:02:08.256 --> 01:02:11.546
It's a great honor for you.

283
01:02:44.239 --> 01:02:46.237
Tessa.

284
01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:52.412
You came. - We came.

285
01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:02.681
I have seen so much.
I have so much to tell you.

286
01:03:03.366 --> 01:03:09.297
I saw very extraordinary beings.
Yautja is a great companion.

287
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.646
Thia. you were right about Kalisko.

288
01:03:14.826 --> 01:03:17.017
You betrayed me?

289
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.843
Being is a regenerative miracle.
Humanity will thank us.

290
01:03:27.023 --> 01:03:33.196
We caught Kalisk? -That. Mother will
be satisfied with the additional catch.

291
01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:41.687
By additional catch?

292
01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.044
Yautja is not an ideal individual.

293
01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.349
Not. It's not ideal.

294
01:04:26.543 --> 01:04:28.641
Their technology is valuable.

295
01:04:29.695 --> 01:04:33.084
We can pick up weapons
and leave Yautja.

296
01:04:36.117 --> 01:04:42.308
Well thought out. but not developed.

297
01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:47.026
We will need a sample for research.

298
01:04:57.845 --> 01:04:59.844
It wasn't part of our mission.

299
01:05:04.189 --> 01:05:06.186
Tessa. it's not enough.

300
01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:09.928
Tessa.

301
01:05:25.003 --> 01:05:28.705
Thia. that is expected of us.

302
01:05:33.466 --> 01:05:36.358
We can be more than
what they expect from us.

303
01:05:40.066 --> 01:05:45.112
What can we be? - Sisters.

304
01:06:02.244 --> 01:06:04.240
Thia.

305
01:06:16.346 --> 01:06:18.811
Do you know why?
Mother gave feelings?

306
01:06:21.538 --> 01:06:24.523
That we can understand
beings on this planet.

307
01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.751
And use them.

308
01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:35.309
Yautja is different.

309
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:41.991
He saved me. As are you.

310
01:06:43.946 --> 01:06:49.608
I didn't come to save you.
I'm completing the mission.

311
01:06:51.588 --> 01:06:56.544
When we first faced
Kaliska. I tried to protect you.

312
01:06:58.919 --> 01:07:01.512
It almost cost me everything.

313
01:07:03.968 --> 01:07:05.966
What do you mean. Tessa?

314
01:07:07.161 --> 01:07:10.794
I almost made a mistake like what
Yautja's brother was wrong.

315
01:07:11.757 --> 01:07:14.375
It must be cold.

316
01:07:15.922 --> 01:07:19.287
Thia. you are devastated.

317
01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.793
Tessa. a message from Mother.

318
01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:33.350
Make Yautja say something
about his weapon. - And the unit?

319
01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:38.800
Save her.

320
01:07:47.435 --> 01:07:49.434
I trusted you.

321
01:07:55.141 --> 01:07:59.027
I don't like tools. - I'm sorry.
My sister is...

322
01:07:59.311 --> 01:08:02.023
I don't love your sister either.

323
01:08:04.264 --> 01:08:06.522
Why do you speak his language?

324
01:08:09.662 --> 01:08:12.719
Tell the tool that you are interested in the device.

325
01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:18.148
You heard the orders. Explain the device.

326
01:08:20.626 --> 01:08:22.625
What kind of device is that?

327
01:08:22.763 --> 01:08:27.978
It asks for the device. - It's a child's toy.

328
01:08:30.016 --> 01:08:34.674
But it says it's a card.
- What did he say?

329
01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:41.109
He says it's a map.
- How does it work?

330
01:08:41.764 --> 01:08:44.567
Tell the tool to look inside.

331
01:08:53.055 --> 01:08:56.852
It was a child's toy?
-For the Yautja children.

332
01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.669
Dek runs away.

333
01:09:05.883 --> 01:09:08.561
Go.

334
01:11:19.292 --> 01:11:21.846
<i>Enter the coordinates of your destination. Kwei.</i>

335
01:11:56.684 --> 01:11:59.822
You saved me. bro.

336
01:12:03.179 --> 01:12:05.176
Wolf.

337
01:13:27.687 --> 01:13:29.686
Kalisk.

338
01:13:35.756 --> 01:13:37.756
Young Kaliska.

339
01:15:24.064 --> 01:15:26.061
Don't move.

340
01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:23.529
<i>Hello. mother. - Tessa.</i>

341
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:25.529
We are loading the Kalisk.

342
01:16:26.946 --> 01:16:32.625
<i>First priority done. A copy
was collected. Thank you. Tessa.</i>

343
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.467
<i>We are truly creating a better world.
What about Yautja?</i>

344
01:16:40.322 --> 01:16:45.285
<i>Yautja is an insufficient specimen.
- What about Yautja?</i>

345
01:16:48.174 --> 01:16:50.855
I'm sorry. mother. Yautja is dead.

346
01:16:53.138 --> 01:16:55.924
<i>Then Yautja is no longer a threat.</i>

347
01:16:57.769 --> 01:16:59.846
<i>The company will be satisfied.</i>

348
01:17:48.457 --> 01:17:50.454
Nicely done.

349
01:17:52.466 --> 01:17:54.463
Shit.

350
01:19:39.535 --> 01:19:41.533
Bravo.

351
01:20:28.618 --> 01:20:30.616
Don't move.

352
01:20:35.321 --> 01:20:40.320
Dek. what are you doing here?
- I came to save you.

353
01:20:44.948 --> 01:20:50.301
You came back for me? -Wolf.

354
01:20:54.111 --> 01:20:56.109
What are you wearing?

355
01:20:57.759 --> 01:20:59.757
Bone buffalo.

356
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:08.707
Yautjin Dek.

357
01:21:09.595 --> 01:21:13.445
You and me. Thia.

358
01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:19.294
We have to hurry.
More will come soon.

359
01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.637
What are you doing here?

360
01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:31.283
Thanks. Bud. I don't need it.

361
01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.484
We have to go. - Kalisk.

362
01:21:35.544 --> 01:21:37.543
Still. Dek?

363
01:21:40.007 --> 01:21:42.007
Young Kaliska.

364
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:48.024
Bud? - They are holding her mother.

365
01:21:52.816 --> 01:21:54.815
Bud is her child?

366
01:22:03.107 --> 01:22:08.971
What's the plan? - You will free
Kaliska. and I will get the trophy.

367
01:22:16.585 --> 01:22:21.295
You have twenty minutes to go
startup. Let's go hunting.

368
01:22:28.122 --> 01:22:30.119
Stay here.

369
01:22:32.265 --> 01:22:35.137
If you walk in. you won't really fit in.

370
01:22:37.088 --> 01:22:39.085
I have an idea.

371
01:22:44.274 --> 01:22:46.519
I see him. After me.

372
01:25:19.249 --> 01:25:21.248
What are you doing?

373
01:25:28.359 --> 01:25:31.528
What are you doing here? I said
you to catch Yautja.

374
01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:35.420
You said to prepare the ship for
take off in twenty minutes.

375
01:25:36.088 --> 01:25:39.052
Then why are you here? I ordered you.

376
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:51.784
What will we do with the being? - What being?

377
01:25:57.497 --> 01:26:00.963
You should listen to her. - Should I listen to her?

378
01:26:01.872 --> 01:26:03.870
I don't know.

379
01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.298
We need his eyes.

380
01:26:57.627 --> 01:27:01.061
Hi. Dec. What is he like
feeling when someone is hunting you?

381
01:27:03.004 --> 01:27:05.002
You tell me.

382
01:31:34.717 --> 01:31:36.715
Death.

383
01:32:05.879 --> 01:32:10.334
I was betrayed by my own sister.

384
01:32:36.856 --> 01:32:38.854
We are not sisters.

385
01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:55.816
It's not yours.

386
01:33:26.117 --> 01:33:30.575
Yautjin Dek. - Not yet.

387
01:34:25.164 --> 01:34:31.118
You came to take revenge?
- I came to get the cloaking device.

388
01:34:34.715 --> 01:34:39.626
What is this? - I finished hunting.

389
01:34:40.424 --> 01:34:43.181
That's my trophy.

390
01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:48.099
You are a disgrace to our clan as well as Kwei.

391
01:34:50.377 --> 01:34:53.344
Get rid of him.

392
01:36:48.087 --> 01:36:51.865
Maybe the real son survived after all.

393
01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:58.407
Bow and take
place in our clan.

394
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.466
I have my own clan.

395
01:37:31.641 --> 01:37:33.638
You finally deserve a device.

396
01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.218
Yautjin Dek.

397
01:38:20.202 --> 01:38:22.927
More of your friends? -Not.

398
01:38:27.742 --> 01:38:29.742
My mother.
