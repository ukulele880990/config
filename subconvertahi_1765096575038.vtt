2
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.480
Looking fabulous. my lovelies.

3
00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.460
Today is Monday. August 11.

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.856
and it is going
to be a great day

5
00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.560
if we choose
to make the most of it.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.299
-Alicia.
-It's humid outside.

7
00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.160
but there's plenty
of bright sunshine.

8
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.460
And it doesn't matter
if you are rich or poor.

9
00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.619
-Sunshine is free for everyone.
-Alicia!

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.000
I get what you're doing.
I did it. too.

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.479
But these patients?
They're in the garden.

12
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.679
They got planted here whenever.
and they'll never go anywhere.

13
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.796
You can give 'em
all the love you like.

14
00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.799
but you've only got so much
of that to go around.

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.696
Hmm.

16
00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:49.789
Are you a plant. Lewis?

17
00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.589
Hey. have you seen this?

18
00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.206
He responded to me.
I don't know. He...

19
00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.729
He winked or something.

20
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.807
It's not like
what you see in the movies.

21
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.688
These patients...
their brainstems are intact.

22
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.289
Their eyes move.
their bodies twitch.

23
00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.206
I wanted it
to mean something. too.

24
00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.710
But you'll see.
It's just random.

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.060
Morning. Watson.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140
Sherlock.

27
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.317
you're gonna get yourself killed
sneaking around like this.

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.480
Wouldn't be the first time.

29
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
Nice to see you. John.

30
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.439
You're looking a bit ripped.
has to be said.

31
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.017
Man of your age.
What's the story there?

32
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.100
I exercise.

33
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.980
Well. so do I.
Jumping jacks this very day.

34
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.180
I'll wait for my six-pack
to arrive by post.

35
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.480
That's mostly a diet thing.

36
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.020
Anyway.
it's good to see you here.

37
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Nice city you have here.

38
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.280
Sense of its own history.

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.240
Commendable lack of pretension.

40
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.377
I'll look forward
to spending some time.

41
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.500
-You're staying here in Pittsburgh?
-A week. maybe.

42
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.260
I have some digging to do. some
time to spend with a friend.

43
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.800
All right. well. sounds good.

44
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540
What are we digging into?

45
00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.960
Well. how about breakfast.
for a start?

46
00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.347
-Toad in the hole.
-No. no.

47
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.310
I'm not eating anything called
"toad in a hole."

48
00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.609
Open your mind. Watson.
Sausage. Yorkshire pudding.

49
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.829
I have a talk
to give this morning.

50
00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.810
and this looks like
it might mess with my stomach.

51
00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.099
No. no. absolutely not.

52
00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.959
That's a fabrication by press.

53
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.419
There is no crisis
at Diogenes Technologies.

54
00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.199
We continue to innovate
in the field of biotechnology.

55
00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.536
Reports
to the contrary don't come

56
00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.560
from so-called whistleblowers.

57
00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.820
but rather
disgruntled former employees.

58
00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:48.319
My brother cuts a fine line
of bollocks.

59
00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.239
I'm not sure he's selling it.

60
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.919
-Do you believe him?
-Should I believe him?

61
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500
What do you know?

62
00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.839
It's a risky thing.

63
00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.759
holding stock
in a major corporation.

64
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.839
See. that sounds like
you definitely know something.

65
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.720
I know the man's wearing
too much makeup.

66
00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.579
No one believes
you got a tan. Mycroft.

67
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.637
Are you staying here
while you're in town?

68
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
I hate to intrude.

69
00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.137
-but it would help me keep a low profile.
-Come on. Holmes.

70
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.740
I stayed with you
for months at a time.

71
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.256
Make yourself at home.
Let me ask you.

72
00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.459
I know you say
you barely spoke to Mycroft.

73
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.739
but are you really rooting
for his company to fail?

74
00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:20.939
It's just brother stuff.

75
00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.359
Shakespeare told that story
better than I ever could.

76
00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.039
You've got a talk to give. Eat.

77
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.790
I'm suspicious.

78
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.107
Well.
what are you suspicious of?

79
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.907
You just said
things were going really well.

80
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.477
I'm suspicious of exactly that.

81
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.287
The little tricks
you tell us to do in here.

82
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.747
The pauses. the questions

83
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.010
we're supposed to ask ourselves
before we act.

84
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.890
Right now. they're working.

85
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.087
We're getting work done
at the clinic.

86
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.550
I'm getting along with everyone.

87
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.467
We're even going
to see Watson give grand rounds

88
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.866
at Van Kirk Memorial
this morning.

89
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.210
Like. as a group. a team.

90
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.047
Well. that all sounds
really positive.

91
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.707
Is there another word
you could use

92
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.730
to describe
what you've been feeling?

93
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.850
I'm happy.

94
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.670
I've been happy.

95
00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.044
Beck?

96
00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:14.388
Yeah. Sorry.

97
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.629
I've been holding that in
for a minute.

98
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.367
Look. everyone here is good
at putting on a mask.

99
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.487
That's what we do all day.
every day.

100
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.409
Ingrid is normally really good
at it.

101
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.967
I mean. I'm taking notes.

102
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.370
I'm sure the whole group is.

103
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.127
But that right there

104
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.826
was a dog's balls impression
of a happy person.

105
00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:33.909
One out of ten.

106
00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.870
What do you say
we take Ingrid at her word?

107
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.029
Good luck with that.

108
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.019
I've been
where you are right now.

109
00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:46.456
Somehow I doubt that.

110
00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.186
Yeah. I've been broke.
then rich.

111
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.478
Then broke. then rich again.
I mean. I could keep going.

112
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.809
It's a cycle
that I'm trying to break.

113
00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.507
Hence all the
what-have-you here.

114
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:55.673
You know. eventually.
I'll build up a big enough pile

115
00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:57.440
and think
everything is going to be great.

116
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.820
but instead. I get hung up
on this empty feeling.

117
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.980
"What do you want.
after you get what you want?"

118
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.100
Tricky place to be in.

119
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.087
People are going to experiment

120
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.990
on their own genomes
with CRISPR.

121
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.550
It's just a given.

122
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.170
I correspond
with these folks freely.

123
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.030
and I'm going
to continue to do that.

124
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.189
It's not an endorsement.

125
00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.069
I just don't see the angle
in shunning them.

126
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.930
Thank you.

127
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.780
Does anyone have any questions
for Dr. Watson?

128
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500
Yes.

129
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.840
Uh. thank you for coming
to our hospital. Dr. Watson.

130
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.260
I've read about your clinic.

131
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.300
It's. uh...
it's not just genetics. right?

132
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.780
You handle
the hardest situations?

133
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
We do our best.

134
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.439
We have a patient here.
Lewis Collier.

135
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.900
He's in a persistent
vegetative state.

136
00:05:48.988 --> 00:05:51.451
-Alicia. we've been over this.
-Sorry. Dr. Watson.

137
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.620
I swear he responds to me.

138
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.980
Nurse Santos.

139
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.240
Dr. Watson's here
to give grand rounds.

140
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.780
This is a discussion
about CRISPR technology.

141
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.540
Does anyone have a question
on the topic?

142
00:06:04.224 --> 00:06:05.788
-Great panel. Dr. Watson.
-Thank you.

143
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.309
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

144
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.390
Excuse me?

145
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.110
Nurse Santos. right?

146
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.670
Tell me.

147
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.627
I asked Lewis to blink twice

148
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.507
if he can understand me.

149
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.507
A few times. there was nothing.

150
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.150
but a few times.
I'm pretty sure he did.

151
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.686
How long has Lewis
been a patient here?

152
00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.610
Since 2010. He had a stroke.

153
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.487
His wife didn't find him
until a day later

154
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.770
when she got back from a trip.

155
00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.109
Have you talked
to his family about this?

156
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.129
The staff says that he hasn't
had a visitor in about a decade.

157
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.867
Look. I am not a troublemaker.

158
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.607
and I am not trying
to be annoying.

159
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.310
But what if he is in there?

160
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.307
What if he's just been
trapped inside himself

161
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.390
this entire time?

162
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.366
If a person
with locked-in syndrome was

163
00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.730
to slip through the cracks.
this is how it would happen.

164
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.370
A stroke.
no treatment for a day.

165
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.570
His initial EEG was abnormal.
and they never tested it again.

166
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.527
We need to come up with a test

167
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.730
to determine
if Lewis's movements are random.

168
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.147
What can you tell me about him?

169
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.350
Looks like his wife died
a few years after his stroke.

170
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.130
But also. Watson. a test?

171
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.350
We don't work here.

172
00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.407
Well. we're not working.
We're doing a test.

173
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.370
I found a blog he used to write.

174
00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.629
Looks like
Lucky was a civil engineer.

175
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.649
-Lucky?
-That's how he signed the entries.

176
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.826
The whole thing is about

177
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.350
the history of bridges
in Pittsburgh.

178
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.950
It's actually
really interesting.

179
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.079
-I said. this is interesting.
-Yeah. we heard you.

180
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.420
Good morning. Lucky.

181
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.230
I'm going to ask
you a question if that's okay.

182
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.127
It's something
that we know you can answer.

183
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.510
so if you do.
we'll know you're in there.

184
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.287
In 2006. there was a bridge here
in the city that was renamed

185
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.910
after environmentalist
Rachel Carson.

186
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.367
Can you tell me what street

187
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.670
the Rachel Carson Bridge
was named after?

188
00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:05.949
That's two.

189
00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:10.914
Three.

190
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.550
Four.

191
00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:16.970
He stopped on four.

192
00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:20.870
The Fourth Street Bridge.
Exactly.

193
00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:23.049
It's nice to meet you. Lucky.

194
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.810
My name is John Watson.

195
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.470
If you'll let me.
I want to be your doctor.

196
00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.879
We want to hear your story.
Lucky.

197
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.600
When I get to the column that
has the letter you want. blink.

198
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.559
and then I'll run my finger
along that row. okay?

199
00:08:57.672 --> 00:08:59.189
"I."

200
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120
Okay. good.

201
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280
Next letter.

202
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.920
Lucky's wife was the only
one who talked to him for years.

203
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.820
One day. a couple of years
after his stroke.

204
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.659
he noticed
that she was losing weight.

205
00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:18.196
I want to do
something worthy of...

206
00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.139
And then she had dark
circles under her eyes.

207
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.640
And then one day...

208
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.680
she was gone.

209
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.360
Nobody even thought
to tell Lucky what had happened.

210
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.260
That was it.

211
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.180
He spent years
watching his world go by.

212
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.140
My God.

213
00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:39.720
We're gonna transfer Lucky
to UHOP.

214
00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:43.120
I mean. too many bad memories
at Van Kirk Memorial.

215
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.740
He needs a fresh start.

216
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.280
Of course. I'll make calls.

217
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.920
What do we do for him
once he's here?

218
00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.220
What can we do for him
once he's here?

219
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.139
We need to redefine the idea
of a win.

220
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.817
Lucky's never going to walk.

221
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.940
He's never going to talk.

222
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.060
But he still deserves
a meaningful life.

223
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.497
So what does that look like?

224
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.700
Lucky can feel the stiffness
in his muscles.

225
00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:04.777
We can treat the spasticity
with a baclofen pump.

226
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.399
It's exhausting to communicate
using those boards.

227
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.537
Patients with locked-in syndrome
report pain

228
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.417
from the effort of having
to keep their eyes open

229
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.720
until it's time to blink.

230
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.000
I had a neuro professor at Pitt
that retired early.

231
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.317
He founded a company

232
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.917
to make a better
brain-computer interface

233
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.140
for patients like this.

234
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.620
If we can get Lucky
into a trial for the tech.

235
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.836
he'll be able to control
a computer just by thinking.

236
00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.897
Perfect.

237
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.460
See if you can get a meeting
with him.

238
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.236
"I wanna tell you a joke

239
00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:32.460
"about someone
who only eats plants.

240
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.299
You've never heard
of herbivore."

241
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.637
Yeah. That.

242
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.759
Lucky is a remarkable man.

243
00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.240
A true testament to
the human spirit in many ways.

244
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.580
He also likes puns.

245
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.840
"Did you know they won't be
making yardsticks any longer?"

246
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.100
He's a hero.

247
00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.980
He also has
a terrible sense of humor.

248
00:10:57.696 --> 00:10:59.906
Sherlock?

249
00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:05.343
Holmes?

250
00:11:17.373 --> 00:11:19.056
"Wield me"?

251
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.282
Allez. Watson!

252
00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:25.967
Ha!

253
00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:30.934
Not bad. my friend.

254
00:11:31.017 --> 00:11:32.407
You've kept up
with your single stick?

255
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.490
No. I'm just athletic.

256
00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:35.446
You have any idea
why your brother's calling me?

257
00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:36.529
Did you answer?

258
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:42.449
Why is he calling me?

259
00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:44.589
I suspect he wants to know
if you've heard from me.

260
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.299
The world thinks
you've been dead for a year.

261
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.600
Why would he want to know that?

262
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.117
Of course
you know I'm an amateur chemist.

263
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.720
amongst other things.

264
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.420
Mycroft founded
Diogenes Technologies

265
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.500
based on something
that came out of my lab.

266
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.180
He cut me in. just enough
so he didn't quite steal it.

267
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.480
But when I died... "died"...

268
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.060
most of what I had went
to various causes.

269
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.220
including your clinic.

270
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.059
To my brother.
I left a new chemical formula.

271
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.320
I explained that
as a... a final gift.

272
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.676
a path to a hard-won peace.

273
00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.039
So. what was it. really?

274
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.179
There are certain flaws
in the formula.

275
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.259
Flaws that are only
revealing themselves

276
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.037
now that contracts are signed

277
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.520
and the product's
out in the world.

278
00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:45.519
It's a proper mess for Mycroft.

279
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.259
Who knows where it all ends?

280
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.440
So you bankrupted
your brother's company?

281
00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:51.500
Better. perhaps.
to imagine a chain reaction.

282
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.837
A process. once begun.

283
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.300
that can lead only
to transformation.

284
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.300
You're bankrupting a bunch
of companies?

285
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.059
Cracks in the foundation.
Watson.

286
00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:03.413
One edifice crumbles.
a better one arises.

287
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.000
Mycroft knows I have guile.

288
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.997
He probably suspects I wouldn't
have set this in motion

289
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.319
unless I can enjoy the show.

290
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.880
So you're not here
investigating.

291
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.840
You're more just...

292
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.000
hiding out in Pittsburgh.

293
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.290
You know
you can't do cocaine here.

294
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.910
I haven't touched the stuff
in years.

295
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.967
Okay. but when you're not busy.
you're bored.

296
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.370
And when you're bored...

297
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.139
Well. we both know
what happens when you get bored.

298
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.840
How could I be bored. my friend?
I've got you.

299
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.200
And I've got
the best show on Earth.

300
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.190
Repercussions of Diogenes'

301
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.527
tumble continue to be felt
across the en...

302
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.870
Good morning. Mr. Collier.

303
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.550
Shinwell Johnson.

304
00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:54.690
First year nursing student and
general dogsbody to John Watson.

305
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.050
You're moving
to UHOP today. guv.

306
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.827
Dr. Watson sent me to observe.
and to see if there's anything

307
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.110
you want to discuss
before the move?

308
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.480
I have to get that.

309
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.540
That's the second call in a row.

310
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.220
He's not going to stop.

311
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.250
Hey. Shinwell.

312
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.527
No. I got in early. I am...

313
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.010
the only one here.

314
00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:36.448
Erase that. Erase that.

315
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.289
Sorry.
Uh. just talking to myself.

316
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.250
No. I-I don't know
why Watson's not picking up.

317
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.050
What's up?

318
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.310
Lucky said what?

319
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.970
"Someone on this floor
dies today."

320
00:14:50.107 --> 00:14:51.841
Lucky said that?
What does it mean?

321
00:14:51.924 --> 00:14:54.137
Shinwell's not sure.
Lucky's not communicated since.

322
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.860
He's probably wiped out
from the past day.

323
00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:58.029
Maybe it's the beginning
of a pun.

324
00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:00.489
We'll ask him
when he comes back around.

325
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.746
In the meantime.
can the two of you head over

326
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:05.309
to Van Kirk
to help with the transfer?

327
00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:07.089
I'll make sure the room's ready.

328
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.350
What's this?

329
00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:16.389
Oh. uh. just a project
I want to do around here.

330
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:18.999
Hmm.

331
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.837
Well. the two of you are not
gonna be doing a project

332
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.140
in my office.

333
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.259
Not today. not tomorrow.
not ever.

334
00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:30.159
Understood?

335
00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:31.574
Yup.

336
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.330
You're sure
this guy's going to show up?

337
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.029
Dr. Schiff
was fanatically punctual.

338
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.030
-Not sure what's going on.
-Huh.

339
00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:49.570
-How do you handle it?
-Hmm?

340
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.750
Being sober.

341
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.450
doing the work.

342
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.530
Seems like a grind.
seems tedious.

343
00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.289
It can be.

344
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.067
You probably fly
through some days.

345
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.350
and then there are probably
others when it's just too much.

346
00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.450
I mean. following a playbook.
how to work on yourself.

347
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.570
Always.
Every single freaking moment.

348
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.950
Are we still talking about me?

349
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.570
Don't you ever... I don't know...
have a cheat day?

350
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.130
I do.

351
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.530
I have.

352
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.030
Ingrid.

353
00:16:24.202 --> 00:16:25.678
Oh.

354
00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:27.110
How are you?

355
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.710
Dr. Schiff.
Thank you for meeting us here.

356
00:16:29.869 --> 00:16:31.610
-Um. this is Adam Croft.
-Hi.

357
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.130
Call me Ethan.

358
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.090
It's been a while
since you were in med school.

359
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.110
Ethan. The brain-computer
interface you're working on.

360
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.850
We just took on a patient that
would be a perfect candidate...

361
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.410
I don't work
at Schiff Interfaces anymore.

362
00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:46.149
I don't work anywhere
at the moment.

363
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.627
I'm doing some guest lecturing

364
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.990
until
I can pick up a faculty job.

365
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.627
But aren't you... Schiff?

366
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.110
I wish that mattered.

367
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.710
I have partners.

368
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.630
We're in a lawsuit.

369
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.450
A couple of different lawsuits. actually.

370
00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:02.267
You invented the BCI.
It's yours.

371
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.289
I know. And it's beautiful.

372
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.327
Everything else. unfortunately?
Ugly.

373
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.880
I. uh...

374
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.087
I brought the names of some of
the best interfaces out there.

375
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.430
The patient's been in the ICU
for nearly 16 years.

376
00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.569
He's been bankrupt.

377
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.690
We need a clinical trial.

378
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.230
I wish I could help.

379
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.329
Maybe take this just in case.

380
00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:30.869
It's good to see you. Ingrid.

381
00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:33.589
Thank you.

382
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.050
That is why I work very hard
not to take a cheat day.

383
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.890
He's drunk.

384
00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:44.291
It's 11:00 a.m.

385
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.390
Trust me.

386
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.610
I've spent a lot of time

387
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.610
in meetings with people
pretending to be sober.

388
00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:57.099
Morning. Lucky.

389
00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:59.559
We should be moving you
within an hour.

390
00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:01.394
Everyone at UHOP's
looking forward to having you.

391
00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:05.131
Doctors.

392
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.250
can I have a moment?

393
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.590
The patient's name
was Cynthia Sawyer.

394
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.430
They pronounced her
not ten minutes ago.

395
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.550
"Someone on this floor
dies today."

396
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.410
Lucky's message from earlier.

397
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.627
How could he have known?

398
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.010
It's an intensive care unit.

399
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.910
People die all the time.

400
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.730
Sure. I guess.

401
00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:08.839
Watson?

402
00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:11.779
Detective Lestrade.
How've you been?

403
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:14.379
Divorced. I've been divorced.

404
00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.236
She took the half of
my net worth that was left over

405
00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:17.720
from all the others
that got took.

406
00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:19.180
How many divorces we talking?

407
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440
This would make three.

408
00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:23.460
But hey.
I'm on the market now. handsome.

409
00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:24.956
Is that why you called?

410
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.619
No. I have this patient.

411
00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:29.039
He's been in the hospital
for a long time now.

412
00:19:29.139 --> 00:19:30.659
and I think he saw...

413
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.556
Well. he thinks he saw
this nurse inject something

414
00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:34.639
into a patient's IV.

415
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.000
That patient died.
It looked intentional.

416
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.980
You're treating
a murder witness?

417
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.180
Well. he could be a witness
to multiple murders.

418
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.700
There's this one nurse.

419
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.240
Now. she's not always there. so
I figure she's a travel nurse.

420
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.620
But every time
she's on Lucky's floor.

421
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.117
someone dies.

422
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.460
So. this Lucky?

423
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.480
He's seen a bunch of killings.

424
00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:56.240
but he's just now getting around
to telling someone about it?

425
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.480
It's complicated.

426
00:19:58.399 --> 00:19:59.459
Can I talk to him?

427
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.340
Depends on what you mean
by "talk."

428
00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:03.819
Lucky.

429
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.240
Pretty ballsy name
for a guy in his position.

430
00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:09.619
I'm sorry. Your position.

431
00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:11.399
I get it now.

432
00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:13.700
I mean.
I'm still completely confused.

433
00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.740
but I get
why this case is a "you" thing.

434
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.537
-What are you confused about?
-This gentleman

435
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.940
has a fixed perspective
on the world. let's call it.

436
00:20:21.319 --> 00:20:23.016
And I'm supposed to believe
that. every so often.

437
00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:26.359
a nurse walks right into that
little box and does a murder?

438
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.657
And in all that time.
he's never read a name tag

439
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.837
or seen the woman's face?

440
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.696
Well. I only have
a detailed description

441
00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:32.979
of the first time it happened.

442
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.816
And he didn't see a face then.

443
00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:36.259
but doesn't mean
it never happened.

444
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.377
Can we. you know?

445
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.860
He hasn't said anything
for a while.

446
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.080
It's exhausting to communicate
the way Lucky does.

447
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.020
Once he gets some rest.
we'll know more.

448
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.295
Hmm.

449
00:20:47.419 --> 00:20:49.596
"In limbo.
setting the bar low means

450
00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:50.780
setting the bar very high."

451
00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.199
Yeah. well he. um...
he likes puns.

452
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.477
This was on his patient board
at Van Kirk.

453
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.639
so we copied it here.

454
00:20:57.399 --> 00:20:58.719
Listen. you know I'm game.

455
00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:01.379
Run tests on that woman
that died at Van Kirk today.

456
00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:04.439
I'll sit with you
when Lucky comes back around.

457
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.556
But until then. you either need
a lot more information

458
00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:08.760
or a much better detective.

459
00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:10.919
You got one of those
lying around?

460
00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:12.719
Actually. I do.

461
00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:14.356
-Hey. screw you.
-No. don't be salty.

462
00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.779
I just happen to have
the best detective in the world.

463
00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:18.279
You're looking for a woman.

464
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.580
Five foot six or taller.

465
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.439
weighing more than ten stone.

466
00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:25.936
She worked in emergency rooms
during the pandemic.

467
00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:29.139
and likely has
an orthopedic heel on one shoe.

468
00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.619
That's cool. That's cool.

469
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.220
I still don't know
how you do that.

470
00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:35.179
but it's cool.
How do you do that. seriously?

471
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500
Consider the facts.

472
00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.119
A consideration becomes
an inference.

473
00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:41.359
an inference
becomes a deduction.

474
00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:43.443
Uh-huh. So you don't want
to tell me how you did it?

475
00:21:43.526 --> 00:21:45.471
You know. I'm-a get
the single sticks.

476
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:49.199
-That was a fluke.
-No. Holmes. it was not a fluke.

477
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:54.020
Of course. this woman.
Murder Nurse.

478
00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:58.076
didn't just plop herself down
in front of Lucky

479
00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.439
and kill over and over again.

480
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.820
In fact.

481
00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:06.020
that night back in 2020 might be
the only time she did that.

482
00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:10.659
But your man.
vision is not his only tool.

483
00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:13.500
Can't move his head.
so it's not even his best one.

484
00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.619
So you're saying that
Lucky can hear her?

485
00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:18.119
I think your nurse
has a sonic signature.

486
00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:20.979
When Lucky hears this.
he knows she's back.

487
00:22:22.399 --> 00:22:24.899
Soon. cometh the sound
of a code on the floor.

488
00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:28.740
Chaos. then the
sacramental hush of death.

489
00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:31.399
Murder Nurse has struck again.

490
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.880
She's larger than average.

491
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.257
makes heavy footfalls.

492
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.800
so must be something distinct
about the pattern.

493
00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:38.216
Okay. what about the ER? COVID?

494
00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:40.579
It's the flourish on my part.
but the reasoning's sound.

495
00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:44.339
I believe she commenced
this grim business in 2020.

496
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.940
Nurses in the front line
were getting shouted at.

497
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.939
spat on. read for filth.

498
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.056
Your woman channels her contempt
for patients toward the weakest

499
00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:54.616
and most vulnerable among them.

500
00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:58.074
Hmm.

501
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.160
Oh. no. again?
It's not even breakfast.

502
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.717
-Eat your toad in the hole.
-Oh. man. this is.

503
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800
this is awful.

504
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.140
I'm not here.

505
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Hey. Mary.

506
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.336
Is. uh. everything okay?

507
00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:19.977
You told the fellows
there's a nurse

508
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.139
killing people
at Van Kirk Memorial.

509
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.540
and then you just disappeared.

510
00:23:24.139 --> 00:23:25.659
You haven't been responding
to anybody.

511
00:23:26.219 --> 00:23:28.059
Yeah. I got locked
in a train of thought. um...

512
00:23:29.339 --> 00:23:31.559
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you had company.

513
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.036
I don't. Oh. I will.
I-I was going to.

514
00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:37.259
Listen. I have to get back
to the office.

515
00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:39.839
I want the names of all
the travel nurses at Van Kirk.

516
00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:42.517
I'll make some calls.
What about your thing?

517
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.880
You're just gonna leave it here?

518
00:23:46.689 --> 00:23:49.210
Ingrid. something on your mind?

519
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.250
Nothing.

520
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.570
I'm good tonight.

521
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.770
Everything's stable.

522
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.450
I can translate there.

523
00:23:57.069 --> 00:23:58.069
She's bored.

524
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.110
She's gonna do
something dangerous.

525
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.609
I'm not bored. I'm normal.

526
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:07.269
You want details?

527
00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:09.049
Fine.

528
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.990
There's a patient at the clinic.
he needs this BCI.

529
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.530
a brain-computer interface.

530
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:16.289
A doctor I know
just changed the game there.

531
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.387
but he partnered
with these venture capitalists

532
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.750
who have it all
tied up in court.

533
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:21.149
You do sound bored.

534
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.529
Annoyed is not bored.

535
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:26.230
I want to help this patient.
The situation sucks.

536
00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:28.430
Still think you have
a big mistake incoming.

537
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.950
This company. what's it called?

538
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.230
Schiff Interfaces.

539
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.490
That sounds like
Schiff Interfaces has...

540
00:24:34.249 --> 00:24:36.570
someone like us on
the other side of this lawsuit.

541
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:39.009
A member of
the antisocial tribe.

542
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.730
I don't know how you counter.

543
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:44.050
unless you're willing to get
down in the mud. gouge eyes.

544
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.889
-Like we do.
-Like we did.

545
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:48.169
Thank you. Glen.

546
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.389
Because in therapy.
we don't gouge eyes.

547
00:24:51.629 --> 00:24:55.190
so I guess your patient
is just... boned.

548
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.670
Lucky.

549
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.950
They say you're in there.
What a story.

550
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.190
I talked to a couple of the
girls over at Van Kirk today.

551
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.830
Nurses. we...
we love to chatter.

552
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.947
They say there's
an investigation into a woman

553
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.670
who died in their ICU yesterday?

554
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.550
They say you're the one
who started the whole thing.

555
00:25:49.205 --> 00:25:50.625
Lucky.

556
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.390
Lost to the world.
but watching us the whole time.

557
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.470
What did you see?

558
00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:00.269
What did you say?

559
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.539
Well. doesn't matter too much.

560
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.560
Most patients.
they're like most people.

561
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.540
Staring at their phones.

562
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.800
Scrolling through
conspiracy theories.

563
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.460
getting meaner and dumber
every second.

564
00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:17.680
That's not you. though.

565
00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:20.799
You seem like
something different.

566
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.290
And this...
this might sound weird.

567
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:28.630
but I wish you well.

568
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.600
Lucky's been unresponsive
for too long.

569
00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.920
He's lying limp.
his eyes are half closed.

570
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.477
Maybe another stroke?
We should do a non-contrast CT

571
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.920
to check for
intracranial bleeding.

572
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.196
It could be an infection
causing stroke recrudescence.

573
00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:07.440
Beats a stroke by a long way.

574
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.237
Treat the infection. the
non-responsiveness goes away.

575
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.420
Exactly. CBC. blood cultures.
urinalysis. urine cultures.

576
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.860
Okay. good. Get it all going.

577
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.620
Or...

578
00:27:19.939 --> 00:27:22.120
the man saw a murder.

579
00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:26.220
That makes him very inconvenient
for the killer in question.

580
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480
Key word being "killer."

581
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.000
If Murder Nurse wanted Lucky
dead. wouldn't he be dead?

582
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.539
Probably. Maybe.

583
00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:34.400
It's a tricky thing.
killing someone.

584
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.079
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

585
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.599
Dr. Derian makes a good point.

586
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.119
Murder Nurse could have
been interrupted.

587
00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:46.059
This could've been a first step
in a two-stage plan.

588
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.377
This kind of thing has happened
before plenty of times.

589
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.337
unfortunately.

590
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.160
Look into angels of death.

591
00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:53.159
find out what type
of methods they used.

592
00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:55.680
see if any of those can explain
Lucky's change in status.

593
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.200
I got the travel nurses
at Van Kirk.

594
00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.380
The one on top?
According to her supervisor.

595
00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:04.740
she wears an orthotic shoe.

596
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.320
-"Haven Henry."
-John.

597
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.740
she has a contract here. too.
at the South Hills satellite.

598
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.240
Yeah. we got you now.
Mr. Collier.

599
00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:27.720
And I ain't gonna leave
this room until you're better.

600
00:28:27.837 --> 00:28:29.071
All right?

601
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.360
This woman has
a distinctive footfall.

602
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.157
It's more audible
than it would be otherwise

603
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.380
because she's heavier than
average with a distinctive gait.

604
00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:38.740
That's how Lucky tracked
her comings and goings?

605
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.420
We hope to get more from Lucky.
but. hey. it all makes sense.

606
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.020
It's brilliant.

607
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.019
Extravagant. but brilliant.

608
00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:48.839
I want to meet this guy.
the world's greatest detective.

609
00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:50.879
I'm-I'm sorry. who?

610
00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.037
You ran out yesterday.
and you said

611
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.040
you had access to the
world's greatest detective.

612
00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:57.500
I assume that's why I'm holding
this personnel file.

613
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.120
Yeah. that was just
a figure of speech.

614
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.920
I'm sorry. if you're right.

615
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.820
this woman has been
killing people for years.

616
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.540
She is on her second
travel contract at my hospital.

617
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.577
What can we do?

618
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.276
Well. she's not at UHOP now.
is she?

619
00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:12.697
No. I told her supervisor
to have her stay home today

620
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.960
and say we're overstaffed.

621
00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:15.939
They'll keep her off the floor
at Van Kirk. too.

622
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.980
All right. well.
that's under control.

623
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.400
I can call the other hospitals
that she's worked for.

624
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.500
build a paper trail.

625
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.440
But without actual evidence
or an eyewitness.

626
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.380
I can't arrest her.
We need Lucky back.

627
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.500
We're working on it.

628
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.760
What about insulin?

629
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.680
Worked for Elizabeth Wettlaufer.

630
00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.740
Lucky's glucose is normal.
Tests came back ten minutes ago.

631
00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:38.779
Paralytic?

632
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.420
It-It's not a murder method
when you're ventilated.

633
00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.119
but it explains
pretty much everything.

634
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.019
A shot wouldn't last that long.

635
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.700
and we know that Lucky's
not getting repeated injections.

636
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220
Oh. um.

637
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.180
can I get a number for your
old professor? Dr. Schiff?

638
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.320
Why? He can't help us.

639
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.000
I'm trying to help him.
if he wants it.

640
00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:04.919
It's called a Twelfth Step call.

641
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.620
Someone's suffering. you visit.

642
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.580
tell them there's a better way.
if they're looking for one.

643
00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:12.299
What do you get out of it?

644
00:30:12.419 --> 00:30:14.119
I get to stay sober today. hopefully.

645
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.659
I get to work the steps.

646
00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:18.319
Ugh. "The work."

647
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.980
It is boring.

648
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.419
But it's also
how you get better.

649
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.789
Why are all those crossed off?

650
00:30:27.589 --> 00:30:28.950
Uh. because they're bad ideas.

651
00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:30.889
I'll be the judge of that.

652
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.377
Call Sasha and Stephens.
Tell them to meet us

653
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.537
in Lucky's room
with a crash cart

654
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.000
and four milligrams
per kilogram of sugammadex.

655
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.620
Why would he need a crash cart?

656
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.577
A paralytic won't kill Lucky.

657
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.060
but a paralytic
makes perfect sense.

658
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160
Explain that. please.

659
00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:52.617
Murder Nurse
would only move against Lucky

660
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.777
if she knew she was suspect.

661
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.460
-Murder Nurse? Haven Henry.
-Let's keep things simple.

662
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.180
If Murder Nurse kills Lucky.
the spotlight turns on her.

663
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.420
People are reviewing
security cameras on his floor.

664
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.800
-It's bad for her.
-Exactly.

665
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.176
But if she filled his IV bag
with rocuronium.

666
00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:07.360
meaning he gets
a continuous dose over time.

667
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.780
Lucky's still alive.

668
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.920
The world thinks he's just
not responding right now.

669
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.637
Murder Nurse can come back.
keep him paralyzed

670
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.260
again and again
until things calm down.

671
00:31:14.353 --> 00:31:15.697
Then she has a window
to do what she needs to do.

672
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.900
Which is murder. by the way.

673
00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.840
Why do we need a crash cart?

674
00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:21.237
Murder Nurse gave Lucky
a paralytic in his IV bag.

675
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.823
He plans to administer
the sugammadex.

676
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.920
It's dangerous. though.

677
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.346
If we don't know
how much paralytic Lucky got.

678
00:31:27.429 --> 00:31:29.580
we don't know how much
of the reversal agent he needs.

679
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.257
And if we get the dosage wrong.
Lucky can go into anaphylaxis.

680
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.257
That's what
the crash cart is for.

681
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.497
Prepare a dose of epinephrine.

682
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.277
We could just wait
for the paralytic to wear off.

683
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.440
Lucky is suffering now.

684
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.717
He's the target
of a serial killer.

685
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.757
We're not waiting.

686
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840
Keep that epi ready.

687
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.857
If I'm right about this.
Lucky will be able

688
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.237
to move his eyelids
to communicate

689
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.340
in 30 seconds or less.

690
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.397
Lucky.
I hope that you can hear me.

691
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.800
and I really hope
you can respond.

692
00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.860
Do you recognize this woman?

693
00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:01.559
Is this the woman
you've been talking about?

694
00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:04.460
Blink twice if it is.

695
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.030
That's one blink. He's back.

696
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:14.889
And there's two.

697
00:32:14.997 --> 00:32:16.923
Get Detective Lestrade.

698
00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:18.069
We've got our witness.

699
00:32:22.739 --> 00:32:24.960
Cynthia Sawyer. the woman
who just died at Van Kirk.

700
00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:26.639
We have her initial tests back.

701
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.537
She had evidence
of synthetic insulin

702
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.960
in her blood. but she wasn't
being treated for diabetes.

703
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.980
She's injecting insulin
to induce hypoglycemia.

704
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.600
Haven Henry.
That's how she's killing people.

705
00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:39.236
You've all been looking into
her jobs. What have you learned?

706
00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:40.919
She works in Indianapolis.

707
00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.519
I've been tracking
15 suspicious deaths so far.

708
00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:45.319
Another 11 in Grand Rapids.

709
00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:47.980
And here? Pittsburgh? UHOP?

710
00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:50.516
Cynthia Sawyer.
a few others at Van Kirk.

711
00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:53.242
UHOP South Hills doesn't have
a long-term care unit.

712
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.752
so nothing there.

713
00:32:54.879 --> 00:32:56.579
Just spoke
to Detective Lestrade.

714
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.677
Haven Henry flew to London
right after her supervisor

715
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760
told her to stay home.

716
00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:04.339
From there. she took a Hastings
Airline flight to Hanoi.

717
00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:05.960
It lands in four hours.

718
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.300
So. we tell it to turn around.

719
00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:09.940
It's no longer in our airspace.
Our laws don't apply.

720
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.757
It's registered to Britain.
We've reached out.

721
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.880
but it's gonna take time.

722
00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:14.117
She'll be on the ground soon.

723
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.519
On the ground in Vietnam?

724
00:33:16.659 --> 00:33:18.299
Where there's
no extradition treaty?

725
00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:19.999
What do we do?

726
00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:23.200
Well. it's not
a medical issue anymore.

727
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.919
It's law enforcement now.

728
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.957
Watson. this woman
has killed patients

729
00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.360
all over the Northeast.

730
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.020
Here in Pittsburgh.

731
00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:35.079
We still got four hours.

732
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.919
You've all come so far.

733
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.560
I'm grateful for that.

734
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.276
Keep at it. I'll check in.

735
00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:45.079
-Where are you going?
-I said. keep at it!

736
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.500
I will check in.

737
00:33:57.313 --> 00:33:59.076
Sherlock?

738
00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:01.659
Sherlock?

739
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.130
I have to leave
earlier than expected.

740
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:09.927
Sorry we didn't get a chance

741
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.910
to dig into
the Pittsburgh mystery.

742
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.527
-We'd have fun there. Watson.
-I need your help.

743
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.450
There's a plane
that's in the air.

744
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:18.829
A murderer is on her way
to Vietnam.

745
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.390
It's traveling through
several countries' airspaces

746
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.310
within 30 minutes.
Now. when it lands.

747
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.970
we're gonna lose her forever.

748
00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:30.159
That is a pickle. Which airline?

749
00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:32.238
Hastings.

750
00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:34.245
Holmes. what...?

751
00:34:37.099 --> 00:34:38.739
Inspector
Gregson's office. please.

752
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.289
Yes. hello.
Um. this is a concerned citizen.

753
00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:49.829
Is the inspector there?
I-I have a tip.

754
00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.806
Fair enough. Could you please

755
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.469
tell him I have a friend...

756
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:55.030
real name Richard Bent.

757
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.130
he may be flying
under an alias...

758
00:34:57.849 --> 00:35:00.246
he's on Hastings Air Flight...

759
00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:02.670
-429.
-429.

760
00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:06.489
I found certain journals.
which are alarming.

761
00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:09.630
I believe he's planning
to set off a bomb.

762
00:35:10.469 --> 00:35:12.710
either in the air
or when it lands.

763
00:35:13.869 --> 00:35:14.869
Thank you.

764
00:35:14.993 --> 00:35:17.124
You just called in
a terror threat.

765
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.869
More like a threat of a threat.

766
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:22.110
Anyway. they'll ground
that plane.

767
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.469
Make sure to grab
Miss Murder Nurse when they do.

768
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:29.710
"Thank you. Sherlock."

769
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:31.629
I'm worried about you. Sherlock.

770
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.350
I'm really worried. I mean.
listen. helping one person.

771
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.447
curing a disease.
catching a criminal.

772
00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.889
I get all of that.

773
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.290
It seems like you're out
to help the whole world.

774
00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:44.810
That's dangerous.

775
00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.769
There are a lot of bad people
that got started just like that.

776
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.690
Lucky for us.
I'm not a bad person.

777
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.827
"The new Allegheny River
Turnpike Bridge

778
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.190
"is currently
under construction.

779
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.790
"The current old bridge.
a sturdy.

780
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.767
trusty old marvel
of truss construction..."

781
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:15.869
I hear you have news.

782
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.186
I do indeed. Hastings Air
Flight 429 has been grounded

783
00:36:20.269 --> 00:36:22.230
in the nation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

784
00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:24.670
Haven Henry is on her way back
to the USA.

785
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.210
and I will be there
at the airport to meet her.

786
00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:29.410
Incredible. What a break.

787
00:36:29.809 --> 00:36:32.309
Tell me about this
world's greatest detective.

788
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.789
calls in the odd bomb threat?

789
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.950
There's nothing to tell.
I guess we got lucky.

790
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.300
Why'd you want to meet
in Lucky's room?

791
00:36:44.519 --> 00:36:46.800
Maybe I heard this is where
the good puns are hiding.

792
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.837
Maybe I heard
about another candidate

793
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.457
for the loneliest person
in the world.

794
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.420
and my competitive
instincts kick in.

795
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.220
Maybe I just get stuck
in my own head. too.

796
00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.920
I think about divorce.
bank statements.

797
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.300
dying alone.

798
00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.500
I like this guy.

799
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.980
He doesn't interrupt.

800
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600
I'll leave you to it.

801
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.519
Until next time. Dr. Watson.

802
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800
Don't be a stranger.

803
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.077
"I remember my dad
used to complain bitterly

804
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.439
about how terrible
the traffic was when crossing."

805
00:37:29.259 --> 00:37:31.579
Dr. Schiff? Ethan. sorry.

806
00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:33.179
I was surprised
to hear from you.

807
00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.560
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

808
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.060
Better than okay. actually.

809
00:37:38.399 --> 00:37:40.040
Things are good.

810
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.659
It's been a while
since I could say that.

811
00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:45.839
The venture capital firm
that I got in bed with?

812
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.879
They dropped their lawsuit.

813
00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:50.436
Really? Did they say why?

814
00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:51.619
No idea.

815
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.179
They're stepping back.

816
00:37:53.779 --> 00:37:55.540
A minority partnership.

817
00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:01.000
The brain-computer interface.
it's mine again.

818
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:04.059
I would love to welcome
your patient into a trial.

819
00:38:05.859 --> 00:38:08.839
You don't know anything
about how this happened. do you?

820
00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:10.559
Of course not.

821
00:38:10.919 --> 00:38:14.199
Sorry. It's just so
out of the blue.

822
00:38:14.779 --> 00:38:16.039
I'm looking for a reason.

823
00:38:16.819 --> 00:38:17.819
Congratulations.

824
00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:19.679
I'll arrange a meet for you two.

825
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:23.897
Ingrid?

826
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.560
You don't know why
your-your colleague

827
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.279
keeps leaving me messages.
do you?

828
00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:31.839
No clue. Maybe call him back.

829
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.110
You're not gonna say thank you?

830
00:38:48.809 --> 00:38:49.809
For what?

831
00:38:50.805 --> 00:38:52.902
Schiff Interfaces.

832
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.206
I know the VCs. I called them.

833
00:38:55.289 --> 00:38:57.190
Mm. you call them.
and they drop their lawsuit?

834
00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.690
Well. I have this kid
at the incubator.

835
00:38:59.949 --> 00:39:02.329
He's got everyone excited
about some AI thing.

836
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.150
Honestly. I'm not even sure
if it's a good idea.

837
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:07.269
but the space is white-hot.

838
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:12.289
That's right. You have
an incubator. it's called?

839
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.147
I promised the kid's idea
to the VCs at Schiff.

840
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.727
but only if they
settled their lawsuit

841
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.370
and brought the doctor in
from the cold.

842
00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:20.130
Took about ten seconds.

843
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.767
The interface
never scaled past patients

844
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:23.850
with locked-in syndrome.

845
00:39:24.769 --> 00:39:26.369
And why would you do all that?

846
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.210
I don't know.

847
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.190
Fun.

848
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:32.950
To gouge eyes.

849
00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:36.110
Or maybe because
you asked me to.

850
00:39:37.269 --> 00:39:38.269
Don't remember that.

851
00:39:39.269 --> 00:39:40.269
Yeah. you did.

852
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.210
The other day.
when you shared. you asked.

853
00:39:44.049 --> 00:39:45.049
Well done.

854
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.909
Anyway. you're welcome.

855
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.989
I'm not going to say thank you.

856
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.610
But when we're done
with the session today.

857
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.210
you can give me your address.

858
00:39:58.769 --> 00:40:02.150
If it's clean. and you're
there alone at 9:00 tonight.

859
00:40:02.286 --> 00:40:03.442
I'll be there.

860
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.799
Told you. Big mistake incoming.

861
00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:09.560
More like a cheat day.

862
00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:14.659
You're both here. Good.

863
00:40:16.178 --> 00:40:18.031
Uh...

864
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.180
Let's get started.

865
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.580
You waiting for me?

866
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.989
You've done a good job
with these fellows. John.

867
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.710
They all want to do extra work.
They all want to do good work.

868
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:38.189
And I'm proud of them.
All of them.

869
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.907
Then why did you bail twice

870
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.790
when they're trying
to help you fix a problem?

871
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.690
You ran out on that detective.
too. from what it sounds like.

872
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.309
They all feel that.

873
00:40:46.789 --> 00:40:49.266
Now. the fellows.
they haven't complained to me.

874
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:51.429
and I'd tell them to take it up
with you if they did.

875
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.949
but I promise you. they feel it.

876
00:40:54.329 --> 00:40:55.929
Is everything okay. John?

877
00:40:58.387 --> 00:41:01.106
Guv? Guv?

878
00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:05.429
John Watson.

879
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.849
I trust you remember me.
My name is Mycroft Holmes.

880
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.469
Yes. of course.
Good to see you again.

881
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.826
You as well.
Forgive the surprise.

882
00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:18.447
I find it best
in these situations

883
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.930
to drop in unannounced.

884
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.530
"These situations"?

885
00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:25.989
Well. I'm here to evaluate
my investment in this clinic.

886
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.630
Sherlock funded
this clinic. not you.

887
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:30.849
My brother is dead. isn't he?

888
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.347
Sherlock excelled
at many things.

889
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.750
but I can assure you
that crafting

890
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.690
impregnable legal language
was not one of them.

891
00:41:39.489 --> 00:41:41.170
My brother may have
founded this clinic.

892
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.329
but it functions now
under my auspices.

893
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.670
