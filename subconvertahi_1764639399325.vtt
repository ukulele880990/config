[ Girl ]
I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?

4
00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.469
Miss. Young lady.
Excuse me. Girls.

5
00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:38.639
Hey. hey. little fella.

Hey. Hey. big fella.
Excuse me.

8
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.688
- Come help me make up
these beds in the living room!
- Excuse me. Ma'am!

9
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.191
- Hi. Hey. son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

10
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.861
Big fella!
Hey! Hey. hey. hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

11
00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:57.282
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh. it's crazy.

12
00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.618
[ Woman on phone ] Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

13
00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.787
- Uh-huh.
- That's right. Her family's there.

14
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.789
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

15
00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.833
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready. are you?

16
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:10.671
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me watch
the movie. but the big kids can.

17
00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.549
- Why can't I?
- Kevin. I'm on the phone.

18
00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.135
When do you come back?
Not till then?

19
00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.596
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

20
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.933
Kevin. if Uncle Frank
says no.

21
00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.227
then it must be really bad.

22
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.479
We're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him—

23
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.982
Hey. hey. hey! Get off.
Kevin. out of the room.

24
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.484
Hang up the phone and make me.
why don't ya?

25
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.488
- Oh. this kid.
- Kate. did you by any chance
pick up a voltage adaptor thing?

26
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.490
I didn't have time to do that.

27
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.492
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

28
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.495
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad. nobody'll let me do anything.

29
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.497
I've got something for you to do.

30
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.083
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

31
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.044
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

32
00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.214
- He was in the garage again.
playing with the glue gun.
- Didn't we talk about that?

33
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.342
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

34
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.595
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

35
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.471
My new fishhooks?

36
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:06.310
I can't make ornaments out of the old
ones. with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

37
00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:10.272
- Peter.
- Come on. Kevin. Out.

38
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.858
Peter. Kate. do you guys
have a voltage adaptor?

39
00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.195
- Here! Here's a voltage adaptor.
- Oh. you're getting heavy.

40
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.447
Go pack your suitcase.

41
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.701
Pack my suitcase?

42
00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.287
- Do you know where the shampoo is. Fuller?
- I don't live here.

43
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.831
A house with this many people.
there's no shampoo?

44
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.083
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah. but they don't live here.

45
00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.878
- Tracy. did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

46
00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:36.215
- Excuse me. miss. Are your parents here?
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

47
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.217
- Hi!
- Hi!

48
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.885
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.887
- Do they live here?
- No.

50
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:46.975
No. Why should they?
All kids. no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

51
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:51.146
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done this once in my whole life.

52
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.523
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

53
00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.318
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin. "Tough."

54
00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.154
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

55
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.740
Shake his hand and say. "Congratulations.
you're an idiot"?

56
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.743
- I'm not an idiot!
- Oh. really? You're completely helpless!

57
00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.579
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right. Kev.

58
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.541
Excuse me. puke-breath. I'm
a lot smaller than you. I don't
know how to pack a suitcase.

59
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:15.212
- I hope you didn't just pack crap. Jeff.
- Shut up. Linnie.

60
00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.214
Do you know what I should pack?

61
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.592
Buzz told you. cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

62
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.637
Listen. Kev. what are
you so worried about?

63
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:26.515
You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.

64
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.851
You're what the French call
les incompetents.

65
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.939
- What?
- Bombs away!

66
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.947
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

67
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.826
If he has something to drink.
he's gonna wet the bed.

68
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.704
This house is so full of people.
it makes me sick!

69
00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.832
When I grow up and get married.
I'm livin' alone!

70
00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.751
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

71
00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.587
I'm livin' alone!

72
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.342
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

73
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:06.847
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

74
00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:11.476
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

75
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.271
Some don't.

76
00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.273
But they got nude beaches.

77
00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:19.401
Not in the winter.

78
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.826
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock. phlegm-wad?

79
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.455
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

80
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.498
If he has something to drink.
he'll wet the bed.

81
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:38.253
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

82
00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:43.258
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

83
00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.722
Who is he?

84
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:53.185
[ Buzz ]
You ever heard of
the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

85
00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.187
- No.
- That's him.

86
00:05:55.271 --> 00:06:00.108
Back in '58. he murdered his whole
family and half the people on his block...

87
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.528
with a snow shovel.

88
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.948
Been hiding out in this
neighborhood ever since.

89
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.535
Well. if he's the Shovel Slayer.
how come the cops don't arrest him?

90
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.537
Not enough evidence to convict.

91
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.207
They never found the bodies.

92
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.542
But everyone around here
knows he did it.

93
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:21.380
Now it'll just be a matter of
time before he does it again.

94
00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.465
What's he doin' now?

95
00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:27.511
He walks up and down
the streets every night...

96
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.888
salting the sidewalks.

97
00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:31.973
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

98
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.936
No way.

99
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.064
See that garbage can full of salt?

100
00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.150
That's where he keeps his victims.

101
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.153
The salt turns the bodies...

102
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.073
into mummies.

103
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:51.118
- Wow.
- Mummies.

104
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.499
Look out!

105
00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:32.075
[ Policeman ]
How you kids doin'.
huh? Good?

106
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.870
Lot of action around here today. huh?

107
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.664
Goin' on vacation?
Where you goin'?

108
00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:42.085
Do you hear me or what?
Goin' on a trip?

109
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.254
Where you goin'. kid?

110
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.600
Okay. that's $122.50.

111
00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:58.643
Not for me. kid.
I don't live here.

112
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:02.731
- Oh. You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

113
00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:06.193
- Hey. pizza's here!
- Here you go. That's $122.50.

114
00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.945
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

115
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.282
Hey. listen. uh—

116
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:15.785
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

117
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.205
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

118
00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.333
- Yes.
- Oh. good. 'cause somebody owes me $122.50.

119
00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:24.961
- I'd like a word with you. sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

120
00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:28.882
No. no. It's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

121
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:33.345
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

122
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.599
Oh. yeah. Well. we have automatic timers
for our lights. locks for our doors.

123
00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.809
That's about as well
as anybody can do.

124
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.103
- You get some eggnog?
- Come on. Dad.

125
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.105
Let's eat.
Come on.

126
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.192
- Eggnog? Listen. are you gonna be leav... uh—
- Pizza! Pizza!

127
00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.152
Pizza!

128
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:52.405
[ Woman ] Grab yourself a napkin. You're
gonna have to pour your own drinks.

129
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.616
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

130
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.952
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

131
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.538
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

132
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:03.875
I hope you're all drinking milk.
I want to get rid of it.
Hey! Don't you dare.

133
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.129
- The pizza boy needs $122.50. plus a tip.
- For pizza?

134
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.048
[ Frank ]
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

135
00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:12.717
- Frank. you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

136
00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.679
Forget it. Frank.
We have cash.

137
00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:18.431
[ Peter ] You've probably
got traveler's checks
that don't work in France.

138
00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:21.518
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

139
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:24.062
Oh. yeah. we did.
But if you want any.

140
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:27.399
somebody's gonna have
to barf it all up. 'cause it's gone.

141
00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:31.027
[ Leslie ]
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

142
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:41.204
Kev! Kevin. get a plate.

143
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.130
Wow!

144
00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:53.049
The passports!
Watch it!

145
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:56.261
[ Frank ] Help me out here!

146
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:59.180
Let's get these passports out of here.

147
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.767
[ Kate ] Kevin. get off of him!
[ Kevin ] You moron!

148
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.438
Are you okay. honey? Come here.
Are you all right?

149
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:08.315
What is the matter with you?

150
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.318
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

151
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.695
He knows I hate sausage and olives and—

152
00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.239
Look what you did. you little jerk!

153
00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:32.380
- Kevin. get upstairs right now.
- Why?

154
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.717
- Kevin. you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

155
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.552
- Kevin. upstairs!
- Say good night. Kevin.

156
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:41.931
- Good night. Kevin.
[ Megan ] Now what's for dinner?

157
00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.309
Why do I always get treated like scum?

158
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:46.811
Oh. I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

159
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.813
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

160
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:52.567
My brother-in-law drove in
from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

161
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.278
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

162
00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.405
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

163
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.949
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

164
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.951
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

165
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:05.955
and his kids are still going
to school here. and I guess
he missed the whole family.

166
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.667
He's giving us this trip
to Paris so we can be together.

167
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.545
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes. we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

168
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.923
Excellent. Excellent.

169
00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:18.176
If you'll excuse me. this one's out of sorts.
I'll be right back.

170
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.096
Don't worry about me. I spoke
to your husband already.

171
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.390
And don't worry about your home.

172
00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.934
It's in good hands.

173
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:32.232
There are 15 people in this
house. You're the only one
who has to make trouble.

174
00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:35.402
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

175
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:40.115
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs. dummy.

176
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:42.784
- The third floor?
- Go.

177
00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:46.121
- It's scary up there.
- Don't be silly. Fuller will
be up in a little while.

178
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:49.416
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

179
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.710
He'll pee all over me.
I know it.

180
00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.837
Fine. We'll put him somewhere else.

181
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.464
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.134
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

183
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.180
Everyone in this family hates me.

184
00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.516
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

185
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.270
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family!
Families suck!

186
00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:13.565
Stay up there. I don't want to see
you again for the rest of the night.

187
00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:16.317
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

188
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.112
And I don't want to see
anybody else either.

189
00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:21.197
I hope you don't mean that.

190
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:25.243
You'd feel pretty sad
if you woke up tomorrow morning
and you didn't have a family.

191
00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:28.872
- No. I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.

192
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:33.376
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see
any of you jerks again.

193
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.525
I wish they would all
just disappear.

194
00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.710
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

195
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.514

199
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:38.668
Well. actually. first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

200
00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:41.337
Do you know the McCallisters

201
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:45.216
Do you know if it's cold there?
Do these vans get good gas mileage?

202

I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

206
00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.272
How fast does this thing go?

207
00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:03.318
Does it have automatic
transmission? Does it have
four-wheel drive?

208
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:07.655
Look. I told you before.

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:01.041
I thought I recognized
one of their voices.

655
00:57:01.126 --> 00:57:04.336
And I know I heard that name Snakes before.

656
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.922
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.

657
00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:09.133
- I don't know no Snakes.
- Snakes.

658
00:57:09.217 --> 00:57:11.844
Let's get out of here.

659
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.890
Hold it. hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

660
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:18.892
We work this neighborhood too.

661
00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:21.770
- Yeah.
Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...

662
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:24.898
and they start asking us questions
about a murder in the area.

663
00:57:24.983 --> 00:57:28.152
Wouldn't it be nice
to have a face to go
with their questions?

664
00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:31.947
That's a good idea.

665
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:35.492
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

666
00:57:35.577 --> 00:57:38.495
He sounded like a snake.

667
00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:45.669
Everything's full.

668
00:57:45.753 --> 00:57:47.671
Evertyhing's full?

669
00:57:47.755 --> 00:57:50.007
I'm very sorry.
but it is Christmas Eve.

670
00:57:50.091 --> 00:57:52.259
What about another airline?

671
00:57:57.682 --> 00:58:00.642
Nothing available. May I help you get
a hotel room in the city?

672
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:04.271
Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.
I can't wait that long.

673
00:58:04.355 --> 00:58:08.775
I'm terribly sorry. ma'am.
but we're doing absolutely
everything we can.

674
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:16.074
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go. people to see.

675
00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:19.495
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

676
00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:23.624
I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

677
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:28.170
I have been from Chicago
to Paris to Dallas to-
Where the hell am I?

678
00:58:28.254 --> 00:58:30.297
Scranton.

679
00:58:30.381 --> 00:58:33.050
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

680
00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:36.553
And now that I'm this close.
you're telling me it's hopeless?

681
00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:40.307
- I'm sorry.
- No. No. no. no. No Way. This is Christmas!

682
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:42.309
The season of perpetual hope!

683
00:58:42.393 --> 00:58:46.188
- Ma'am. if I—
- If I have to get out
on your runway and hitchhike.

684
00:58:46.272 --> 00:58:48.232
if it costs me everything I own.

685
00:58:48.316 --> 00:58:51.193
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself.

686
00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:54.488
I am going to get home to my son.

687
00:58:54.572 --> 00:58:58.700
- Ma'am. if there was anything at
all I could do for you today-
- Do it.

688
00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:01.411
- Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.

689
00:59:01.496 --> 00:59:03.956
- What?
- Excuse me.

690
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:09.753
Can you excuse us for a second?
Can I see you for a second?
Please. Excuse us. Come.

691
00:59:09.837 --> 00:59:13.048
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

692
00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:15.759
We got a crisis ourselves.

693
00:59:15.843 --> 00:59:19.346
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

694
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:22.849
Polka king of the Midwest?

695
00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:28.480
The Kenosha Kickers?

696
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.232
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

697
00:59:30.316 --> 00:59:33.193
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized—

698
00:59:33.278 --> 00:59:36.238
Antways. uh. I had
a few hits a few years ago.

699
00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:39.616
Uh. that's why. you know—
"Polka. Polka. Polka"?

700
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:42.077
♪ Polka. polka. polka ♪

701
00:59:42.161 --> 00:59:44.204
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

702
00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:47.749
"Yamahoozie Polka."
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

703
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:50.502
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

704
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:54.006
Yeah. Yeah. We-
Some fairly big hits for us.

705
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.717
- You know. in the early '70s. you know?
- Oh.

706
00:59:56.801 --> 00:59:59.428
Yeah. we sold
about 623 copies of that.

707
00:59:59.512 --> 01:00:02.180
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

708
01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.433
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

709
01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:06.685
Anyway. I'm rambling on here.

710
01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.855
Our flight was canceled.
so we gotta drive.

711
01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:13.525
So. uh. see the guy
in the yellowjacket over there
by the Budget sign?

712
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.362
He's gonna rent us
a nice big. uh. van. and we're
gonna drive to Milwaukee.

713
01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:21.783
I heard you had some problems
here. uh. gettin' to Chicago
to see your kid or somethin'?

714
01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:25.954
Uh. my son. He-
We left and he's there.

715
01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:30.167
Aw. geez.
If you have to get to Chicago.
we'll gladly drive you.

716
01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:32.544
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

717
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.297
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not. you know?

718
01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:37.924
- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?

719
01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:39.885
Sure. You know.
it's Christmastime.

720
01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.512
Thank you.
Oh. thank you.

721
01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.931
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

722
01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:46.933
No. I'd love to.

723
01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.541
- Hey. Marv. Marv. Marv.
- What?

724
01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:14.127
Look at this.

725
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:23.053
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

726
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.752
Dad. can you come here and help me?

727
01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:04.469
Remember that kid we saw the other day?
He lives here.

728
01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.472
Well. if the kid's there.
the parents gotta be.

729
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:10.142
He's home alone.

730
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.360
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

731
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.362
- Uh-huh.
- Even with the kid here?

732
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.573
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

733
01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:28.160
That house is the only
reason we started workin'
this block in the first place.

734
01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.954
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house. I wanted it.

735
01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:33.415
So let's take it
one step at a time. okay?

736
01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:37.043
We'll unload the van.
We'll get a bite to eat.
We'll come back about 9:00.

737
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.046
- 9:00.
- This way it's dark then.

738
01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:43.258
Yeah. Kids are scared of the dark.

739
01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:46.219
You're afraid of the dark too.
Marv. You know you are.

740
01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:49.014
No. I'm not!

741
01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.600
- Yes. you are.
- I'm not. not. not.

742
01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:55.937
- You are so.
- Mom. where are you?

743
01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.244
Do you play?

744
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.413
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

745
01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:15.791
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

746
01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.918
Okay.

747
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:45.612
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

748
01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:49.658
- Hey. nice shoes.
- Oh. thanks.

749
01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:53.411
Is he still here?
It's really important
that I see him.

750
01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:58.792
He's getting in his car.
I guess if you hurry.
you can catch him.

751
01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:03.338
Damn! How low can you get?
Givin' Kris Kringle a parking
ticket on Christmas Eve.

752
01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:06.550
What's next? Rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?

753
01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:09.261
Santa. hold on!

754
01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.471
Can I talk to you for a minute?

755
01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:14.558
If you make it quick.
Santa's got a little
get-together he's late for.

756
01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.560
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

757
01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:20.564
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

758
01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.316
I'm old enough to know how it works.

759
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.486
- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.

760
01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:29.614
- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

761
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.827
I'm Kevin McCallister.
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

762
01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:36.580
- Do you need the phone number?
- No. that's all right.

763
01:04:36.664 --> 01:04:38.874
Okay. This is extremely important.

764
01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:43.795
Would you please tell him that.
instead of presents this year.
I just want my family back.

765
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.800
No toys. Nothing
but Peter. Kate. Buzz.
Megan. Linnie and Jeff.

766
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.094
And my aunt and my cousins.

767
01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:54.431
And. if he has time.
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

768
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.269
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

769
01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:02.314
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

770
01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:05.567
My elf took the last of the
candy canes home to her boyfriend.

771
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.694
- That's okay.
- No. no. no. Don't be silly.

772
01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:10.780
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

773
01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.074
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

774
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:16.286
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

775
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.997
I won't. Thanks.

because you're young.

to see him anymore.

He said the same. and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

If you miss him.

No offense. but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

You can be a little old

You're never too old to be afraid.

been afraid of our basement.

It's dark. there's weird stuff
down there. and it smells funny.

It's bothered me for years.

Basements are like that.

865
01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.033
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry.

866

it's no big deal.

What if he won't talk to me?

871
01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:46.009
At least you'll know. Then you
could stop worrying about it.

872

afraid anymore.

- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared. Marv?

988
01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:47.511
Are you afraid?

- Go back.

- Hey. I'm calling the cops.

1000
01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:22.272
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
He wants us to follow him.

1001
01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:24.483
I got a better idea.
Come on.

1002
01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:45.754
Hiya. pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

Get over here!

1004
01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.388
What are we gonna do to him. Harry?

1005
01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:58.892
We'll do exactly what he did to us.
I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

1006
01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:01.144
Then we can smash his face with an iron!

1007
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:05.148
I'd like to slap him right in
the face with a paint can maybe.

1008
01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.734
Or shove a nail through his foot.

1009
01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:11.113
I'm gonna bite off every one of
these little fingers one at a time.

1010
01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:25.085
- Come on. Let's get you home.
- Whoa!

Wow. This is great.

1012

Nice move- always
leaving the water running.

I'm a bad parent.

you're beating yourself
up there. you know.

These things happen.
You know. you—

Gee. you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at— Look at us.

1036
01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:29.125
I mean. we're on the road
48. 49 weeks out of the year.
We hardly see our families.

1037
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:32.587
Uh. Joe over there—
Gosh. you know. he's—

1038

He forgets his kids' names
half the time.

He doesn't even—
He's never even met his kid.

Eddie- Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.

1041
01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:48.019
Tell me. have you ever gone on
vacation and left your child home?

1042

No.

1043
01:32:53.025 --> 01:32:56.528
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

1044
01:32:56.612 --> 01:32:58.822
Yeah. it was—
it was terrible too.

1045

You know. I was all
distraught and evertyhing.
You know. the wife and I.

we left the little tyke there
in the funeral parlor all day.

All day. You know.
and we went back at night
when we came to our senses.

Apparently he was there
alone all day with a corpse.

- Oh!
Whew. yeah. He was okay. you know.

After six. seven weeks.
you know. he came around
and started talking again.

1051
01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:26.224
But he's okay.
You know. they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well. you brought it up.
