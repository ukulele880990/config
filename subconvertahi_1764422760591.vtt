Derry. huh?

137
00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.299
I bet there's
zero nightclubs in this town.

138
00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.492
Probably not one decent
Chinese restaurant.

139
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.411
Come on. Pauly. We survived Korea.

140
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.514

you airmen personally.

145

How was the flight up?

146

- Smooth.
- A little bumpy.

147
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.971
Excellent. gentlemen. This way. please.

Your skills and experience
will be put to good use here. Major.

149
00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:30.648
DAFB is one of only six SAC bases
in the entire country.

150
00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.460
Now. it might seem somewhat remote.
but make no mistake.

151
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.962
As the northernmost continental
United States Air Force base.

152
00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.279
we are the tip of the spear.

153
00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:40.157
Soviet airspace is a brisk
seven-hour flight that way.

154
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.928
Straight over the Arctic Ocean
and on till morning.

155
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.971
In other words. when the nuclear shit

156
00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:47.415
hits the fan. we'll be the first call.

157
00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:51.043
If. If the nuclear shit
hits the fan.

158
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.003
I'm a bit of an optimist.

159
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.464
Yeah. I'm not.

160
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:05.391
Sir. what's that over there?

161
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.394
That's Special Projects.

162
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.649
Sounds special.

163
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.660
I understand you're only living
on base temporarily. Major.

164
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.929
Yes. sir.

165
00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:27.764
Renting a house in town.
just waiting for everything

166
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.516
to get all set up.
Should be finished by the time

167
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.934
my family gets here.

168
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.728
What. you don't want 'em
to live near Uncle Pauly?

169
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.229
Thought I was family. huh?

170
00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.982
Eight years living on base.
I just think my missus is ready

171
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.425
for a little taste of normal.

172
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:41.635
Well. if normal is what you're after.

173
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:44.138
you two are going to love Derry.

174
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.857
Hey. Lills. you okay? Jeez. I'm sorry.

175
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.903
It's a bunch of fucking cretins.
that's what they are.

176
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.696
I'm fine.

177
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:45.449
Guess I'll just stink
like pickle juice until dinner.

178
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.596
Well. if you ask me. you smell delicious.

179
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.183
Bert the Turtle says.
"Duck and Cover!"

180
00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:56.520
So. my aunt said we can come
on any weekend we want this summer.

181
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.188
Swell.

182
00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.898
My cousin Ray said
they have a bunch of parties

183
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.733
at the beach that are crazy.

184
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:03.860
They're supposed to be the ginchiest.

185
00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:06.095
What? What are you looking at?

186
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.680
My eyes?

187
00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:10.700
These new glasses
make them look huge. don't they?

188
00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:12.494
That optometrist is a sadist.

189
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.895
No. No. Marge. your eyes are fine.

190
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.582
- Sincerely.
- You have to promise me.

191
00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.334
because I'm not going
through the rest of the year

192
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.877
looking like some bug-eyed freak.

193
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:22.921
It's hard enough to get
Joey Navinsky to notice me

194
00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:24.756
- as it is.
- I mean. obviously.

195
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.782
we're not alone in the universe. right?

196
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:29.952
Did--

197
00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.621
Did Loony Lilly Bainbridge
just check us out?

198
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.891
- What?
- I don't know. My point is.

199
00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:36.685
what if the atomic age
changed everything

200
00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.396
and now we're a threat.
which is why visitors from the red planet

201
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.381
- are already here. secretly?
- In Derry?

202
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.884
Maybe that's what's going on
over that air base.

203
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:46.778
Maybe they've got one
of these things. like. on ice

204
00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:48.345
that they're experimenting with.

205
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.867
You've been sitting too close
to the TV again. haven't you?

206
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.870
My dad says those cathode rays
will shrink your balls. man.

207
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.415
I saw seven C-133's land there
in less than 48 hours.

208
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.959
Big. fat Cargomasters. Why?

209
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.985
What are they carrying? Think about it.

210
00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.993
You didn't study for the test
at all. did you?

211
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:07.990
What's the point
when World War III is imminent?

212
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.121
Duck and cover. Teds. Duck and cover.

213
00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:21.462
<i>So. to keep you groovy kids grooving.</i>

214
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.048
<i>here's Hasil Adkins
with "Chicken Walk."</i>

215
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.099
These are your men. Major.

216
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.851
Thank you. airman.

217
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.520
Afternoon. airmen.

218
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.314
Fall in!

219
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.316
Masters!

220
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.735
Look alive. men. Major on deck.

221
00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:49.031
Ten-hut!

222
00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:57.139
Major Hanlon. we've been expecting you.

223
00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.750
It's an honor. sir.
I'm First Airman O'Donnell.

224
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.920
This is the rest of 70th Squadron's MX.

225
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.733
First Airman Colton. Allard and Donahue.

226
00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.175
Staff Sergeant Ricciardi.

227
00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:10.594
and Airman
Second Class Masters. sir.

228
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.226
Airman Masters.

229
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:20.729
Now. I am your superior
commissioned officer.

230
00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:23.774
so I expect to be accorded
the respect of said rank.

231
00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:26.402
Do I make myself clear?

232
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:29.947
I'll get you next time. brother.

233
00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:31.883
Do we have a problem here?

234
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.158
Ten-hut!

235
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.452
No. sir. General Shaw.

236
00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:37.013
Remind me. Colonel.

237
00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:39.265
What's the penalty
for a Code 89 violation?

238
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.916
Court martial. sir.

239
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.878
So. I ask you once again.
do we have a problem?

240
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:55.639
- Walk with me. Major.
- Yes. sir.

241
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.686
I apologize.

242
00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:03.105
Not quite the welcome wagon
we intended.

243
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:06.525
Why don't you swing by my office tomorrow
around 1500 hours?

244
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.985
Get properly acquainted.

245
00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:09.945
Yes. sir. I'll be there.

246
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:18.579
Take me back to the Q. airman.

247
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.592
So. you're sucking up already. huh?

248
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:44.188
Why do they make brassieres so pointy?

249
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.125
I mean. boobs aren't that pointy.

250
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.376
Are we supposed to believe

251
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.070
that under a sweater
is just two pointy cones?

252
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.698
Are pointy cones better?

253
00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:59.387
Teds. Miss Johanssen
is about to take her bra off.

254
00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.181
Her boobs are gonna be out.

255
00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:02.331
What are you doing?

256
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:03.999
Homework. do you mind?

257
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.585
Here we go.

258
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.671
Ladies and gentlemen. we have lift-off.

259
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:12.883
Bet you five bucks
those aren't pointy cones.

260
00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.935
Damn it! Fucking Scotty did it again.

261
00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.106
Right. so where were we?

262
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.126
So. what we've got is pretty good so far.

263
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.420
I was just thinking that. like.
I know you're the story guy.

264
00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:33.838
but when he comes to Earth.

265
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:37.092
it could just be. like. killing people.

266
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.052
tearing guys' dicks off
with his tentacles.

267
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.870
or slurping their brains out
through a straw?

268
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.545
Or I could shove a grenade
up your ass and blow you up.

269
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.258
What's wrong. Teddy?

270
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.386
Today was four months.

271
00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.932
Four months to the day
since-- since Matty.

272
00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:07.146
Yeah. man. So messed up.

273
00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.751
Anyway. I'll keep working
on the illustrations.

274
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:13.527
I'm trying to talk about Matty.

275
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.131
What's talking about it
gonna do. bring him back to life?

276
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.174
They never even found a body.

277
00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:19.908
Don't start this again.

278
00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.952
That usually means he's a runaway.

279
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:24.097
He could have ran away.

280
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.498
- And why would he run away?
- Gee. I don't know.

281
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:28.476
Maybe because he had
just about no friends

282
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.811
in the whole wide world.

283
00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.813
and the only ones he did have
had to be paid

284
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.648
- to go to his birthday.
- We weren't paid.

285
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.276
- Candy isn't money. Teddy.
- Same thing.

286
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.695
His mom offered us
that candy fair and square.

287
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.738
We were doing her a favor. a good deed.

288
00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.907
We didn't even know it was his birthday.

289
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.367
Look. whatever happened to Matty

290
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:46.810
wasn't because we forgot
his stupid birthday. okay?

291
00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:52.542
None of this is our fault!

292
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.902
And whether you accept it or not.
Matty's dea--

293
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:48.080
Matty. where are we going?

294
00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:50.624
Trust me.

295
00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.711
Just one more flight.

296
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.639
It's closed to the public.
Has been for years.

297
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.160
But Phil and Teddy
tried sneaking in one day.

298
00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:11.204
They found out the caretaker
doesn't bother locking

299
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.480
the joint up anymore. You believe that?

300
00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:16.650
So...

301
00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:20.570
we turned it into
a sort of secret hangout.

302
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.075
The view is beautiful up here.

303
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:40.716
Nuts. I always get rocket ship.

304
00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.302
I got turtle. Trade you?

305
00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:47.055
Sure. Turtles are lucky.

306
00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:49.224
Hey.

307
00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.269
don't tell the guys I brought you here.

308
00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:54.163
Phil and Teddy. I mean.

309
00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:56.416
We're not supposed to bring guests

310
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.734
without checking in with each other first.

311
00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:01.111
It's not because
I'm Loony Lilly Bainbridge?

312
00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:05.240
You're not loony.
Not to me.

313
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.291
What happened that day? With your dad.

314
00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:22.507
Sorry. I shouldn't have--

315
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.264
My mom and I went to pick up my dad.

316
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.436
He worked at the jarring plant
out on Willoughby.

317
00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:37.105
You know. pickles and stuff.

318
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.585
We were leaving the factory
when I realized

319
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.611
I'd forgotten something inside.

320
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:47.657
This mood ring
I just bought at the five-and-dime.

321
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.637
It was just a cheap. stupid toy.

322
00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:53.497
but he went back to get it.

323
00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:58.502
And I don't know-- I don't know.
one of the machines jammed up.

324
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:04.007
It wasn't even his station. but my dad.

325
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.135
he always wanted to help.

326
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:12.349
They said he climbed into the gears.

327
00:23:14.017 --> 00:23:16.436
I guess he thought
he'd killed the power. but--

328
00:23:17.437 --> 00:23:19.874
When the foreman realized
it was on another station.

329
00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.358
it was too late.

330
00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.505
If I hadn't made him go back--

331
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:26.947
You couldn't have known.

332
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.075
It was just a terrible accident.

333
00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:54.015
Happy New Year.

334
00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.978
Thanks for letting me talk about it.

335
00:23:58.603 --> 00:23:59.855
No one else does.

336
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.567
Not Marge. Or the Pattycakes.

337
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:05.485
You're not like those girls.

338
00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:07.946
Starting to realize that.

339
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.782
For better or for worse. I guess.

340
00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:12.659
For better.

341
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.484
I'm sorry. That was stupid.

342
00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:30.194
No. it's okay.

343
00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:32.071
It's just that we're friends.

344
00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:33.781
It's fine. really.

345
00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:36.308
It is. I should head back anyway.

346
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.769
If my pop catches me out of bed
at this hour. he'll--

347
00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:43.899
I didn't mean it like that.

348
00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:47.777
I gotta go.

349
00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:50.447
Matty. wait!

350
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.336
Lilly.

351
00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:08.673
Don't forget to lay your clothes out
for tomorrow morning.

352
00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:12.928
Remember?

353
00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:16.097
We're going to visit
your father at the cemetery.

354
00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:21.353
If it's all the same.
I don't think I'm gonna go.

355
00:25:24.564 --> 00:25:25.565
It's been a year.

356
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.735
You haven't visited his grave even once.

357
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.446
I know. I'm just...

358
00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:34.074
not ready.

359
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:42.457
You're not the only person
to have something awful happen to them.

360
00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.710
The sooner you realize that. the better.

361
00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.755
Don't forget to take your medication.

362
00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:06.082
Friends. the idle brain
is the devil's playground.

363
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.876
Shameless music that'll grab your son

364
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.046
and your daughter with the arms
of a jungle animal instinct.

365
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.280
Mass'steria!

366
00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:17.617
We got trouble.
Right here in River City.

367
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.930
Trouble! Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!

368
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:23.391
Trouble! Trouble!
Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!

369
00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:24.624
Matty. is that you?

370
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.669
Where are you?

371
00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:33.526
Matty. if it's you. if you can hear me.

372
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.678
just come home. all right?
Just please come home.

373
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.391
He won't let me!

374
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:56.990
Matty Clements speaking to you
through the pipes?

375
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.366
Just forget it.

376
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:02.013
And seeing as how you barely
said one word to this kid

377
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:04.307
when he was alive.
why is it that he's reaching out to you

378
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:05.582
from beyond the grave?

379
00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:12.922
- Hi. Patty.
- Hi. Margie.

380
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.883
Just a sec.

381
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.178
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

382
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.472
What are you doing?

383
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:23.576
Making sure none of her friends
hear you talking like this

384
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.536
because what you're saying is crazy.

385
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.871
And I don't mean to use that word.

386
00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.688
- I don't--
- I know what I heard.

387
00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:31.524
Listen to me.

388
00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.586
We've only got
two more months till summer.

389
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.504
Let's just get through them
without giving everyone

390
00:27:35.528 --> 00:27:37.322
something new to whisper about you.

391
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.242
About me or about us?

392
00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:45.622
What's that supposed to mean?

393
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:50.168
It wasn't me.

394
00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:58.694
Are you worried about
what people will think of me

395
00:27:58.718 --> 00:28:01.846
or what Patty and all of them
will think of you because of me?

396
00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:06.619
Jesus. Lill. I'm trying to be your friend.

397
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:09.104
but sometimes you make it really hard.

398
00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:16.444
<i>That's my point. Teds.</i>

399
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.881
There has to be a reason
why men have nipples.

400
00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.031
Think about it.

401
00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.885
Maybe it's like
when we used to have tails and gills

402
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:24.345
and we just evolved out of it.

403
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.305
Or it's nature's way of telling us

404
00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:28.099
that we're second in line
to feed our babies

405
00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:29.475
should anything happen to women.

406
00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:31.310
Like aliens taking them back
to their world.

407
00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:32.395
When that day comes.

408
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:34.921
you and I are gonna be
breastfeeding like crazy.

409
00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.511
What are you doing here?

410
00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:45.807
And how much of that did you hear?

411
00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:49.102
I need to talk to you guys.

412
00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:50.579
Talk to us? About what?

413
00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:53.624
About how they found her dad's body parts
in pickle jars all over Maine?

414
00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:55.692
That's bullshit. It never happened.

415
00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.988
He swore he'd keep his mouth shut.

416
00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:02.490
We only brought him here. like. one time.

417
00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:05.660
One time? Weren't you guys best friends?

418
00:29:05.785 --> 00:29:07.120
It's complicated.

419
00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.205
Okay. so you're positive
it was Matty. right?

420
00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:11.040
It was his voice. I'm sure.

421
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.477
I don't know what it means. I just--

422
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.753
I thought if anyone would care.

423
00:29:14.961 --> 00:29:17.422
if anyone would believe me.
it'd be you guys.

424
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:21.509
Don't tell me you're buying
into this cock-a-doodle story.

425
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:22.987
You mean cockamamie?

426
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.072
It's both of those things. Okay?
This story's insane.

427
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.264
Look who it's coming from.

428
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:32.771
I know. It sounds impossible.
but maybe it's just improbable.

429
00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:36.751
Teddy. for this to be true.
Matty would have to still be alive.

430
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.502
And he'd have to know
where every single one

431
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:40.445
of Derry's pipes start and end.

432
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.865
And the exact time that Lilly
was about to take a bath.

433
00:29:44.532 --> 00:29:46.552
And how to aim his voice
down a certain pipe

434
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:49.370
so he could stick his little finger
up there and wave hello to her.

435
00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:54.334
Phil. you've explained one hundred ways
how aliens have come to Earth.

436
00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:58.004
Tracking our smells.
pretending to be dogs.

437
00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:00.673
- probing our anus.
- "Ani."

438
00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:04.403
You've "proven" all of that to me.

439
00:30:04.427 --> 00:30:06.280
yet you can't just believe

440
00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:11.309
that Matty is trying to get in contact
with someone he actually knows?

441
00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:13.436
So. you do believe me?

442
00:30:15.855 --> 00:30:16.981
Look...

443
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:20.235
Lilly. I want to. I'm trying to.

444
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:23.631
There's plenty
of unbelievable things out there

445
00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.157
that people believe.
and I'm sure some of them are true.

446
00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:30.203
I'm just not so sure about this one.

447
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.215
I can't believe you gave her your soda.

448
00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:58.982
Come on in. Major.

449
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:03.337
I wanted you to know that Masters

450
00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.488
is gonna spend the week
on latrine duty.

451
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:08.908
And a citation is going
on his permanent flight record.

452
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:12.912
I won't stand for that kind
of horseshit on my base.

453
00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:16.374
To less horseshit.

454
00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:26.426
I understand you served
under General Abbott in Korea.

455
00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:28.696
As he tells it. you. Major.

456
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.180
are about the bravest. damn pilot
he's ever met.

457
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.243
You flew a B-29 up MiG Alley
into the teeth

458
00:31:34.267 --> 00:31:36.603
of Soviet anti-aircraft fire at Sui-ho.

459
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:39.147
and made it back in one piece.

460
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.733
Almost one piece. sir.

461
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:44.986
And to be frank.
I don't much like to talk about it.

462
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:46.779
Your injury?

463
00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:49.282
Korea. sir.

464
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:51.326
And why is that?

465
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:54.996
Because we didn't finish the job.

466
00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.751
Well. that's why
we transferred you up here. Major.

467
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.480
To test our new B-52. and if necessary.

468
00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:05.608
fly it straight
into the heart of the enemy.

469
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.091
Finish what you started.

470
00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:13.765
Why the Air Force?

471
00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:16.392
I was raised on a farm.

472
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:19.288
We had a family friend
that would come twice a month

473
00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:21.564
to dust the fields. So. my father.

474
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.584
he wanted me to tag along. And I--

475
00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.401
I just took to it. you know?

476
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.655
How about you. sir?

477
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:31.032
My dad.

478
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:33.576
Army man.

479
00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.956
Fought in every American conflict
from the Indian Wars to the Philippines.

480
00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:41.143
'til they shoved him behind a desk.

481
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:44.128
Only thing he loved more
than his country was his family.

482
00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:48.800
Told me the proudest moment of his life
was when I signed up to be a Doughboy.

483
00:32:52.428 --> 00:32:54.889
I can only imagine your father
felt the same way.

484
00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:57.892
He was proud. all right.

485
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.622
He used to always say
there's nothing wrong

486
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:05.566
with this country that can't be fixed
by what's right with this country.

487
00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.698
I aim to prove him right. sir.

488
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:37.932
- Amen.
- Amen.

489
00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:39.308
- Amen.
- Amen.

490
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.112
- Amen.
- Amen.

491
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.872
My son. the bar mitzvah boy.

492
00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:02.856
How's the haftarah studying coming?

493
00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.043
Tastes good.

494
00:34:08.504 --> 00:34:10.089
Something the matter. Theodore?

495
00:34:13.509 --> 00:34:14.886
Can I ask you a weird question?

496
00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:17.305
Sure.

497
00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:19.575
Do you think somebody
could kidnap a kid

498
00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:20.850
and keep him underground?

499
00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.228
- Underground?
- What is wrong with you?

500
00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:29.835
Yeah. just keep him there.
in the sewers for months and months.

501
00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:31.486
hurting him or...

502
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:33.905
I don't know.

503
00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:36.991
Have you ever heard
of something like that?

504
00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:41.496
Your grandparents escaped Buchenwald.

505
00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:43.956
their entire families murdered.

506
00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:46.793
the skin of Jewish prisoners

507
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:49.462
used for lampshades.

508
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:51.589
What?

509
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.841
Lampshades.

510
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:57.613
We are Jews. Theodore.

511
00:34:57.637 --> 00:35:00.723
We know better than anyone
the real horrors of this world.

512
00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:05.478
Reality is terrifying enough as it is.

513
00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:10.274
Cut it out with the fantasy.

514
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.168
I can't believe we're related.

515
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.787
I'm next. right?

516
00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:30.891
- So. now you believe me.
- Listen. Lilly.

517
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.643
I've known this guy since first grade.

518
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:33.894
And I know when he's lying.

519
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.980
and he is not lying
about this lampshade shit.

520
00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:38.315
We have to tell someone.

521
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.758
- No one's gonna believe us.
- What if we go to our parents?

522
00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:44.428
If I tell anyone about all of this.
I'll wind up right back at Juniper Hill.

523
00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:47.014
Maybe you guys will be in there with me.

524
00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.910
I can't go to the loony bin. Teddy.

525
00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.520
I couldn't make it
through goddamn sleepaway camp.

526
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:54.063
Okay.

527
00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:56.774
We don't tell anyone.

528
00:37:57.483 --> 00:37:59.443
until we figure out
what really happened to Matty.

529
00:38:02.196 --> 00:38:03.281
And how do we do that?

530
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.576
I think I might know where to start.

531
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:24.987
You see anything?

532
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:26.655
Teddy. did you know
that there are more than

533
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.264
a hundred books in this library?

534
00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:30.725
No way. More than a hundred?

535
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.161
And did you know
that some of them have pictures

536
00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:34.621
but most of them don't have pictures?

537
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:35.622
What is she doing here?

538
00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.082
My folks couldn't find a sitter. okay?

539
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:38.983
And did you know
that when you take out a book.

540
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.336
you have to sign your name?
I can sign mine in cursive.

541
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.280
Miss Carmel says
I have the best handwriting in the class.

542
00:38:45.614 --> 00:38:46.699
Phil.

543
00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:51.638
Hey. Suze. I need a really good handwriter

544
00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.640
to help me with finding a book.

545
00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:56.792
It's called <i>Bucket Full of Muffins.</i>

546
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:01.339
I'll do it.

547
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:06.385
She'll never find it.

548
00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.140
Wait. there it is.

549
00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.956
They thought it could be
a runaway initially.

550
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.624
but when he never turned up
anywhere else.

551
00:39:19.648 --> 00:39:21.692
they presumed homicide.

552
00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:25.071
That means murder.

553
00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:29.158
They thought
it could have been Matty's dad.

554
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.596
Could have been a drifter.
but they never found anyone.

555
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.056
"According to police sources.

556
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.516
the boy was last seen
the night of January 4th

557
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.811
at the Capitol Theater
by the daughter of a theater employee.

558
00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:41.962
an unidentified 12-year-old girl."

559
00:39:46.258 --> 00:39:47.468
Who's that?

560
00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:49.887
Matty Clements?

561
00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:53.015
Jesus Christ. get the hell out of here!

562
00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.433
Get out!

563
00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:57.103
What? What did we say?

564
00:39:58.604 --> 00:40:00.624
Do you know how many times
the police came round

565
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:03.317
about that boy?
Trying to fix it on my pops?

566
00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:07.238
Did your newspaper article
mention anything about that?

567
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.258
I really only skimmed. so--

568
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.492
Just leave!

569
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.619
Can we go get a shake now?

570
00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:18.124
See. I told you guys
this was a bad idea.

571
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.459
chasing a song you heard
in the fucking sewers.

572
00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:25.005
What did you say?

573
00:40:31.303 --> 00:40:32.304
It was a song.

574
00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:36.016
I heard Matty singing it
a couple nights back.

575
00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:38.811
From the drainpipe in my tub.

576
00:40:41.564 --> 00:40:43.023
You heard him too?

577
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:49.363
I don't know if it was Matty.
but I did hear voices

578
00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:53.909
in the basement of the Capitol.
in the pipes.

579
00:40:55.327 --> 00:40:59.582
Kids laughing. crying. calling my name.

580
00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:05.254
What song was he singing?

581
00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:41.660
The new B-52. G-class.
They transferred you up here to fly it.

582
00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:44.621
If you wanna walk out of here alive.
you're gonna give us the specs.

583
00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:49.084
Speed. range. flight ceiling.
payload. arms. everything.

584
00:42:49.108 --> 00:42:50.317
Understand?

585
00:42:50.818 --> 00:42:53.088
I'd understand you better
if you took off that mask.

586
00:42:53.112 --> 00:42:54.947
The specs. Now.

587
00:42:55.614 --> 00:42:57.283
It's classified.

588
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.591
This isn't a fucking game.

589
00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:17.052
The specs. or I pull the trigger
on the count of three.

590
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.973
One.

591
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:29.732
Two.

592
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.778
You're gonna have to pull that trigger.

593
00:43:38.324 --> 00:43:40.135
- Leroy!
- Yo. Lee. what's going on?

594
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:41.994
Lee. open the door!

595
00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.435
Open the door! Yo. Lee.
what's going on in there?

596
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.020
Open the door!

597
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:51.837
Lee. open the fucking door!

598
00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:08.646
Get the fuck out of here!

599
00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.315
Yeah. that's what I thought.

600
00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:16.820
Saved your ass again.

601
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.133
- Fuck you. Pauly.
- Who the fuck were those guys?

602
00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:21.408
I don't know.

603
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:24.286
Jesus Christ.

604
00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:28.916
How's my hair?

605
00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:31.627
It's still greasy.

606
00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:39.402
So. where the hell are we going?

607
00:44:39.426 --> 00:44:41.970
You want me to tell you
or you want me to show you?

608
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:44.324
Tell. One hundred percent tell.

609
00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:47.393
The song Matty was singing comes
from the movie <i>The Music Man.</i>

610
00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.978
We should have another print
up in the storage room.

611
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:54.483
And why do we wanna watch
this stupid thing?

612
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.527
I hate musicals.

613
00:44:57.403 --> 00:44:59.905
Because maybe Matty was trying
to tell us something.

614
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:13.085
Holy crap. it's dark in here.

615
00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.523
Guys. isn't this breaking and entering?

616
00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.566
We didn't break anything.
It's just entering.

617
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.759
- Don't be such a baby.
- Guys. stop.

618
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.302
Let's just sit.

619
00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:38.420
Just a second!

620
00:45:38.444 --> 00:45:40.446
Loading up <i>The Music Man!</i>

621
00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:47.244
Teds. is that you?

622
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:51.415
- Is he crying?
- What? No.

623
00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:53.208
Shut up. you guys.

624
00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:56.754
Lilly. are you okay?

625
00:45:58.297 --> 00:46:00.466
Yeah. No. I'm fine. I'm just...

626
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:04.112
...thinking about Matty
and what happened.

627
00:46:04.136 --> 00:46:06.364
and what I could have
done different. and--

628
00:46:06.388 --> 00:46:07.639
Well. he needed me.

629
00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:10.934
And instead. I just sent him away.

630
00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:13.270
Then he was gone.

631
00:46:15.647 --> 00:46:16.982
What we did was worse.

632
00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:20.712
Maybe if we'd been there
like we said we would

633
00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:23.506
at his birthday. maybe things
would be different.

634
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.407
It's nobody's fault. okay?

635
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.971
Teds. it's not your fault.
Lilly. it isn't your fault either.

636
00:46:29.995 --> 00:46:32.098
We're here now. That's what matters.

637
00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.624
So just stop it. okay?

638
00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:38.754
Are you crying?

639
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:41.089
What? No. I'm not crying.

640
00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:43.050
Nobody's crying.

641
00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:45.528
<i>...with Sen-Sen
One fine night</i>

642
00:46:45.552 --> 00:46:46.821

- We've surely got trouble</i>

654
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.886
It's the song. That's the song I heard.

<i>- We've surely got trouble
- We've surely got trouble...</i>

672
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.199
Wait. what? What's going on?

673
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:51.761
How is he in the goddamn movie?

674
00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:53.346
What's happening?
How is this possible?

675
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.080
- Can he see us?
- Matty!

676
00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:57.475
- Is he listening?
- Matty!

677
00:47:57.499 --> 00:47:58.726
Matty. we're over here! Matty!

678
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.918
- Matty!
- Hey!

679
00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.522
- Follow our voices!
- Matty! Wait.

680
00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:05.066
- Yes! Come on. Matty!
- Yes! Yes. Matty. that's it!

681
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:06.901
- Follow our voices!
- We're right here! Keep going!

682
00:48:06.925 --> 00:48:08.319
Matty. yes!

683
00:48:08.343 --> 00:48:10.446
Yes. that's right! Yes!

684
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:11.763
Matty. come on!

685
00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.617
<i>Lilly? Teddy?</i>

686
00:48:14.641 --> 00:48:16.703
- Yeah. it's us!
- Come on!

687
00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.770
Matty. come on. we're gonna get you out!

688
00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.107
<i>No. you won't.</i>

689
00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:24.860
<i>You're the reason I'm in here.</i>

690
00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:26.904
<i>'Cause you lied.</i>

691
00:48:29.865 --> 00:48:32.159
<i>'Cause you weren't there.</i>

692
00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:35.037
What's happening?

693
00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:09.655
What the hell is that?

694
00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:21.184
- Where did it go?
- What the fuck is that thing?

695
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:24.103
I told you weird shit was going on
over at that airbase!
