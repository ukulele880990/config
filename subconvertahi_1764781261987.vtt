So we fight.

It doesn't even feel like killing.

21

But that won't change who we truly are.

26

You and I will always be manslayers.
no matter what.

Lord Okubo. please listen to me.

This rebellion is our chance
to finally destroy the samurai.

96
00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.250
We must exterminate them.
or else they will rebel once again.

97
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:24.958
All I'm asking is for you
to grant us the right to carry guns.

-I won't.
-Why not. sir?

99
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.750
What will you do if one of them tries
to sneak in and assassinate you?

100
00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.125
How will we protect you?

101
00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:35.041
Have them forfeit their swords.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:38.541
-That is all I can allow.
-[Kawaji] Okubo!

103

[sighs] We shouldn't use too heavy a hand.

104
00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:44.625
It will only lead to new uprisings.

105
00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:47.625
Remember Kyoto
during the shogunate's final days?

106
00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:50.416
Think of how many
of our comrades had fallen back then.

107
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.000
killed by the swords of samurai assassins.

108
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:55.250
Should they plot to kill us.

109
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:57.291
we have no way
of defending ourselves against them.

110
00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:59.375
Their speed and power are unstoppable!

111
00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:03.666
We need to be able to bear firearms
for the sake of the future of Japan.

112
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:07.458
There is no point
in fighting brute force with brute force!

113
00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.333
The future of Japan. you say.

114
00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.875
Do you know what Japan must have
in order to grow stronger as a nation?

115
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.041
-The people. Kawaji!
-And the people need to be protected!

122
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.250

You can go.

150
00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:31.416
Is that all right?

151
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:32.958
Sure.

152
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:37.750
Thank you so much.

Are you sure?

154
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.208
We have two days
before the appointment. and…

155
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:50.250
these could be our last days together.

156
00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:12.666
Strange to see you
with that look on your face.

157
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:15.333
What do you mean?

158
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:21.583
You look like a father

159
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.166
Did having a family make you happy?

160

Yes.

161

I was able to live life peacefully.
without killing anybody.

164
00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:28.500
So I would do
whatever it takes to save them.

165

[Iroha] As for me…

166
00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:44.708
I've only been thinking of one thing.

167
00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:49.750
I should've just died
in the battle for succession.

168
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.708
It'd be better than this life.

Shinnosuke.

195
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.333
In this world. some things are better
left kept in the dark. okay?

196

No. sir.

We've checked at his home as well.
but he doesn't appear to be back.

481
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:35.791
Should we have the police look for him?

482
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:42.750
No. We'll search for him ourselves.
Inform the Home Ministry staff.

00:42:51.208 --> 00:42:53.375
-Hey. you two.
-[Sansuke] Hm?

550
00:42:56.166 --> 00:42:57.875
I had a dream last night.

551
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.000
I saw us all living together as a family.

552
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:08.458
Sansuke and I were arguing.
like we always did.

553
00:43:11.791 --> 00:43:13.541
Shikura was strong as always.

554
00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:17.875
We all used to smile a lot back then.

555
00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:21.625
[chuckles softly] Sure.

556
00:43:22.583 --> 00:43:23.958
We certainly did.

557
00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:28.875
Had we all fought each other
for the succession.

558
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.041
I would not have survived.

559
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:41.833
If Shujiro hadn't decided to run away…

560
00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:44.666
[brooding music playing]

561
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:49.166
…I certainly wouldn't be alive right now.

562
00:43:56.125 --> 00:43:58.583
But unless we're able to defeat Gentosai.

563
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.416
we will never manage to move forward.

564
00:44:16.541 --> 00:44:18.208
Once we're all together.

565
00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:21.583
we can finally take him down.

566
00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:25.375
You know it too.

567
00:44:27.958 --> 00:44:30.416
We cannot defeat him
unless we're together.

568
00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:38.166
[Sansuke] You're right.

569
00:44:39.458 --> 00:44:40.708
And we'll do it.

570
00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:42.750
[Shikura] Yes.

571
00:44:43.416 --> 00:44:46.041
So now. we gather our brothers.

572
00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:50.166
[indistinct chatter]

573
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.041
[brooding music continues]

574
00:44:58.166 --> 00:44:59.166
[sighs]

575
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:01.583
[dramatic music playing]

576
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:04.958
-[man 1] Oh!
-Attacked in Shimizudani. [laughs]

577
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:06.416
I can't believe he actually did it!

578
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.916
Kawaji's a man of action. truly.
Wouldn't you agree?

579
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.666
Now we can focus on the Kodoku in peace!

580
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:12.875
Indeed.

581
00:45:13.458 --> 00:45:16.708
There are plenty
of remarkable contestants left to watch.

582
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:18.708
The weak ones are gone.

583
00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:21.416
From here. only the strong remain.

584
00:45:28.791 --> 00:45:32.125
-[men exclaiming. laughing]
-[man 2] Well. well.

585
00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:34.458
CHIRYU. OKAZAKI. HAMAMATSU. SHIMADA

586
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:38.333
Now. gentlemen.

587
00:45:38.833 --> 00:45:41.666
We guarantee this Kodoku
will keep you entertained.

588
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.583
-Hear. hear.
-Hear. hear.

589
00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:46.916
-[man 1] Hey! Wait for me!
-[man 2] Go! Quick!

590
00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:48.875
[groaning]

591
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.708
-[man 1] Let's play some more.
-[groaning]

592
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:54.791
[man 1 grunts]

593
00:45:57.166 --> 00:45:58.041
Well. lucky me.

594
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:01.125
No one was around.
so I didn't get enough tags earlier.

595
00:46:02.958 --> 00:46:03.791
[groans]

596
00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:05.125
[man 1 grunts]

597
00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:12.500
Good. That's enough for now.

598
00:46:14.375 --> 00:46:17.000
Oh. Do you want to fight. sir?

599
00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:19.291
[exhales sharply]

600
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:20.375
It's fun!

601
00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:22.041
Come on. Why not?

602
00:46:23.166 --> 00:46:25.041
[dramatic music continues]

603
00:46:34.416 --> 00:46:36.000
[Kamuykocha praying in Ainu]

604
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.375
[bell tinkling]

605
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.625
Well. well. so you couldn't get it done.

606
00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:53.958
[chuckles]
Even with the tip I gave you. huh?

607
00:46:54.041 --> 00:46:55.041
[gasps]

608
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.250
Fight to the death.
until the last one standing.

609
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:14.208
[yelling]

610
00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:19.375
[dramatic music intensifies]

611
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.666
LAST SAMURAI STANDING

612
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.416
THE END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER

613
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.500

614
00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:29.916
